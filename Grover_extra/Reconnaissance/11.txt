MORIA, South Africa (AP) â€” South Africa's president has said he will not seek a second term in office after he was impeached for corruption and war crimes last year.

President Jacob Zuma is due to make his final visit to South Africa during a visit to the continent met by the European Union, Japan, Taiwan and the United States.

Mr Zuma is due to be inaugurated as president on July 8. He is expected to be the first South African president in 50 years.

Mr Zuma was impeached in a war of aggression of which the South African government is responsible.

The country has been under security since the war of aggression.

He has continued to serve as president of South Africa for more than four years.
