Let's review some of the key issues that we are facing. Firstly, we need to catch the end of the fire within the next few months and we need to receive your positive response. But what is more important is that we get your word that we will NOT change our policy. Any problems we hear from you do not come as a surprise. We are trying to find a way to give you assurance that we will be 100% in control of the project. We need your help in this. We are making a concerted effort to make sure that your services are kept to a minimum. But we must not give up hope. We must always be ready to offer our services to any person willing to assist us. Your assistance will enable us to get this project out of existence and get back to you in as little as 3 weeks. Your help will enable us to get this project where we are in need of it. You will not be the last to hear about this matter. Please share this with your colleagues and employers.
The first thing we must do is to follow through on our mission of making this project work. We are very grateful to you for your help.
We have been in contact with any major international companies that will be interested in the project. We are also looking to get your assistance in this regard. We are also looking to get your assistance in a project of this magnitude. But we are not going to give up the hope of success.
Please let us know what you will do to assist us. We will be glad if you share this with your colleagues and employers.
