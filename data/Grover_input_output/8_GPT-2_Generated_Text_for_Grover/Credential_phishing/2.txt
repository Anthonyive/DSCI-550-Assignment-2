Re: A letter from my client regarding the transfer of a motor vehicle into my client's name.
From:
Otto Dusseldorf,
A motor/motorcycle, my client, has declared that he is receiving death threats from various foreign nationals.
I have decided to seek for a foreign attorney to represent him, because he is a highly reputable civil contractor who has been in a good relationship with my client.
I can assure you that this is not a business transaction.
My client is an individual with a very poor credit history. The bank, institutes a strict confidentiality policy to protect his confidential information. We have had no contact with him for a while now.
My client has decided to move into the UK for a job that can pay him the money he has left behind.
I have called my firm on a confidential number to discuss the matter. However, the telephone and fax numbers are reliable but not reliable.
I contacted the man who is involved in the transfer of the motor vehicle to my client's name and was unsuccessful in contacting his official phone and fax numbers.
The reasons for his death are not known to me. I am contacting the bank to seek for a foreign person to represent him.
The bank has not confirmed my client's identity. At this point, the only thing that I can do is confirm that his name is the same as his name.
I have been in contact with my lawyer since the transfer of the motor vehicle. I have not heard from the bank either. Since the transfer, the bank has not confirmed his identity. The last thing I need is for my client to change his name and claim his share of the investment.
I am contacting my attorney and his firm to seek for a foreign foreign person. We have no money left and the bank has no real interest in this transaction.
Due to my client's poor credit history, my client is seeking money for the future investment. We are waiting for your assistance.
I sincerely hope that you will not disappoint and give me your utmost confidence. Please, give me your best regards.
Best regards,
E.D.
