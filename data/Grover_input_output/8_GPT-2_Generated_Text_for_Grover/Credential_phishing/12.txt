The reason I am writing this is that since the start of the year, the government has been in the business of selling gold to foreign banks. The bank has actually used the money to pay interest on the deposit, but has not been able to pay back the bank. However, I decided to contact the bank on the condition that the money will be transferred to an account in your country where you can claim your deposit in the next 12 months.
I am now writing this to solicit your assistance in finding a foreign bank that will handle the transfer of the money to your account. I am also interested in your assistance in locating a foreign bank that is willing to use the deposit to pay interest on the deposit. I am also interested in your honest and reliable assistance in finding a worthy foreign bank willing to handle this transaction.
Please, I will not want you to be the only one who does not trust me in this matter. I intend to contact you on the following lines:
1. That you can give the bank a positive sum for the transfer of the money to your account. 2. That you will not give the bank any of the money that the bank may ask for for personal use. 3. That the bank will also issue a notice to the users, who should read through this notice to ensure that the money is transferred to your account with your name and address.
I hope you will help by contacting me through this form, as I have no other choice but to contact you through this form.
I give you 60% of the total sum and 60% for me to use for administration.
Best regards,
Caleb.
Dear Sir,
I am a member of the National Security Committee. I am a member of the Committee on Security and Cooperation in Europe (C.S.C.) and the Security Assistance and Assistance Committee (SACCOM). I am very pleased to note that part of my colleagues partners' foreign banks are currently in closed business, including all foreign deposits with the assistance of foreign accounts of my colleagues. I have since discovered that my colleagues have been using my bank to finance foreign accounts of my colleagues and to finance foreign accounts of their colleagues. I have also discovered that the foreign accounts of my colleagues have been used by foreign banks to finance foreign accounts.
Though I am the only member of the committee, my colleagues are the only ones who have been used of my bank to finance foreign accounts.
I am writing to ask you to give me as a reward a percentage of the total money transferred to your account and the amount of the interest paid on the deposit.
I want to assure you that this transaction will be executed within a reliable and honest business arrangement. I will not have any reason to believe that this transaction will not be successful.
I am contacting you to discuss this matter with your colleagues. I am not a lawyer or a private citizen and I will not have the information required to prove my client's claim. I am going to advise you to include this information in your application to our bank as a part of the transfer of the money.
In your letter, I explained to you that I am a former member of the Committee on Security and Cooperation in Europe (C.S.C.) and the Security Assistance and Assistance Committee (SACCOM).
