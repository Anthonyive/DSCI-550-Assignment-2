BHALAM AL-SAHIM, MBE Chief, Foreign Office.
I have been informed by your assistance that the Minister of Foreign Affairs for this Government, Mr. Nasser Omar, has declared the plight of the Christian community in the country to be a holy war. The fact that Christian Christians are not allowed to receive assistance in any form from the Government of this Government, I believe, is a breach of trust.
The Minister has declared that the Christian community in the country is in grave danger because of the war in Iraq which has lasted since 2003 and I believe that this Government is capable of securing a foreign bank account for the security of the Christian Churches in the country.
I am going to ask you to assist me in locating and securing a foreign bank account for this Government for the purpose of securing the release of the Christian Christians not in the country.
