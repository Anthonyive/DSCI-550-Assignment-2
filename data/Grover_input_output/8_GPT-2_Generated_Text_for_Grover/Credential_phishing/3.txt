I got your email from me and need to get your contact details. Since I am a former member of the Presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , I therefore need to contact you for your assistance in locating your information.
Please see the next of kin and the next of kin of your deceased relatives for more information. I have already paid your deposit, which I secretly and secretly kept for you. Please give me a huge sum of money as the advance for some investment venture. I will arrange for you to keep this money in your account in the US, but we shall not be able to get your name in any government 
Department or any civil government in the world, so I want you to set up a company here in your country and give it your name as the beneficiary. All you have to do is give me your phone number and fax number and I will send you the bank account where the money will be transferred.
I also want to guarantee that there is no hitch in the transaction as you have all necessary documents in your possession to finally get your name and the beneficiary into your bank account.
Best regards,
Nancy Tosca
Nancy Tosca is a former member of the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the first African republic to have the government of President Joseph Nkomo as its president.
After the death of his father, who was involved in a coup d'etat, the foreign minister of Congo, Filippo Nkomo, was assassinated by the American mercenaries, who took over the country. Since then, the US government has been providing arms, ammunition, and other assistance to the rebels in the country, including $5.5 billion dollars.
President Nkomo has been holed up in a secret compound in the capital, Durban, South Africa. All the above documents are in the possession of the Foreign Ministry of Congo, as well as the foreign minister of Congo. There are also some documents that are in a foreign country, but which have not been released to the foreign ministry.
However, the foreign minister of Congo does not want any of this money, because he is a foreigner. Therefore, the foreign minister has decided to give the money secretly to his private account in the country.
Mr. Robert Nystrom, the current president of Congo, has been murdered by the American mercenaries, who took over the country.
Since then, the US government has been providing arms, ammunition, and other assistance to the rebels in the country, including $5.5 billion dollars. But since Mr. Nystrom was murdered, the government of Congo has been giving the money to foreign accounts in the country. In the meantime, the foreign minister of Congo has decided to give the money secretly to his private account in the country.
Now that the money has been given to you by the people of Congo, I want you to contact me and tell me about the money, because you will not be able to find the money in the bank.
Please note that I am not a member of any foreign business company, so I need to pay both the foreign Ministry and you personally, plus the sum of US$5.5 billion dollars in your account, 10% of the total sum to be used for the expenses of the payment, and the remaining 20% to be used by you for the following purposes:
1. To enable you to assist me in obtaining your name and the percentage of the total sum in your account, and also to enable you to provide me with your personal phone and fax numbers and address for all my business contacts.
2. To assist me with the provision of your bank account for the money you will receive from the above mentioned parties.
