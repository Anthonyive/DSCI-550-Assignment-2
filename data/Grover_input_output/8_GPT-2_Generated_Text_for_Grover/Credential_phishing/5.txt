I don't like this story. It is full of lies and lies that are the truth. They are so false that I have to call a lawyer. But I will not disappoint you.The fact is that I am in a position to introduce my client to the correct person. I had been in the business of selling securities for three years. I am a highly regarded business person, not one to give my clients undue advantage.
I have always been a big believer in the role of a reliable manager in a company and it has been in my sincere wish to introduce myself to them.
I am a German-American, and have been involved in a number of securities dealings in the past; most controversially, I was the co-chair of the security consulting firm in the deal on which the firm won a 10% share of the share, and this fund was not transferred to a foreign account. As the co-chair of the firm, I was in charge of all administrative and legal matters, and also of securing the account balance for the fund transfer to be transferred to another account, as a result of the death of my co-chair in that deal.
I am ready to give you the confidence to invest in a company that will be 100% reliable and 100% honest. I will not betray your trust in this transaction, because I believe that the confidence you will have will provide you with the funds necessary to fund the transaction.
The account will be fully owned by my client, who is a former automobile company official who is currently in the Foreign Ministry in the Netherlands.
The bank will be ready to pay any amount you wish to deposit, but I need you to ensure that the money is not lost. I need your honest cooperation so that I can invest in a company that will be 100% reliable and 100% honest.
I have a lot of money in hand, but I don't want to risk it in the name of the company, as the bank will have to pay interest to the fund transfer, and I will not forget to turn over the money to the bank.
I will make every effort to get the bank to pay the interest on the funds, but you will be the one to pay the interest, so that you can invest in the company while the balance is in your account. I am ready to provide you with the names of the banks in the Netherlands, as the people involved.
I want you to invest in the company, because I am from a country that is not a country of the banking sector. And I want you to invest in any company that is going to be 100% reliable and 100% honest.
I want you to invest with confidence. I am ready to invest in a company that will be 100% reliable and 100% honest.
