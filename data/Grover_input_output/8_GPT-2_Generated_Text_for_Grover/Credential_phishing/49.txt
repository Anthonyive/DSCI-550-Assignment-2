A new report on the total number of victims of the London Bridge explosion is expected to be released on April 24th, with the claim of the money going to charity.
The report by the Committee to Prosecute the Abusers of the London Bridge and East London Bridge, based on interviews with several account holders and concerned parties, has been released to the public.
The report said that over 40% of the total amount, which was transferred to a trust account in the Department of Finance, was for charity.
The money was issued to persons who died on the bridge.
The committee called for the investigation of both the Ministry of Finance and the New Zealand Department of Finance to determine the source of the money. Most of the money was for a particular fund that the Ministry of Finance had been holding in account for the past year.
The report said that the fund was for charity, however, some of the account holders had died in the line of duty.
The committee said that the Ministry of Finance, the number of account holders in the fund, and the fund's security company were all involved.
The report said that the fund was used to fund the expenses of the investigations and inquiries into the nature of the accident.
The committee also said that the money is for non-life-threatening reasons. It is safe to say that the fund's security company is not involved.
