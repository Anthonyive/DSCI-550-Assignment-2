'I want to make people forget about the fact that I am the President of Israel. I have met with the deceased president of Israel and he has declared that he has the privilege of taking over the country and that I should respect this position and the will of the people and this is the truth. I ask that you respect the integrity of the position of president of Israel in this respect and honestly to not forget what I have said. Please do not forget me and respect my integrity.

It is not my policy to declare my policy or to name any person or entity; however, I have a lot of respect for the fact that I have given your utmost respect and confidence to the President of Israel and to my life and the destiny of the country.

I am the father and mother of the deceased President. I am a polished and humble man, used to work with small businesses.

I have worked with my wife, who was my late wife for 12 years, since the mid-80's. I have also worked with my son, a political leader of my party, being assassinated in the late 70's.
