M.P.<|endoftext|>The Belgian president on Tuesday appointed a special commission to investigate claims that he ordered the murder of a government official in his office in the capital Brussels.
The commission is expected to look into the allegations and to determine whether there is a link between the death of the official and the commission's investigation into possible involvement of the Belgian security services in the attack on the Brussels offices of a political party last year.
The president's office has since been linked to the murder of a political party member in the capital, the most senior government official in Europe, who was the head of state in the country.
Baroness Milena Pardieu, the chief of staff to the president, was shot dead by security forces from a security van.
The president claims he was not there to assist Pardieu during her death, but to simply hide in the United States.
The president claims that there has been a political rift in Belgium and that his administration has no interest in the United States and the security services of the country.
"During my visit to Belgium to seek the assistance of the United States for my official duties, I met with a political figure who told me that he is an associate of the president of Belgium who wished to get the assistance of the United States as an alternative to the security services of Belgium.
