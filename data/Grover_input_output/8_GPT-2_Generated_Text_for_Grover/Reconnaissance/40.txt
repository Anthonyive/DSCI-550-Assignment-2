I've been thinking of a way to build a corner for my work, but after researching a lot and looking at the various projects, I decided to put it all on hold. I don't want to be the sole owner of this project, but I want to be able to make the investment in the business possible.
I totally understand the need for you to be the sole owner of this business, but I also want you to invest the money in me while I am still alive.
A special thanks to my uncle who donated to the treasury of the Ministry of Finance.
I do not have a complete picture of this project, but it is working very well.
Please let me know if you are interested in investing this money in me, so I can make sure I have the right person to fund this investment and make it happen.
Please note that this project is for personal use only.
Please note that, within this project is the sole responsibility of the individual responsible for the investment, so I cannot guarantee that the funds will be used to any other purpose.
Please also note that the fund used to fund the project is not to be used to get me an education in finance, but to finance my expenses incurred as a child under the age of 14.
Please, keep this project simple and secure.
If you are interested in investing this money, please contact me through my personal email address: kanfoto@hotmail.com.
Regards,
Kotaku East East Staff

I have been playing with this project for a while now, and I have me the most ready. I have decided not to do any thing to the project if I get it wrong. I know that if this project is wrong, I will lose my position as American lawyer in the Federal Government. I am going to wait another five years before I claim this position as a foreigner, so I am afraid of any potential trouble. I am also afraid of becoming involved in the business of this project, because of my proclivity for foreign investment. I have decided to use this money to invest in a company which I will not want to fail. I don't want to get in the way of this project. I am afraid that this business will get in the way of me succeeding in the business.
