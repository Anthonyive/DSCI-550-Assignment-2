SINCAGIA DEVELOPMENT
I am a young man from a prosperous family. I lived in a prosperous family in the past and was once married to a wealthy merchant. I have two younger sisters but we are out of the country because of the war in Iraq. My father died in the pogrom in 2003. He was murdered in a mob attack by the rebels in the capital of Diyala. I managed to escape the capital in 2003 and come to some prosperous and prosperous area in Nigeria. Now I am leaving for Europe and am going to seek a better life for my father.
I am writing this letter for my late husband whose family supported me and we have decided to move to a better country. I am writing to you to help me in this effort because I was widowed by my late husband. He died in the pogrom and many of our family members were killed by rebels. I am making this plea for your assistance because we are both widows. I know that your assistance will enable me to move to a better country to help me.
I am writing this letter in the hope of making you a better person and a better person in my family that will be better able to handle the present crisis in Nigeria.
I am seeking for a reliable source of money to enable me to move to a better country so that I can have more children. I am also seeking for financial assistance to enable me to relocate to a better country to assist me in this endeavor.
I am asking you to help me forward this money to a person who will look after me and my family.
I have never been to Africa before and I have never met a foreigner before. I am quite afraid of death but I am asking you to help me. I am asking for your assistance because I am not the only foreigner in my family that has died in the pogrom. I am asking for your acceptance to come to my room to help me move to a better country where I can have more children.
I am looking forward to hearing from you. Please be assured that this letter is for your personal benefit. I shall be contacting you accordingly to confirm your acceptance to come to our room.
Sincerely yours,
SINCAGIA DEVELOPMENT
