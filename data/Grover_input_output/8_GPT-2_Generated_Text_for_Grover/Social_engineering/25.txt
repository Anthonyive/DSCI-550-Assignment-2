The dollar has a huge market share in the Asia-Pacific, which poses a huge risk to many business partners and the government of the Korean republic. The dollar is the only reliable medium of exchange in Asia-Pacific. The dollar is also the only reliable medium of transfer between the governments of a country and the people of a country, which poses a huge risk to foreign investment and investment.
We want to stand as the first and only Asian country to use the dollar as the reserve currency of the Government of Korea.
The USD is the only guarantee a business partner of the government of the Republic of Korea will have of the security of the dollar.
We have made our position clear to you.
This is why I am asking for your assistance to assist us in securing a reliable, trustworthy and secure funds transfer between both Government of Korea and the people of the Republic of Korea.
I have a lot of construction projects to complete and I don't know why the Government of Korea doesn't want me. I don't want to lose my business partner, and I don't want my business partner to go under.
I want a reliable and trustworthy business partner that will use the USD to invest and invest in my country.
With your help, we can secure a reliable and secure fund transfer between both Government of Korea and the people of the Republic of Korea.
Sincerely yours,
Mr.Bravo A.Z.
