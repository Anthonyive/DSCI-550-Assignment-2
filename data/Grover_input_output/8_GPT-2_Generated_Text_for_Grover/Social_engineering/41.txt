This should be a very good surprise to you. I have no doubt in my mind that you will be delighted to know that I am the owner of the business. I am Mr. Michael L. Kincaid, a very prosperous merchant in France. I am taking the name of this merchant from a material source in France, and this merchant, who worked for the late Mr. Charles Littlain, is very rich. He died in the year 2000. I am very sorry for what I have done to your family, and I want you to know that I have decided to give this business to you as a surprise to you.
My family were in the war for American independence in 1868. I was the son of a great merchant, Sir William Kincaid. Sir William died in a plane crash in the year 2000. Sir William was a merchant in Ivory Coast and Ivory Coast. The money was deposited in a private bank in London. Sir William was in exile in Ivory Coast for years before he was found dead by the security forces. I took the name of this merchant from a source and deposited the money in a private bank in London. Sir William was also the father of a very prosperous business partner. I am going to come to declare this business to be a surprise to you. I am Sir Charles C. Williams, a highly respected merchant in Europe. I am in charge of the treasury in the bank outside of London. I inherited the money with my son and we have not been able to totally fund our capital. Sir Charles was a highly successful merchant. I am going to seek your help in securing the release of the money from the security forces. I will not be able to do this with a foreign country, because of the security problems associated with the country, so I will prefer to remain in your country.
I have a very good relationship with Sir Charles who is the president of Liberia. I have a very good understanding of both of them, and I have no doubt in my mind that you will be pleased to know that I am the only surviving son of Sir Charles. I have decided to donate the money to charity to worthy charity organizations in your country, so that they can assist me in the execution of my purpose.
