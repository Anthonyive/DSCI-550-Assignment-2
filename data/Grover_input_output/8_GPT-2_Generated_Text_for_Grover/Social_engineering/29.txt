On the day of the first draft of the TPP by the international trade body which the US has all but declared war on, we were told by the US Foreign Ministry that the only way to deal with this crisis is to hold a Security Council vote to approve the deal, which will then be decided by the Security Council, which will then proceed to the next step. This is why the US Embassy was so concerned about the fate of the US Government.
Our embassy was contacted by the US Embassy in Nigeria for assistance in the screening of consignment and we were told that the consignment contained US$500.000,000.00 (US$2.5Million.00) which was paid back to Nigeria for the consignment in our country. The consignment was not destroyed, but the funds were misused by the US Government which then deposited in a foreign country where it has accumulated since the war with Nigeria.
All the consignment and the consignment are in the custody of the US Government and they are currently being worked on by the US Government in search of an American partner.
All the consignment has been handed over to the US Government to be released to the next of kin for possible transfer to Africa where we can have a child.
Therefore, we are afraid that the country will be destroyed.
Our hope should be that this consignment will not be used by the US Government again, this is why we are asking for your assistance in the hope that the consignment will be released to you for future investment and investment purposes as it has been proved by our research that the consignment is safe and sound.
Please not to delay us, we know that you are ready to assist us.
Please don't hesitate to contact us through our official email address here:

Thanks and greetings to all the consignors.
Yours faithfully,
President
