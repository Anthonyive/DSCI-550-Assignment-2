I am a 24-year-old person who has worked in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria for over 35 years. My father, a major oil magnate in Africa, died in a plane crash in Nigeria in late 2002. My father was the president of the country for two terms before he was assassinated by the hands of the rebels in 2003. Upon his death I met with the top oil companies in the world (ROK Oil Company, BASF, BASF Europe, and others) and they agreed to invest in a company in Nigeria that will invest in oil and gas. I was in charge of the deal through the chairman of the company and the president of the company. The deal was executed in secret, with the support of a secret political family that was involved in the war in 2003 in whose name were my elder brother, the late President of Nigeria.
The oil companies in Nigeria, including ROK Oil Company and the major oil companies in Africa, agreed to invest in oil and gas production in Nigeria for us to be more profitable and invest in our country's oil resources.
I have now made the decision of investing in Nigeria for a better life for myself and my family. I am staying in Ghana, trying to get some money for my family. I have no other relatives in the oil or gas industry in Nigeria.
I want to serve the interests of the people of Nigeria. This deal was very good for both of us as we were able to get some of the oil and gas from the oil companies in Africa and we managed to get some of the oil and gas from other oil and gas companies in Africa.
I am making this arrangement because I do not know how to make this transaction because of the war in 2003 in my country, which resulted in my father's death, which is why I decided to invest in Nigeria for our future self-preservation.
Before the war, I did not know what to do with money. I did not know that I could become a poor man and only carried out a few of the often given expenses of my life.
I did not know that I could get some younger people to help me out as I am not interested in the money or the fate of the world. I could not understand why people did not want to help me out as I am not rich enough to be the next of kin. I have been very fortunate to have been able to have a good personal relationship with the rich people in Nigeria.
I have always been honest with myself and I have tried to do my best to include all the information I can about this transaction in my contract. I have not been able to come to an agreement on what I would be investing in Nigeria for the benefit of my family and I am afraid of the result as I do not know how or why I will be invested in Nigeria.
I have decided to invest in Nigeria for the survival of my family, as I have no other relatives in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. I have come to understand that the purpose of this transaction is to help the poor to receive assistance from the rich in Africa before they die.
Before this war, I did not know how to make this transaction. I did not know that I could become a poor man and only carried out a few of the often given expenses of my life. I did not know that I could become a poor man and only carry out a few of the often given expenses of my life. I did not know that I could become rich without a lot of money.
I am now in a position where I have no other relatives in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. I do not have any children and my only son and I have no money. I have only been travelling to Africa for the purpose of helping my family and I will not be able to come to an agreement on what I will invest in Nigeria for the benefit of my family and I am afraid of the result as I do not know how or why I will be invested in Nigeria. I have no other relatives in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria.
My son is still in a coma and I am in a state of shock as I have nothing to do. My only hope is that I can help him out as I have shown my true faith in Christ.
I had no problem investing money in Nigeria because my son is in a very good condition and I have nothing to hide. I have nothing else to hide as I have nothing to hide.
I have no problem getting help from the rich countries in Africa where I worked. I have not been able to come to an agreement on what I will be investing in Nigeria for the benefit of my family. I am afraid that the result of this transaction will be a war between the rich and the poor, which will be the death of my family and one of my brothers.
I do not know what to do with the money as I do not know what to do with it. I do not know that my son will be able to escape the clutches
