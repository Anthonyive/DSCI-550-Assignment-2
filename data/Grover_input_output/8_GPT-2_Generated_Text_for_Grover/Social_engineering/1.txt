The GAO has made this request after a confidential telephone and fax correspondence was sent to us by a business associate of the late President Robert Mugabe.
Mr. Robert Mugabe, in a letter to the treasurer of the Bank of Zimbabwe, stated,
"You can not trust the Government of the late President Robert Mugabe. You do not know what he wants you to do, you do not know what he wants you to do, and you do not know what he wants you to do. I am afraid that this letter will prove to be a disaster for the Government of the late President Robert Mugabe.
I am afraid that this Government of the late President Robert Mugabe will not be able to stand by as they try to hide behind the very existence of his Government.
I do not know what country this Government belongs to but I know that they are going to have to deal with this problem head on. I have decided to bring this letter to you because I am afraid they are going to treat this letter as a political letter. I am afraid that this letter will be used to justify and further their desperate plans to take over the Government of the late President Robert Mugabe.
I have decided to bring this letter to you because I know that this Government will be a very big problem for the Government at large, so this is why I am so interested in you, because I know that this Government is going to have to deal with this problem head on. I am afraid that this Government can not stand by as this Government tries to take over the Government of the late President Robert Mugabe.
I am sure that one day, you will be very glad to know that this Government is going to be under absolute control in this country. This is why I am asking you to come to my country, so that we can discuss this matter. I want you to know that I am not afraid of death because I know that this Government is going to deal with this problem head on.
I am convinced that this Government is going to be able to deal with this problem head on without any corrupt people. I am sure that this Government will not want any foreigner or foreigner to come to their country, so that they can claim their rights as citizens of this Country.
I am no doctor, so I am not going to give you all the details of how I got here. But I am going to give you a very good idea of the situation of this Government, which is going to be very hard facing.
