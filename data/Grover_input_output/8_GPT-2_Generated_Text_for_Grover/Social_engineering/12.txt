2. Should I also want to keep my iShares of this business at the same level as the fees that you pay out to the beneficiary?
3. If you are the beneficiary of the business, it would be very important to have a percentage share of your money. This percentage is based on the percentage of the total sum that you can release to the beneficiary.
4. I am looking for people who can assist me with this transaction. I have always been a business owner and I am confident that this transaction will be profitable for both of us.
5. Can you please give me your contact so that I can contact you by e-mail so that we can discuss?
Thanks and regards,
