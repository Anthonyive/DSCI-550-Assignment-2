This is the first in a series of posts on how to manage accounts in EMEA (Eligible for Deposit).
This is an investment guide for you to help you manage your account.
My name is Charles Leung. I am the owner of the company EMEA (Eligible for Deposit) in Indonesia. I am a former Congressman and Chairman of the Committee on the Government of the President.
This was before the current crisis in South Africa. My Government was in power, but the past has not ended.
I am not claiming any of this as my own. I am simply trading this information for the betterment of the people of South Africa.
However, I am looking forward to investing this investment in your country. This will give you the confidence and security you need to take on the role as President of the Republic of South Africa.
I am still waiting for your views. Please reply as soon as possible.
I hope to hear from you soon enough.
Regards,
Mrs.Hannah Bussain

Dear Friend,
I am Mrs.Lauren L. South Africa, a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I was born in the former Yugoslavia. I moved to South Africa in the late 1970's with my brother in search of a better life.
I was later married to a South African diplomat named Olaf Leku, who was the first African to issue an inheritance from a white family.
I married the late Olaf to a South African diplomat named Adeel Basil who worked for the president of the African Union of Democratic Forces (ANC), DRC (African Union of Democratic Forces).
He died in our house in the early 2000's. I have only one child, who in the process of development is in need of a child procreation partner.
I am still in the process of moving to a safe and prosperous country but I have no hope of surviving with my family and I am not sure if I will be able to move again. I am not sure if my life will be any better after this fate. I am not going to give up on the family I have inherited.
Please, I will be very glad if you can give me some information to help me keep this job. I will give you a brief description of the investment which will be very important to you.
I am the eldest son of the late President Olaf Leku who died in the early 2000's. I am still living in South Africa.
My mother was the first African to issue an inheritance from a white family. She and my father were killed by the rebels in the late late 1990's.
I have only one child, who in the process of development is in need of a child procreation partner.
I am still in the process of re-marrying with this family.
Please, I will be glad to give you some information which will enable me to keep this family in very good health.
I will be very glad to give you your phone numbers and fax numbers now that you have a reliable telephone network to call for help.
