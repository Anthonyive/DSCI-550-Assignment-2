This is a massive thank you to all the people of the world for the support and support they have given. I want to sincerely apologize for my delay in sending you this letter so that I may be able to assist you as I am unable to travel to Europe for the purpose hence the delay in sending you this letter. I will also like you to send me some documents you will need as you are the problem and I will also like you to tell me your position on the issue.
I would also like to inform you that my husband is a highly respected late director of security and finance company in the US with a total net worth of US$10.7 Billion dollars, that was established by the late Sir James Kennedy. Sir James was a financial pioneer and the first president of the United Kingdom. He made a lot of money by investing in the British interest in oil and diamonds. Sir James died in a plane crash on 14th November, 1969 and while on the plane he left a huge sum of money in a box in a special vault in the security company. I was able to contact Sir James and he assured me that it was in the safe and that Sir James was not dead at the time. I am not afraid of death, I am not afraid of death. All I know is that I am going to be alone in this situation.
Sir James was a highly respected individual who took the position of director of security in the Security Company of the Royal Bank of Scotland. He died on 5th December, 2001 in a plane crash in a foreign country.

Dear Sir,
I am Sir David Morrison, a late director of security and finance company in the US. I arrived in London on a business trip and discovered that I am Mrs. Mary Kelly, a widow of a late Sir David Morrison, who was the first son of the late Sir David Morrison, the late Sir David Morrison. My husband was the first son of Sir David Morrison, the late Sir David Morrison, who was the late Sir David Morrison. Sir David Morrison died from complications of diabetes and cancer. After a brief illness, Sir David died from an overdose of morphine and was poisoned by his employers. I was poisoned by my boss who also died from a stroke of an unknown cause.
I am looking forward to your urgent reply as soon as possible. I would like to know the type of documents you will seek and the money I will want to invest in you. I want you to know that my husband died with a huge amount of money in a box in a special vault in a security company in England. I am going to use this money to invest in myself as my son. I am going to invest this money in any of the above mentioned properties. I am going to make full use of all my assets and I intend to cover all expenses.
1)Existing
2)Borrowing
3)Accounting
4)Investment in the above mentioned properties.
I will like to share this investment with you because I am a widower of Sir David Morrison who died in a plane crash in Japan on 15th November, 2001. I found out about this death through the contact of some of my late husband's relatives. I have no doubt that I will be the next of kin to Sir David Morrison, since his death I am going to invest the money in you and my son.
I have been advised by some of my colleagues and relatives that we have to come by land, sea or air and bring back the money before the money is deposited with the security company. I have also been advised by my good doctor that if I do not bring back the money I will be declared dead. I have not been able to bring back the money because of sickness and other causes. I am very ill and I have been confined to bed for a very long time. I am still alive and I have inherited a lot of wealth. I have been well rewarded in the financial world for my efforts and I believe that I am the last of the rich to go to the countries where I am going to invest the money.
This is why I am contacting you because of the fact that my husband died in a plane crash in Japan on 15th November, 2001. I have decided to bring back this money because I am afraid of death. I have also decided to bring back all the other properties under the security company, including the home where the money was deposited.
I have decided to invest this money in any of the above mentioned properties under your assurance. I have decided to invest this money in any of the above mentioned properties as the risk of the deal is very high for me.
