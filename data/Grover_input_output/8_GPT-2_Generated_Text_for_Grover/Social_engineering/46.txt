Easter is coming!
This family will be blessed as the first to receive the Holy Communion, which is the final and absolute blessing of God.
This is why I have decided to give you as the beneficiary of this special inheritance to facilitate the development of this family as a Christian and a Muslim.
This is the reason why I am going to give you this special inheritance.
I want to maintain peace and happiness in your life as I will not give you away for any reason.
This will not only guarantee you your happiness, but also the happiness of all the family as we shall have a son, daughter, son-in-law and a son-in-law in your life.
This is why I am contacting you to immediately assist me in making this family as divinely directed.
I want you to be amenable to my proposal as I have said before that this is not a Christian family.
I have only just concluded the transaction with you as I am in no way seeking any favour from you, so I have no intention of making any surprise or surprise to you.
I want you to be the one to guide me through this transaction as I will be ready to give you the funds and the identity of the beneficiary of this special inheritance.
I will give you as much information as I can concerning the nature of the money, the nature of the fund and the nature of the family to enable you to be the guide.
Please do not hesitate to contact me via your real name and telephone and fax numbers as I will be glad to assist you as I am not friends with any of my relatives.
