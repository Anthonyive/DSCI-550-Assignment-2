On the day of the release of the first draft of the new contract, there was immediate concern in the industry about the effect of the move on the investment. I have decided to take a close look at the documents that are currently on file in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. I have found that the documents contain a clause that states:

THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT SHALL BE REMOVED FOR THE MEETING OF THE PRESIDENT, THE SECURITY OFFICER AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL OFFICIANS. AND THE SUCH SUCCESS WILL BE REMOVED FOR MEETING.
This situation has not been going on for some time. I have been in contact with my partner from the Security firm that I worked for in Europe. As soon as we meet, he will instruct me to give you the details of all the things that have been done and the release date of the documents. I have also decided to give you a deposit guarantee that will enable you to invest in the security firm for the future.
If this proposal can be agreed and agreed upon, we will be glad to discuss the details of this arrangement in the private life of our joint partner, the security firm manager, and I will be glad to share the sum of US$2.5Million (Eighteen Million US Dollars) with the security firm manager.
Since you are a risk-free person, I have decided to keep you in suspense as to what will happen to this money. In the event that you are not ready to give the details of the transaction, I will be willing to share your response with me to enable me to discuss it with you better.

I am a 31 year old scientist with a family in India residing in Europe. My family was once a prosperous agriculture family in India. I lost my father and my mother to the arms and ammunition of the British government. After my father was killed in the attack on my father's farm in 1948, I had no idea where I was going. I got a job as a labourer and I worked a day in a day for the British Government.I worked for the Security Company for two years before I was finally conscripted into India as a refugee which resulted in my mother's passing. Now I am trying to escape the country,but my country is in disarray. I have only one son left and my only hope is that he will be my son. I am trying to relocate to Europe where my family will have a prosperous, prosperous life.
