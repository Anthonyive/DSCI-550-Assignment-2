I have been doing this blog for over 12 years now. I am quite a polyamorist. I am seeking for a devoted husband and a devoted husband to share this love of ours. I have a son who is a virgin and I am looking forward to discuss this with the Blessed One.
I am seeking for your assistance in this regard. Before we proceed, I want to establish some trust between us. I am seeking for a husband of some authority in charge of the fund. I am looking forward to seek your reply.
Thanks and God bless you as you assist me.
Best Regards,
Sara
DEAR FRIEND,
I am not using your name. I am a married man who is seeking for a reliable and devoted husband.
I am looking for a man who will take me to Utah and I will give you my full name, age, and account number, I will give you the particulars of all the necessary papers and you will also be required to furnish me with all necessary documents.
Before we proceed, I want to give some thanks to the Blessed One for whom I am seeking to serve. I am humbled by your help.
I am seeking for a husband who will deal the sordid affairs of his husband. He will not hesitate to kill or maim him. He will not hesitate to commit the  
secret of the Faith to the bosom of the Lord. He will not hesitate to aid in the execution of the holy Work. He will always stand firm as a husband.
My name is Taylor T. Shrewsbury. I am married to a late Sir Robert Shrewsbury who is the president of the Catholic Federal Republic of India.
The late Sir Robert Shrewsbury was a highly educated, highly respected, and highly successful business man who was involved in some major financial transactions and a major investment deal in Kuwait. He died in the middle of the night in a hotel in Kuwait.
I am not aware of any other person or organization that has been so highly valued in the financial capital of the world. I am only a child of Sir Robert Shrewsbury and in fact I inherited this fortune from my late father. It was a time of great upheaval in the world economy.
I was a married person for one which lasted for more than 20 years. I have lived in complete ignorance of the 
history and current affairs of the world. I have not seen a trace of my husband. My doctor told me that my condition was very bad. I was in a very bad condition.
I was diagnosed with cancer of the inner breast. During my stay in Kuwait I was diagnosed with cancer of the lymphatic system. I was in this condition for over 10 years.
It was at this time that I decided to enter into a partnership with Sir Robert Shrewsbury. I decided to seek for a husband who will deal the sordid affairs of his husband. I am humbled by your assistance.
