JOHANNESBURG -- The European Union and South Korea have said they will still cooperate with South Korean intelligence services to develop a joint Internet website in South Korea.
The United States, South Korea and Japan, along with the European Union and South Korea, have also expressed strong support for the idea.
The United States has said that it will not accept the proposal by the South Korean intelligence services, which is high on the list of areas where it is concerned.
It has also said that the South Korean intelligence services have been more than willing to invest in this project, which they believe will benefit South Korea.
The United Nations Security Council has approved a resolution that condemns the plan.
The proposal is in the highest level of the Security Council after South Korea declared that the information gathered on the Internet will not be used for any military purposes and that the Internet will be used for political purposes.
The United Nations Security Council has called for an international inspection and verification of the project.
It has also asked for South Korea to be involved in the project.
