I got this package from my maharashtra secretary. He sent me a box of 100B & 60B with the address & the address of all the foreign companies involved in the transaction.
He told me that the box is now 100B & 60B in total. I was immediately told that I should file a claim with the government of India for the  money which is all I need to give to the foreign companies.
I'm now looking for a lawyer with experience in this area. I am looking for a person who can understand the situation and who can handle the situation with the utmost respect and dignity and would appreciate it if you could assist me.
I have received your letter and am ready to assist you in this matter. I will be forwarding you the following communication as soon as I can.
