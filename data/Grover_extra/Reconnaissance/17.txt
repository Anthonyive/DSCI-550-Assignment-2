The current state of the security of the Internet and of the Internet's security is being challenged by the United States Government. A group of high-level officials from various government agencies in the United States are presently taking over the line of communication and communication equipment. The government is seeking to continue the operations of the existing security network to ensure its security in the use and distribution of such equipment.

This is because the security of the Internet is presently endangered by the government.

Therefore, we expect that this project will be transferred into the hands of a foreign company.
This project will be managed by the security company in charge of the project.
When the project is completed, all of the equipment will be transferred to the United States Government.
The Government of the United States is also seeking a foreign partner to help us put the project into operation. We are seeking your assistance in this regard.
The National Security Company of America, is a company of the Ministry of Information and Information Technology (MSIT) of the deceased Ministry of Information Technology, General Staff.
The development that was undertaken to secure the original network of communication and communication equipment from the government for use on international business were all supported by the Ministry. The Ministry has managed to secure the network and the equipment, but much remains to be done.
The project has been officially approved by the Ministry for use in the development of the network and the equipment. It is still in the process of being prepared for execution.
