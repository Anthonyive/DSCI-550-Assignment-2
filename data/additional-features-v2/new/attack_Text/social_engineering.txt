GOOD DAY TO YOU
FROM HIS ROYAL MAJESTY (HRM) CROWN RULER OF ELEME KINGDOM 
CHIEF DANIEL ELEME, PHD, EZE 1 OF ELEME.E-MAIL 
ADDRESS:obong_715@epatra.com  
ATTENTION:PRESIDENT,CEO Sir/ Madam. 
This letter might surprise you because we have met
neither in person nor by correspondence. But I believe
it is one day that you got to know somebody either in
physical or through correspondence. 
I got your contact through discreet inquiry from the
chambers of commerce and industry of your country on
the net, you and your organization were revealed as
being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one
has no doubt in your ability to handle a financialbusiness transaction. 
However, I am the first son of His Royal
majesty,Obong.D. Eleme , and the traditional Ruler of
Eleme Province in the oil producing area of River
State of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in
respect of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United
State Dollars), which I inherited, from my latefather. 
This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my
father as compensation by the oil firms located in our
area as a result of oil presence on our land, which
hamper agriculture, which is our major source oflivelihood. 
Unfortunately my father died from protracted
diabetes.But before his death he called my attention
and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two
boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary
status. The lodgment security code number was also
revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a
reliable business partner abroad, that will assist me
in investing the money in a lucrative business as a
result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is
the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move
this money from the security firm to any Country of
your choice for investment purpose. 
So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so
that the funds can be moved in your name and
particulars to any Country of your choice where it
will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had
intimated the security firm personnel that the
beneficiary of the box is his foreign partner whose
particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. 
But I will guide you Accordingly. As soon as the funds
reach, I will then come over to meet you in person, so
that we can discuss physically on investment
potentials. Based on this assistance my Family and I
have unanimously decided to give you 30% of the total
money, 5% for Charity home, 10% for expenses, which
may arise during this transaction, Fax and phone bills
inclusive. The balance of 55% you will invest andmanaged for my Family. 
I hereby guarantee you that this is not government
money, it is not drug money and it is not money from
arms deal. Though you have to maintain high degree of
confidentiality on this matter. I will give more
details about the proceedings of this transaction as
soon as I receive your favorable reply. 
Please reply to my Email Address:obong_715@epatra.com
I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous
relationship between my family and your family. 
Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interested,
kindly inform me immediately so that I will look foranother contact. 
I am waiting for your quick response. 
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR TEMI JOHNSON of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share
(percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and GodBless.

safe-keeping. This money was lodged in security vaults
/ boxes and labelled as personal belongings and as such
the security company does not know the true content of
the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used
for his political campaign. Because I was his family
Attorney as such he confided in me with the
relevant document papers relating to this deposit
before he died of cardiac arrest.
As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement
with an offshore Security Company to move this money as
a consignment through diplomatic means to their
offshore affiliated office where you will be required
to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide
beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that
this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it
does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund.

We were then given this money privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping.

BEST REGARDS, 
MRS M. SESE SEKO Inheritance Claim(Urgent Response)
ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTOR
I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal Ministries in lagos-Nigeria. 
During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity. 
I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.
It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. 
I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. 
If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via Fax:234-1-7597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. I expect your urgent response. 
Regards,
David.

KINDEST ATTENTION,
PLEASE PERMIT ME TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE IN SO INFORMAL A MANNER.
THIS IS NECESSITATED BY MY URGENT NEED TO REACH A DEPENDABLE AND
TRUSTWORTHY FOREIGN PARTNER. THIS REQUEST MAY SEEM STRANGE AND
UNSOLICITED BUT I CRAVE YOUR INDULGENCE AND PRAY THAT YOU TAKE MY
REQUEST VERY SERIOUS.
I AM MR PETER WILLIAMS, A REKNOWNED BUSINESSMAN IN ONE OF THE
REBEL-HELD TOWNS, BOUAKE (ONE OF THE WAR ZONES IN IVORY COAST)
I RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE WHO DESCRIBED YOUR
COUNTRY AS BEING ECONOMICALLY CONDUCIVE FOR INVESTMENT
AND HER PEOPLE AS TRANSPARENT AND TRUSTWORTHY TO ENGAGING BUSINESS
WHICH MADE ME TO WRITE YOU. AS YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW
AND TO MAKE YOU LESS CURIOUS,I GOT YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS FROM AN
INTERNET SITE THAT PORTRAYED YOU (YOUR ESTABLISHMENT) IN GOOD
LIGHT.
ON THE 17TH OF SEPTEMBER 2002. THE REBEL LEADERS, UNTIL THEN WERE
LOYAL SOLDIERS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT LAURENT GBAGBO 
CONTACTED ME IN MY OFFICE WITH THE BUSINESS OF IMPORTATION OF
ARMOURIES. WITHOUT THE PREMONITION OF WAR, I ACCEPTED THE JOB. THE
SOLDIERS PAID ME THE SUM OF TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$ 20.5) ON THE SPOT AND TOLD ME TO EXPEDITE
ACTION. SINCE I AM NOT INTO IMPORTATION OF ARMUNITIONS AND BECAUSE OF
THE URGENCY, I IMMEDIATELY STARTED MAKING SEVERAL CONTACTS WITH
BUSINESSMEN ACROSS THE GLOBE.
TWO DAYS LATER, HEAVY FIGHTING BROKE UP IN CENTRAL BAOUKE AND
KORHOGO, EVERYWHERE WAS IN DISSARRAY AND I LOST EVERYTHING THAT TOOK
ME SO MANY YEARS TO ACQUIRE. I HAVE NO OPTION THAN TO DO AWAY WITH
THE US$20.5M.
MY WIFE AND I QUICKLY MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A RED CROSS RELIEF
WORKER WHO USED HIS OFFICIAL VAN TO MOVE THIS MONEY TO ABIDJAN,
ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE REAL CONTENT OF THE BOX.  PRESENTLY,
THIS FUND HAS BEEN DEPOSITED WITH A SAFE RELIABLE SECURITY COMPANY IN
ABIDJAN WHERE I AM HIDING FROM THE REBEL WHO DECLEARED ME WANTED. I
DO NOT WANT TO INVEST THIS MONEY IN ABIDJAN DUE TO UNFAVORABLE
ECONOMIC CLIMATE.  AS A RESULT, I KEPT THE MONEY IN A CUSTOM BONDED
WAREHOUSE WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY.  SO THAT I CAN NOT LAY MY HANDS

YOURS FAITHFULLY,
MR PETER WILLIAMSBusiness Cooperation ( Inheritance Claim)
From: Mr.Daniel Osondu
Fax: Number +23417597019 
Dear Sir,
I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Daniel Osondu an auditor at one of the Banks in lagos-Nigeria. 
During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $18.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Manfred Becker, a foreigner who died in a crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted our curiosity. 
I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the Ministry that he executed the contract for and also with our Bank. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.
It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Thomas Danababa , that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. 
I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in 
course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via my confidential fax number +23417597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. 
I expect your urgent response.

Dear Friend,
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent
need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray
that you view it seriously. My name is MR WILLIAMS DANIEL of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the
close aides to the former President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. But when President Kabila was killed in a
bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately 
decided to divert the fund into a private security
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security
of the said amount is presently being threatened here
following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col.
Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)
a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from
our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent
Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy
foreign partner who can assist us to move this money
out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under
Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe
in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic
Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not
pass through normal custom/airport screening and
clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed
good friends (western countries) who suddenly became
hostile to those of us who worked with the late
President Kabila, immediately after his son took
office. Though we have neither seen nor met each
other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and
convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this
transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The
said money is a state fund and therefore requires a
total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email
address above with your telephone, fax number and
personal information to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share
(percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You
to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter
extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision,
while I await your prompt response. Thank you and
GodBless.

Attn.:  The President/CEO
I am  Dr. (Mrs.) Maryam Abacha, wife to the late
Nigeria Head of State - General Sani Abacha. I am
proposing this business to you because we could be of
great assistance to each other, likewise developing a
cordial business relatinship.
I currently have within my reach the sum of Twenty-Five
Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars 
(US$25,600,000:00)cash which I intend to 
use for investment purpose specifically in your country. 
This money came as a result of a pay back contract 
deal between my late husband and a Russian firm 
on our country's Multi-billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. 
The Russian partners returned my husband's share of
US$25.6 million after his death and lodged it with my
husband's security firm in Nigeria of which I am adirector.
Right now, the new civilian government has revoked our
licenses that allow us to own a financial and oil
company. 
In view of this, I acted very fast to
withdraw the US$25.6 million from the company's vault
well preserved and packaged in trunk boxes and
deposited it in  ECOWAS Security Bank. I have since
declared our  security company bankrupt. No record 
ever  existed concerning the money neither is the
money traceable by the government because there is no
document showing that we received the money from the
Russians.
Due to the current situation in the country concerning
the government attitude towards my family, it has
become quite impossible for me to make use of the
money within, thus I seek your assistance to move the
money out of this country. On your consent, I shall
expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that
your assistance is needed to transfer this fund.
Your urgent response is highly needed.  All
correspondences must be channeled to our legal adviser
Leonard Obi Esq  through  his direct Tel. No:
234-1-4705964. I must also use this opportunity to
implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep
this transaction a confidential issue. You can also
contact me directly on  my secret  telephone:-234-1-4705964
if there is need.
Thanks and God bless you.

First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of it�s nature as being very CONFIDENTIAL. 
I am a Senior Manager with a commercial bank . I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign country.
THE PREPOSITION
The late  JERRY ADAMS a Foreigner and an oil merchant / contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria until his death four years ago in a plane crash, banked with us  and had a closing balance of USD10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars).
The bank now unquestionably expect it to be claimed by JERRY ADAMS� next of kin. Efforts have been made by my bank to get in touch with any of the ADAMS� Family but to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate JERRY ADAMS� next of kin (NOK) that the management under the influence of our Executive Director has agreed that since the incident occurred in 1997 and has left the fund dormant and devalued, we should transfer the fund overseas and utilize it either on stock exchange market or personal business interest.
Your role is very important as the fund when concluded on transfer would be justifiably presented as having been remitted to JERRY ADAMS� next of kin (NOK)  . Your interest will be protected as unnecessary documentation will be avoided. Note that all modalities necessary for execution of the business have been perfected. 
The money will be shared equally i.e 50% for you 50% for us, expenses too will be shared equally .
It is a risk-free deal.

Dear Sir,
I am sending you this confidential email after searching through the Internet I passionate appeal to you for assistance. Many stories might be emanating from my country Nigeria that will cast some aspersions of doubt in your mind regarding this assistance I require from you.
In the light of this, I am Mr. Mohammed Abacha, son of the late General Sanni Abacha the former military head of state of Nigeria. I have been in detention in the last four years following the death of my father for charges of State organized murder and corrupt practices. I have just been released by the Supreme Court a fourth night ago after the president brokered a deal with my family regarding my freedom. Having made my self-known, I wish to emphasize that I need your assistance in the investment of some $35.5 Million USD of my family fund that have been held in a security company in Holland Amsterdam.
Because of the tragic death of my father culminating to my prolonged detention, my mother was too devastated to take charge of all the family estate. Now that I have regained my freedom, I am soliciting for your assistance in the receipt of the fund from the security company in Holland for investment in viable areas of business interest under your prudent management.
Conclusively, I have decided to offer you 20%of the total sum for your assistance, while 5% will be for whatever expenses that will be incurred while 75% is to be used in buying shares and franchise from companies in your country and maybe buy houses in your country subsequent to our free movement by the Nigerian Government.
If this proposal appeals to your positive response, please send to me immediately your contact address and telephone/fax numbers to enable me forward it to the security company in Holland.
My contact person at the security company will direct and guide you accordingly. Please treat this with strict confidentiality.
Yours faithfully,

However,I am the first son of his Royal Majesty, Iginawari Nweke Adisaraki III  and the traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 28,000,000.00 (Twenty eight million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late father. This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my father as compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But before his he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary status. The lodgment Security Code Number was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria.
So this is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment purposes.  So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the funds can be moved in your name and particulars to any country of your choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. 
But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss physically on Investment entials.Based on this instance I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% of the total money and annual 5% of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years.

My dear Friend, 
I am highly compelled upon strict recommendation, to write you this very 
urgent and confidential letter.I do hope my letter will not embarrass you
since I had no previous correspondence with you.I hope this mail will not 
come to you as a surprise.
I am sending this proposal with due sense of humanity, responsibility and
with few awareness that you will give it a sympathetic attention. I regree
t the inconvenience it may cause you base on the condition that we have not 
met before. 
I am Mrs. Salatu Mustapha, the wife of Al Mustapha, personal assistant to the Late head of state of Federal Republic of Nigeria - General Sani Abacha.I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other like wise developing a cordial relationship.
My husband along with the head of state and top officials of their past administration has been accused of looting several Billion United States 
Dollars from the Nigeria Government. The current attitude of the present government towards my family has indeed made life quite unbearable for us.
Fortunately, Al Mustapha my Husband has Six million and eight hundred thousa
nd United States Dollars(US$6.8 million) cash, which he intended to use for investment purposes overseas. This money is kept in a private security company. 
This money was deposited for safe keeping in the security vault of a freighting agency here by my husband preparotry to being air lifted abroad 
for investment purposes before his arrest leaving a clause that it could only be claimed by an expertriate partner. It is only my husband and myself that know where the money is kept. 
Due to the current situation in the country concerning government�s vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer this money out of Nigeria for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband.
Note that my family is currently being probed by this present government for alleged involvement in misappropriation of public funds during their regime.Towards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members from traveling or carrying out
financial transactions without their 
express permission is in force.
Right now, my husband (Al Mustapha) is under arrest and is being detained in
connection to the above and other activities of his late Boss.
However, I have an arrangement on how to freight this money to you after receiving some assurances from you of the safety our own share and that you 
will only take the commission that we will offer you.
This money personally belongs to my husband and he intends that it still 
be used for investment. No record ever existed concerning this money, nei
ther is the money traceable by the government because there
is no Documentation concerning the funds in the Federal Treasury. 
The freighting company to be used has now been introduced to me and as so
on as we recieve your readiness to assist us recieve this fund we shall 
formalize the deposit documents in your name and reach an agreement with
them to air lift the consignment for your pick up.
Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, we 
propose a commission of 15%(Fifteen Percent) of the total sum to you for 
the expected services and assistance. While 5% is mapped out
for miscellaneous expenses.
On your positive consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to 
enable us discuss about this.Your urgent response is highly needed. I must 
use this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost indulgence to keep 
this matter extraordinarily confidential, while I await your prompt response.

I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by  President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and properties then decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt,and the farmlands and machines seized; yet the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.
To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 15% of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 25% share for possible help on investing in any rentable sector.

Dear Sir,/Madam
I am LADY SWEETIE AMINA USMAN, Bank Manager of Zenith
International Bank of Nigeria,Adeola Odeku Branch,Lagos . I have urgent and
very
confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American Oil 
consultant/contractor
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a
numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at
US$35,000,000.00 (Thirty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon
maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got
no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further
investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his
official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This
sum of US$35,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foriegner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the
fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some
corrupt government officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately
your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the
necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next
of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and
letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.
We would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of
kin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mr. Barry Kelly to travel and
claim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe or sub-regional
African country which is used by my bank as an offshore clearing house
to the bank.The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio
of 60% for me and 40% for you.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch
Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via
the private email address below. Upon your response,I shall then provide
you with more details and relevant documents that will help you
understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I
shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please
furnish me with your telephone and fax numbers for easier and faster
communication. Awaiting your urgent reply via my 
email:ami44000@netzero.net
Thanks and regards,
SWEETIE AMINA USMAN

I am Mr. John Coleman and my sister is Miss Rose Coleman, we are the children of late Chief Paul Coleman from Sierra Leone. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our cash of twenty one Million Dollars ($21,000.000.00) now in the custody of a private Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as family valuables by my late father as a matter of fact the company does not know the content as money, although my father made them to under stand that the boxes belongs to his foreign partner.
Source of the money:
My late father Chief Paul Coleman , a native of Mende District in the Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales.
Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to HOLLAND NETHERLAND, with the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with a security firm in Europe through the aid
of U.N evacuation team.
During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including other top Government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her early this year . Now my 18 years old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any relation,we are nowlike refugees and orphans.
Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security Firm To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways.
1. to assist me claim this boxes from the security Firm as our beneficiary
2. to transfer this money (USD$21M) in your name to your country
3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our
behalf in your country and you, our Adviser/ Manager
For your assistance, I have agreed with my younger sister that 15% of the total amount will be for your effort and another 5 % to cover all the expenses that may incur during the business transaction, Last, I urge you to keep this transaction strictly confidential as no one knows our where about.
Please as you show your willingness, Forward to us your full name, address and Tel/ Fax numbers, to me via my private email address as indicated bellow,(rosecolemen@netscape.net) this is for security reasons as i will only be accessing my private email earnestly awaiting your response.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
My Dear Friend,
I am highly compelled upon strict recommendation, to write you this very
urgent and confidential letter.I do hope my letter will not embarrass you since I had no previous correspondence with you.I hope this mail will not come to you as a surprise.
I am sending this proposal with due sense of humanity, responsibility and with few awareness that you will give it a sympathetic attention. I regret to the inconvenience it may cause you base on the condition that we have not met before.
I wish to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you, I am Mrs Mary Iddo Sankoh,the wiife of the former minister of Diamond Mining Corporation in my country Sierra Leone in West Africa,My husband had a bullet shot by the rebels on his way travelling to Lusia a city after Freetown the capital along with my daughter, My daughter died on the spot while the U N peace keeping force rescued my Husband, he was taken to hospital for medical treatment which he later died about three months now.
Fortunately, My Husband has Ten million and Five hundred thousand United States Dollars(US$10.5 million) cash, which he intended to use for investment purposes overseas. This money is kept with private security company in Europe since two years ago. It is only my son and myself that know where the money is kept and has the documents for it.
Due to the current situation in the country concerning government’s vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer the ownership of this fund to you so that you can asisst us to claim it and used for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband. My family is currently being probed by this present government for alleged involvement in misappropriation
of public funds during his regime.
Towards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members from traveling or carrying out financial transactions without their express permission is in force. Right now, my son and myself have concluded plans and decided to  take immediate claim of this fund so that we can use it to better our lives and alliviate our present suffering hence this contact.
However, I have an arrangement on how you can help us to recieve this money after receiving some assurances from you. The money personally belongs to my husband and he intended that it still be used for investment. No record ever existed concerning this money, neither is the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation concerning the funds in the Federal
Treasury.
Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, we propose a commission of 20%(Twenty Percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance. While 5% is mapped out for miscellaneous expenses.
On your positive consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss about
this.Your urgent response is highly needed. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, while I await your prompt response.
Best regards,
MRS. MARY IDDO SANKOH/ABDUL SANKOHCRY FOR HELP
Dear Sir,
Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad
necessitate
this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of
USD21,000.000 (twenty one million  dollars)inherited from my father's
business
reserve.
I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He
became
rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by
President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown
gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white
farmers.
Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and
property then decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and
security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property
our family since our home was burnt,and the farmlands and machines seized;
the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.
To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 15% 
the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 25%
share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture.
There are however some minimal cost involved in securing the release of this
deposit from the present holding company.i do not intend to overburden you
with
these cost.but you must know beforehand that we will be sharing whatever
cost
involved in retrieving this deposit and putting it to beneficial use.
if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed
information. if you do not accept my offer,please in good fate treat with
utmost
confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers to
for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.

regarding the business would then be brought to your knowledge.

Greeting,
This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person 
nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know 
somebody either in physical or through correspondence that iswhy i am now 
in spain making this contart please  do call me on phone becaouse this is
very urgent business. 
I got your contact through some discreet inquire from the chamber of 
commerce and industry,you and your company were revealed as being quite 
astute in private entreprenuership.one has no doubt in your ability to 
handle a financial business transaction. 
However, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty,WIWA DUKE and the 
traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of 
Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 20,000,000.00 
(twenty million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late 
father the money was accumulated from royalties rapid to my father as 
compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil 
presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of 
livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But 
before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged 
some funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary 
status. The lodgment Security Code Number
was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable 
business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a 
lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this 
is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money 
from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment 
purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the 
funds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your 
choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had 
intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is 
his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when 
due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I 
will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss 
physically on Investment potentials. 
Based on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% 
of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may 
arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The 
balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family. 
I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not 
drug money and it is not money from arms deal.
Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this 
matter. I will give you
all proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully 
satisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the 
beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.
Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me 
immediately so that I will look for another contact. 
I am waiting for your quick
response.
Yours faithfully
PRINCE GEORGE DUKEFrom;Mr.Daniel Kargbu and Family,
Lome. Republic of Togo.
My Dear ,
Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.
My name is Mr.Daniel Smith Kargbu , the second son of Retired Major.George Smith Kargbu , of Monrovia Liberia,.At the height of the current political crises in our country,in which the rebel group of the opposition party in our country slain and ripp off the supporters of our president,Mr Charles Taylor,in their efforts to reclaim power in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 6th of July,2003, in their struggle to protect some civilians who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a retired major with our countrys army and a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the civilians by the rebel group in which they force the younger civilians to fight with guns and grenades and in the process loose either their lives or some parts of their body upon refusal !
to take the ammunition for war.I therefore decided to move my mother and my younger sister and brother to the Republic of Togo for refuge,where we presently stay without anything and without any source of livelyhood.
During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death with my elder brother in the night of that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving grown up son of my father,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Republic of Togo finally.And also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money before it is dictated out and blocked by the incoming regime in our country, and also to improve my familys worsening condition at present.
Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;
1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to their office here in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear and accomodate this money for my family .
2. To finally assist us in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years after I must have joined you first.
Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our unexpected bad situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.
Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.
Best Regards,
Mr.Daniel Kargbu and family.Dear Sir,
Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of USD22,000.000 (twenty two million dollars)inherited from my father's business reserve.
I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family.my father was an agriculturist. He became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and property and decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt and the farmlands and machines seized;yet the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.
To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 25% of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 35% share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture.
if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed information. if you do not accept my offer, in good fate treat with utmost confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
DANDLA NGUBEUrgent  Business Proposal.

ASSISTANCE   FOR CHARLES  TAYLOR
I am writing you based on recommendation, trust and confidence.  My name is Mr. David Anderson, one of   Charles Taylor’s personal aids.  I write to solicit your assistance in the investment of a total of US$17,000,000.00 (Seventeen Million United States dollar) belonging to Charles Taylor the former President of Liberia.
This amount is his general savings throughout his tenor in the office as President of Liberia.  But, due to the sanctions from the World Governing body, requesting him to leave the country within a certain period for the forestallment of peace and unity in Liberia, the fund was moved by him out of Monrovia to a neighboring country for safe keeping.  Since we are now in Nigeria seeking asylum, we have no means of reaching the fund unless if Power of Attorney is given to a third party to administer the fund on his behalf.  Thus the need for assistance from you.
The terms and condition of this understanding is negotiable and very attractive.  If you are interested, forward via email your full Biota (i.e.) Company name, address, private fax and telephone for further discussions or contact me on my direct private line. 234-1-7755802.  Please treat this matter with absolute confidentiality.

REQUEST FOR
URGENT
ASSISTANCE/INVESTMENT.
Dear Sir/Madam ,
My names is MR. JIDE WILLIAMS,
the elder son of Mr. ANTHONY WILLIAMS, of Zimbabwe. It might be a
surprise to you where I got your contact address, I got it from network on line, South African. During the current crises against the farmers of Zimbabwe
by the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms
to his party members and their followers.
My father was one of the best
farmers in the country and knowing that he did not support the presidential
political ideology, the presidential supporters invaded
my fathers farm
burnt down everything, shot him and as a result of the wounds
sustained, he
became sick and died after two days. And after his death, I with
younger Brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our
lives
to South-Africa.
BUT, before he died HE WROTE HIS WILL, which reads
BELOVEED SON ,I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO
THE SUM OF ($9,000,000=00).
MILLION U.S DOLLARS WHICH
I DEPOSITED IN A BOX WITH A SECURITY COMPANY IN
JOHANNESBURG (SOUTH-AFRICA). IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE
ON EARTH CAUSED BY DEATH ONLY". You should solicit for
reliable foreign partner to assist you
to transfer this money out of South Africa for
investment purpose. I deposited the money in your name and it can be
claimed by you alone with the deposit code. your mother has all the documents. Take good care of your mother and brother." From the above, you will understand that the lives and
future of my family depends on this money as much, I will be very grateful if you can assist us. I with my younger brother are now
living in South-Africa as POLITICAL ASYLUM SEEKERS and the financial law of SOUTH-AFRICA does not allow ASYLUM SEEKERS certain Financial rights to such huge amount of money .In view of this, I cannot invest this money in South-Africa, hence I am asking you to assist me transfer this money out of South-Africa for investment purposes. For your efforts, I am prepared to offer you 20% of the total
fund, while 5% will be set aside for local and international expenses and 75% will be kept for me and my family
Finally modalities on how the transfer will be done will be
conveyed to you
once we establish trust and confidence between ourselves.
Looking forward to your urgent reply .For detailed information.
NOTE:
THE KEY WORD TO THIS TRANSACTION IS ABSOLUTE CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECRECY. THIS
TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE. YOUR URGENT RESPONSE WILL BE
HIGHLY
APPRECIATED.
BEST REGARDS,

Dear sir,
This letter may come to you as a surprise because we have not met. The decision to write you is out of a sincere desire to establish a business/mutual relationship with you. I got your contact through the international trade and commerce chamber (ITCC) in Madrid.
My name is Thomas Sesay Karimu, the son of John Karimu (former secretery of state for mining and industry) who was killed and mutilated by the military junta led by Major Paul Koroma after over-throwing the elected government of President Tijan Kabba. Though, I don't know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbances in Sierra-Leone but it had consistent features in the BBC, CNN news bulletins. The pressure of war drove my family out of Sierra-Leone into exile in Spain where we have been living under political asylum for three years.
Sadly, my mother died of cancer 4 months ago and was buried in Madrid. Prior to her death, she gave me a certificate of a secret deposit that my father made in a security company in Europe (destination will be disclosed later for security reasons) The money $45,000,000.00 (forty-five million dollars) was deposited as family treasure. He did this with a view to converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces when the conflict intensified. I have however  contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership.
Due to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra-Leone, I have decided to solicit the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will assist in investing the money. I cannot do it alone due to my present political status and total ignorance of the business world. You will be given a negotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction.
If you are honest, trustworthy and interested in the above proposal, contact me immediately through my email address for more details. You must maintain absolute confidentiality in order to ensure success. Please, indicate your personal telephone/fax numbers when replying.
Best Regards,
Thomas Sesay Karimu.  Hello From Mrs. Victoria Bucknor
No. 5667 Allen Avenue,
Victoria Garden City
Marine Beach.
Date: 4th October, 2003.
Attention:
Dear Sir,
PRAISE GOD, THE MOST BENEVOLENT.
I am Mrs. Victoria Bucknor,named person from Nigeria. I am married to Late Mr. George Bucknor of blessed memory who worked with Nigeria embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in the year 2000.
We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very devoted christain.Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5Million (Five Million U.S. Dollars) in a security company. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three  months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a church/organisation or devoted christain individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here- in. I want this church/organisation or individual to use this money in all sincererity to
fund building church,orphanages,widows and also propagating the word of GOD and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy
bible.
The holy bible emphasized so much on GOD benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step. I took this decision because I  don’t have any child that will inherit this money, and I don’t want my husband’s hard earned money to be misused by people I call unbelievers. I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with GOD the most benevolent and the most merciful. I don’t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also of the presence of my husband’s relatives around me always.
I don’t want them to know about this development. With GOD all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply, I will forward it to my family attorney and I will then instruct him to give you the contact of the
Security Company. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the christains/Muslims communities where you reside to always pray for me.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted christain worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve the GOD must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church/organisation or a devoted christain for this same purpose.
Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders.
May the almighty GOD continue to guide and protect you.
Regards,
Mrs. Victoria BucknorDONATION FOR THE LORD.

FROM  DUKE
Greeting,
This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person
nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know
somebody either in physical or through correspondence.
I got your contact through some discreet inquire from the chamber of
commerce and industry,you and your company were revealed as being quite
astute in private entreprenuership.one has no doubt in your ability to
handle a financial business transaction.
However, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty,WIWA DUKE and the
traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of
Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 20,000,000.00
(twenty million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late
father the money was accumulated from royalties rapid to my father as
compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil
presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of
livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But
before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged
some funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary
status. The lodgment Security Code Number
was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable
business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a
lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this
is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money
from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment
purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the
funds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your
choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had
intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is
his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when
due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I
will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss
physically on Investment potentials.
Based on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20%
of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may
arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The
balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family.
I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not
drug money and it is not money from arms deal.
Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this
matter. I will give you
all proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully
satisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the
beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.
Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me

Before the death of my Husband, on may 15th,2003 during an attempt by the rebels on the life of president C.Taylor, where he was brutally injured and subsiquently rushed to the presidential hospital in monrovia where he later died.Before his death,he secretly called me to his bedside and told me that he has the sum of US$18Million dollars (Eighteen million dollars)that he used my name as his legal wife as the beneficiary and next of kin in depositing the fund with a clearing house in European country. The major reason is that the fund was deposited in a Security Company in Europe it was because of the ways the president was ruling the country,that he foresee things might go wrong with him in due course. Right now, the rebels are at war with the !
president and the
America government has asked the president to step down. I am now in cotonou-Republic of Benin as a refugee because i am being sought after by the rebels since my husband was seen as one of Taylor's strong men as they want to wipe out our family. In this respect,i am honourably seeking your assistance in thefollowing ways :

PRINCE  DUKEUrgent Reply
It is with hope that I write to seek your help in this
context. Firstly,let me start by introducing myself
properly to you. My name is Thomas M.Ralph Taylor, the first
son of President Charles Taylor of Liberia. I got your
email address from network directory. I apologize if I
have infringed on your privacy.
You maybe aware, that my father President Charles
Taylor has been embattled by rebel forces in my
country, couple with his recent indictment by U.N
backed tribunal. These issues, have made world
headlines. Visit, www.liberianews.com
Now my father has accepted to quit power and leave
Liberia on the arrival of peacekeeping force which
might be headed by American troops. But the delay in
deploying peace keeping force, has worsen situation in
the country. In spite of this, My country Liberia, is
like a herd of cattle without shepherd. Rebels Groups
are still fighting to oust my father and assume office
as leaders. The rebel who see my family as a threat to
their ambitions, are planning to kill
every one of us when capture.
However, I am a young man who has ambitions and I am
not in any way interested in wars, this is why I
secretly left Liberia for Amsterdam to seek asylum.
Besides, I am using this correspondence to seek and
request your assistance and cooperation in a sensitive
but highly beneficial financial arrangement.
Prior to the Wars and embattlement of my father,
himself and I deposited a huge amount of money in a
security company?s vault overseas on my name. The
funds were arranged into a consignment before
deposited with the security company But, the security
company did not know that the consignment contains
money. Because, The consignment was declared to
contain family treasure and valuables.
The fact that the war persist and we continue to
accumulate huge debts daily as long as the consignment
remains in the security company?s vault, made me
decided to get someone reliable to proceed as soon as
possible to receive these funds
for investment purpose. As a young man, I plan to use
this money to safeguard my future.
It is very essential that you understand the kind of
trust and confidence I want to put in you. This is an
act of desperation on my part, in order not to loose
this money incase of any eventuality. For your
reliable assistance, if willing, I will reward you
with 25% of the money.
As soon as you declare your willingness to assist, i
shall furnish you with the details and information you
will need to accomplish this task. Please, be rest
assured that this arrangement is absolutely risk free
And cannot implicate you in any way. However, I
implore you to handle this matter with urgency, utmost
secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety
reasons, even if you do not intend to execute the
project.
Thank you in anticipation for your assistance in
enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me
whether or not you are interested in assisting me.
This will enable me scout for another perosn in the
event of non-interest on your part.
Your?s sincerely,
Mr Thomas M.Ralph TaylorPROJECT

there lives as they are on a weekend outing to a nearby city.
I contacted you based on trust to assist me in repatriating his money
and property he left behind, before they get confiscated or declared
unserviceable by the Security Company where his huge deposit was lodged.
Particularly, the deceased has an Amount of $12.6 million dollars,
after my written notification about the death of the deceased to the
security Company they have issued me a notice to provide the next of
kin or
have the Funds confiscated within the next 60 days.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives all this
while, that's why I seek your consent to assert you as the next of kin
the deceased, so that the proceeds of this Amount valued at $12.6
million
dollars can be paid to you as the bonafide approved Next of Kin by the
security Company.
If you agree the money will be shared in a ratio of 75% for me while 20%=
for you and 5% will set aside for any expenses incured during the transfe=
process.
I have all necessary documents to
to back up the facts and claim on the Fund Release.
All I require is your honest, co-operation and Sincerity to enable us
seeing that this funds is paid to you.
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any breach of the law.

HENRICH AGAH& ASSOCIATES,

RIVERS STATE
NIGERIA. 
Dearest friend,
I am Barrister Henrich Agah, a Solicitor. I am the
Personal Attorney and Legal Representative to "Mr.
Gary Val", a national of your country, who used to
work with Shell Oil Development Company in Nigeria.
On the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife and
their three children were involved in a car accident
along Abuja Express Road. Unfortunately, they all lost
their lives in the event of the accident. Since then,
I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to
locate any of my client's extended relatives, this has
also proved unsuccessful.
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided
to trace a reliable person  over the Internet to
locate any member of his family but of no avail,
hence, I contacted you to assist in repatriating the
money left behind by my client in a Security Company
here in Nigeria.Particularly, the Security Company
where the deceased deposited the two trunk boxes
containing $10 Million(TEN Million United States
Dollars Only) does not know the content of the two
trunk boxes deposited with them. 
Consequently, the Security Company issued me a notice
to provide the Next-of-Kin to claim the two trunk
boxes in their custody within the next ten official
working days.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the
relatives for over 2 years now, I seek your consent to
present you as the next-of-kin of the deceased to
claim the two trunk boxes since you are from the same
country so that the two trunk boxes can be  delivered
to you by the security company.
Upon receipt of the two trunk boxes, I will come over
to your country to meet with you for the disbursement
of the fund, and then you and me can share the money.
60% to me and 40% to you. I have all necessary legal
documents that can back up any claim we may make with
the Security Company. 
All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us
see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will
protect you from any breach of the law.
Please get in touch with me by my secured and
confidential e-mail address at hc_agah555@fsmail.net 
Best regards

POSTSCRIPT: Please indicate your telephone and fax
number for further discussion/ clarificationASSISTANCE
Goodday,
I am Joseph vaye,the son of late Issac Nuhan Vaye, deputy minister of public
works under President charles taylor of Liberia.
Before the political upheaval in liberia my late father was a good and
close 
friend of president
charles taylor and a member of his inner caucus.But of late when liberia
crisis came up again,with the rebels trying to oust charles taylor out
government and liberia,president charles taylor became very uncomfortable
with some of his loyalists which my late father happened to be one of them
because he had the believe that at the rate at which the rebel group was
closing in on him in Monrovia(which is the seat of power)was as a result
the leakage of some vital security information  from his cabinet and he
decided to eliminate some of his cabinet members which my father happened
be a victim.
It started in the name of an uncovered coup and he ordered the arrest of
some of his cabinet ministers
and the Vice President Moses Blah on the 5th of june which my father was
included and some days later we learnt about my father's death alongside
with John Winpoe Yormie, deputy minister of national security.
My mother and i actually knew why my father was murdered because before
political mayhem in
liberia,my late father  and President charles taylor have maintained a
good 
relationship and he has
assisted him in lodging funds from the sales of diamond in different banks
and security companies which my late father also benefited from it until
the wake of rebellious war in liberia my father was not getting along with
President Charles taylor because of his tyranic law which created a breach
in their relationship and with the alarming rate at which the rebels are
advancing into Monrovia to unseat President charles taylor he was no longer
sure of  some of his cabinet members and decided to eliminate
them under the disguise that they were coup plotters
Before the death of my father, at the peak of his relationship with 
president charles taylor,he was able
to accumulate some funds $31,600,000.00 (US$31.6million)which he deposited
with a security company in Ghana from the deals he did for the president.
Basically my mother and i require a trustworthy person that can assist
us to 
retrieve our funds from the
security company in Ghana.Life has been very unstable for us(my mum,my
youngers ones and i) and i would not want to bore you with all we went
through but for the sake of my late fathers death. All the necessary 
documents for the deposit are in my possession I am now a refugee in 
neigbouring african country Ghana due to the fear of been killed by 
president charles taylor and the unrest in Liberia.
Ironically the president of Nigeria  has agreed to grant  president charles
taylor assylum in Nigeria in
order to restore peace in liberia so we are trying to do all  we can at
earnest to retrieve the funds from
the security company and leave West Africa before he eventually comes to
Nigeria.
Upon your response to this mail,i will intimate you on how we can proceed
get the funds from the security company.
Best regards,
JosephGOOD RELATIONSHIP
Mr. Donga Kabaka.
P. O. Box 241. Sharjah, United Arab Emirate UAE
Email:dongakabaka555@yahoo.com
Dear Sir/Madam
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me
since you do not know me personally. For the purpose
of introduction, I am Mr. Donga Kabaka, the son of Dr.
James Kabaka, a wealthy black farmer/politician in
Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my
country.
The land problem, in our country came when our
President Mr. Robert Mugabe in a bid to win his
re-election, introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly
affecting the rich white farmers and the black farmers
who are members of the opposition (MDC) party. This
resulted in killings and mob action by Zimbabwean war
veterans and some lunatics in the society. It is
against this background that I and my immediate family
had fled Harare our capital for fear of our lives and
are currently staying in a country side of
United Arab Emirate. We are planning to leave
the country and seek political asylum in Europe and we
have decided to move our family wealth to Europe.
We got your contact through the Internet based on our
urgent need for a dependable and trustworthy foreign
partner and hence decided to write to you. Before the
death of my late father, he had taken me to
United Aram Emirate several times and had
deposited the total sum of US$20.5 million (Twenty
million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars),
in one of the private security companies, as he
foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was
deposited in two boxes as Family Treasures to avoid
much demurrage from the security company. This amount
was meant for the purchase of new machines and
chemicals for the Farms and the establishment of new
farms in Swaziland.
As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the
responsibility of seeking a genuine partner that could
assist us without the knowledge of my government who
are bent on taking everything we have got, and the
United Arab Emirate seems to be playing along
with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this
amount of money out of United Arab Emirate for fear of going
through the same experience in future.
We are seeking a partner whom I have to entrust my
future and that of my family in his/her hands. To this
end, we need your assistance to stand as the
Beneficiary of the Consignments in Europe. This is
because we are under restricted movement and watch and
hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose
this fund, which we have worked so hard for. I have a
sufficient CONTACT person at the Security Company in
United Arab Emirate who can help us move this money to Europe
under DIPLOMATIC COVER to another Security Company in
Europe with your details as the Beneficiary. This is
100% legal and will not pass through normal
Customs/Airport Screening.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this
fund out of UAE, you can contact me through
my email address with your telephone, fax number and
personal information to enable us discuss further
details. I must let you know that this transaction is
risk free as far as we keep it as confidential as
possible. Thank you and many blessings to you.
Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Donga Kabaka.FROM:MRS. M SESE-SEKO.

from our Chamber of Commerce here and after due
consultation, I decided to contact you believing that
by the grace of God that you will be my
partner in this business. I have worked with this
company for over 12 years, within this period of time
I watched with meticulous precision on
how African Head of State and government functionaries
have been moving huge sums of money (Dollars, Pound
Sterling, French Franc, Cash)with the aid of their
foreign partners abroad.
They bring in these consignment of money cash and
secretly declare the content as jewelries, Gold,
Precious Stones, Family Treasure, Documents,etc.
Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Fodey Sankoy of Sierra
Leone, FelixHouphet Buigny of Ivory Coast, Konnan Bede
of Ivory Coast, etc.
These people have at one time or the other
depositedconsignments withus and their foreign
partners, relatives and Next of Kin are Claiming most
of these consignment and a lot more are laying here
unclaimed for as much as 7 years, as no available
information to anybody except the depositors, and most
of them are dead. Since the inception of the year
2003, GLOBAL SECURITY COMPANY LTD Management changed
the procedure of claiming of consignments.
As soon as you are able to produce all the secret
information as contained in the secret file of the
company as regard the consignment, it will be released
to you upon demand. From our records, more
than 10 consignments belonging to these people has
been claimed in the past six months and this is why I
am seeking for your co-operation and assistance.
Mr. Francis Carden is a Zimbabwean, and he work with
one of the top ministers of President Robert Mugabe

Mr. Mugabe into office in their last election. He
deposited this consignment in 1999 after absconding
with the money 35.5 million United State Dollars
($35.5m USD).
Unfortunately, Mr. Francis Carden died in Kenyan
aircraft that killed all on board in 2000.
Since his death, no one knows about this transaction
with Global Security Company Ltd except me who acted
as company attorney when he deposited the consignment.
I have finished every arrangement for you to come and
claim the consignment as the next of Kin to Mr.
Francis Carden.
The procedure is very simple: - Apply officially to

They will demand for some documents and the security
code of the consignment, you will call on me to supply
you with every detailed Information as regard the
consignment.

company will invite you for the collection.
Nobody will ever know that I am involved in the deal
, I suggest upon conclusion, we share it on the Ratio
of 50%-40%and 10% will go for humanitarian service ie
motherless babies home, more also you will make an
arrangement on investments that I will invest my money
in your country.

Dear Sir 
My name is LOI C. ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located in the South East Asia. 
My husband was recently impeached from office by a backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the Senate. 
My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption, embezzlement, and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. The present government is forcing my husband out of manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter. 
During my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now. 
before my husband was impeached, I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000 million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) out of Philippines and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold and my foreign business partner owned it. 
I am contacting you because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. 
I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. 
When I receive your positive response I will let you know where the security company is and the payment pin code to claim the money which is very important. 
For now, all our communication is by e-mail because my line are right now connected to the Philippines Telecommunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. 
I will ask my son to contact you to give you more details , after i have received a responce from you. 
Thank you and God bless you and family.

hello my dear,
my name is aishatu ahmed.my father was recently murdered in tripoli as a result of family and friends conflicts due to a substantial amount he made while he was in the ministry.generally,most rich men keep such fund at their homes as it is illegal for one to keep such amount in any bank in lybia without a proper explaination as per how such fund was made .so these wicked people thought that this fund was still in our mansion and they tried to eliminate all our house hold in order to get free access to our home to search for it  unknowing to them that my late father had already moved the fund to a finance house in europe through diplomatic means leaving me as the beneficiary as if he forsaw the danger in our family.just one week after his burial,these people broke into our home with gun shots everywhere which resulted to the death of my only little brother.that very night,i and my mother escaped and ran to a country(by road) called burkina faso where we ar!
e for the moment in a hidden hotel.i got your contact from a consultancy firm here in burkina faso,though i did not let them know my main reason of contacting you for confidential sake as i only told them that i needed your contact for pen pals.i need your faithfully and confidential asistance to get this fund from the finance house in europe as we are financially down due to our unprepared journey to this place,ofwhich we left all our belongings and other valuables for our dear lives hoping to get this money out of the finance house.luckily for us,we came here with all the documents relating to this fund.if you have any question to ask,please feel free to do so and get back to me soonest.

Mr Richard Akwasi
reply atternative email: richardakwasi@z6.comRe: the issue
Dear Sir,
My name is Mohammed Hamid, I am from Iraq. My cousin was a top officer in the former Government of Sadam Hussein. Before the beginning of the war he gave me 75,000,000.00 (Seventy Five Million United States Dollars) to keep for him.
I managed to move the box containing the money out of Iraq through diplomatic immunity to a Security company in London , U.K  and the box is been deposited as family treasure, for security reasons. Now that the war is over I want to move the money to your country for safety reasons. Be rest assured that this transaction is risk free as no person is aware of this money. 
You will be compensated with 25% of the total sum, if you can assist. Expecting your urgent reply via mohammed@fsmail.net   .
Yours Faithfully, 
Mohammed .I NEED YOUR ASSISTANT
It is with hope that I write to seek your help in this
context. Firstly, let me start by introducing myself
properly to you. My name is Ralph Taylor, the first
son of President Charles Taylor of Liberia. I got your
email address from network directory. I apologize if I
have infringed on your privacy.
You maybe aware, that my father President Charles
Taylor has been embattled by rebel forces in my
country, couple with his recent indictment by U.N
backed tribunal. These issues have made world
headlines. Visit, www.liberianews.com
Now my father has accepted to quit power and leave
Liberia on the arrival of peacekeeping force which
might be headed by American troops. But the delay in
deploying peace keeping force has worsened situation in
the country. In spite of this, my country Liberia is
like a herd of cattle without shepherd.
The rebel who see my family as a threat to
their ambitions, are planning to kill
every one of us when capture.
However, I am a young man who has ambitions and I am
not in any way interested in wars, this is why I
secretly left Liberia for Amsterdam to seek asylum.
Besides, I am using this correspondence to seek and
request your assistance and cooperation in a sensitive
but highly beneficial financial arrangement.
Prior to the Wars and embattlement of my father,
himself and I deposited a huge amount of money in a
security company’s vault overseas on my name. The
funds were arranged into a consignment before
deposited with the security company but, the security
company did not know that the consignment contains
money. Because, the consignment was declared to
contain family treasure and valuables.
The fact that the I remain in the Asylum camp and we continue to
accumulate huge debts daily as long as the consignment
remains in the security company’s vault, made me
decided to get someone reliable to proceed as soon as
possible to receive these funds
for investment purpose. As a young man, I plan to use
this money to safeguard my future.
It is very essential that you understand the kind of
trust and confidence I want to put in you. This is an
act of desperation on my part, in order not to loose
this money incase of any eventuality. For your
reliable assistance, if willing, I will reward you
with 25% of the money.
As soon as you declare your willingness to assist, i
shall furnish you with the details and information you
will need to accomplish this task. Please, be rest
assured that this arrangement is absolutely risk free
And cannot implicate you in any way. However, I
implore you to handle this matter with urgency, utmost
secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety
reasons, even if you do not intend to execute the
project.
Thank you in anticipation for your assistance in
enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me
whether or not you are interested in assisting me.
This will enable me scout for another person in the
event of non-interest on your part.
Yours sincerely,
Mr. Ralph TaylorPlease Help Me!!!
I humbly introduce myself to you; I am Mrs. Alhaja Rashidat Azmil the wife Of 
Captain Azmil who served in
Iraq.I am contacting you base on trust and humanitarian assistance which I 
urgently need from
you. The recent concluded US led war against my country has left my family 
totally devastated as I
lost my Husband to the cold hands of death and the children lost thei 
father.Long before this war
started, my late husband had in his custody $20.7 Million U.S Dollars, but due 
to serious threat of war
from the United States and the collision forces (if our dictator president 
does not amend his ways), my
husband had to act fast and at such deposited these funds in a Diplomatic 
Condominium in a neighboring
country for the purpose of our family survival after the war might have been 
over.
I am writing you this letter because our dreams was not fulfilled as we could 
not leave Iraq before the
war but we did however succeeded in getting the children to a neighboring 
country first before trying
to proceed with getting ourselves out. It was in the process of us (my Husband 
and I) escaping to a
neighboring country that we came under friendly fire. It was this mistake that 
took my husband’s life and
critically injured me as the truck we were in went out of control into a brick 
wall. I was rushed to a
military hospital in a neighboring country where I am currently admitted and 
writing this
letter. I am recovering well and now that my health has improved dramatically, 
I need to think of the
futureof my Children and who to trust in sending theentire amount kept by my 
late husband for investment
and acquiring immigration papers for my children. 
If you believe you can assist me on this endeavor,kindly reply me at 
r_azmil@land.ru so that I shall forward to 
you all the details required to carry on this transaction successfully. I look 
forward to your prompt favorable
response.Thanks for your understanding.
Yours Respectfully,
Mrs. Rashidat Azmil.

Republic Of South Africa.
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am Mr Pikka Saaiman, General Manager(Treasury) of Land Bank,South
Africa.This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition.
I am in a position to influence the transfer of 
US$26,500,000.00,(Twenty-six Million, five hundred thousand Dollars). 
This fund was deposited by a customer who was a foreign contractor with
the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.
Upon maturity of the deposit,The bank sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and
finally we discovered from his contract employers,South African Institute
of Mining and Metallurgy, that Mr.paul bryson was dead.On further
investigation,I found out  from his attorney that he died without making
a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.paul bryson
did not declare any kin or relations in all his official
documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping.
>From our records the funds was deposited in the year 2000 and  according
to south african Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will
revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the
fund.
I will need you to stand in as his next of kin,i have already made
arrangements with an attorney who will prepare all the necessary documents
that will make this possible as i will follow all the necessary protocols
and laws governing inheritance in my country.
I am willing to offer you 40% of the funds so that i can gaurantee your
commitment to this project.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address  and 
Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details that will
help you understand how i plan to implement this project.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your
country.
Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our
communication can only be via email and fax mostly.
Awaiting your urgent reply
Thanks and my regards.
pikka saaimanSOLICITING YOUR ASSISTANCE
Dear  freind,
This is a proposal in context but actually an appeal
soliciting
for your unreserved assistance in carrying out  an
urgent
transaction requiring maximum confidence. Though this
approach
appears desperate, I can assure you that whatever
questions you would need to ask or any other thing you
will
need to know regarding this proposal will be
adequately
answered to give you a clearer understanding of it, so
as to
arrive at a successful conclusion.
My name is Dr Pimentel luisa Estrada, wife of His
Excellency
Joseph Estrada, former President of The Philippines.
My husband
was impeached from office by a backed uprising
of mass
demonstrators and the Senate and is presently in jail
trumped up charges of corruption, embezzlement, and
the mysterious
charge of economy plunder which might lead to death
sentence.
The present government is forcing my husband out of
Manila to
avoid demonstration by his supporters. As God would
have it,i realised some
reasonable amount of money from various deals that I
successfully executed, during my husband's regime as
President
of Philippines. I have plans to invest this money for
children's future on real estate and industrial
production.
I have carefully moved out these funds (US$30
million), before
my husband was impeached to an offshore Deposit
Company
in the European Union. My husband is not aware of this
because
I want to handle it secretly for obvious resons.
>From past experiences, many people I had regarded as
close
friends has capitalized on my family's travail to run
away with
my money. In order to avert this negative development,
My son and i now seek your permission to
allow my
attorney do a CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP/REASSIGNMENT OF
CREDIT of the stated
funds from the deposit company to your name, so that
the funds (US$30million) would be released to you as
the new
owner (on my familys behalf).
I am writing because when I deposited the money in the
deposit
company, I told them that it belonged to a foreign
business
partner and my present position will not allow me to
claim the
funds. Consequently, I will present you as the owner
of the
funds in the Deposit Company so you can be able to
claim the funds. This
is simple. I will like you to provide immediately;
1. Full names
2. Contact address
3. Telephone and fax numbers
Once I receive this information, I will prepare the
necessary
documents that will put you in place as the new owner
of the
funds.
The money will then be released to your custody by the
Deposit
Company, for us to share in the ratio of 70% for us
and 30% for
you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for
this
transaction will be done by the solicitor and this
will
guarantees the successful execution of this
transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via my
email
address. Upon your response, I shall then introduce
you to my
son who is going to liaise with you for further
explanation that
will help you understand the transaction.
No doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive,
please we
employ you to observe utmost confidentiality and rest
assured
that this transaction would be most profitable for
both of us
because we shall require your assistance to invest our
share in
your country (buying of properties like houses, hotels
This is why your urgent action and response is of
priority to
enable us concluded this transaction in a timely and
professional
manner..
Please reply me  AT the email address below , my
personal email ,
Email : drluisaestrada1@philippines.to
For utmost confidentiality sake.
I do expect to hear from you shortly , but if you are
not interested ,
please accept my unreserved apology.
Thanks and regards

Sir/Madam, 
RE:ACCEPTANCE / INVESTMENT PROPOSAL 
INTRODUCTION: l am MISS.CYNTHIA PEPPLE first daugther to my
late father and also a Civil Servant in 
the Ministry of Health. l know this proposal will come 
to you as a surprise because we have not met before 
either physically or through correspondence. 
I got your contact through a friend working with 
chamber of commerce here 
in Nigeria who have travelled far and wide and have no
doubt in your ability to handle 
this proposal involving huge sum of money. 
THE SUBJECT: My Father CHIEF. Dominic pepple(Now Late) 
was the Royal Head of my community, ELEME (an oil rich 
town) in Nigeria. My community produces 5.8% of the 
total crude oil production in Nigeria and 0.5% of the 
Dollar value of each barrel is paid to my father as 
royalty by the Federal Government. My father was also 
the Chairman of ELEME Special Oil Trust Fund. 
In his position as the Royal head and Chairman of the 
Oil Trust Fund, he made some money which he left for 
me as the only heir to inherit.The money is FIVE
Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars($5.5m). 
This Money originated from the accumulated royalties 
between 1976-1998 . 
Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and political 
instability as a result of past Military rules 
(1985-1999) , he deposited this Money in a VAULTS 
" with an open beneficiary to a security company 
pending when he would finish arrangement to get
assistant  abroad. He was planning this when he 
suddenly 
died late last year of Heart Attack. 
THE PROPOSAL: Just before my Father died he called my 
attention to the money and charged me to look for a 
foreigner who would assist me in accepting/investment of
the funds abroad. So l would be 
very grateful if you could accept to help me achieve 
this great objective. I promise to give you 20% of the 
total funds as compensation for your assistance. Five
percent 
(5%)would be set aside to take care of any expenses we 
may incure during the transaction. To indicate your 
interest, contact me urgently and confidentially 
for more information and the roles you will play in 
this 
business. All the legal Documents concerning this 
Money will be sent to you as soon as we agreed 
together. Send your reply through this box please. 
May the almighty God bless you.

burnt our house and
killed him.
Before the death of my husband he reveal to me where
he deposited$9.5 million US dollar,deposited in a west African
Country Ghana.
I and my son Henrry,have since been rescued by the
intervention of the
(U.N) peace keeping force, and have manage to escape
to the Republic of Ghana with my son. And we are now
presently taking
refugee in a refugee camp here in Ghana.

money that it is in the box, all the Document as to
the claim of the Consignments containing the money are

pick up the
consignments.

My lawyer phone number
Dear Sir, I am Princess IFEOMA , daughter of HRH King
Solomon Abonime, the king of Ogoni Kingdom. I am 25
years old and a graduate of Mass Communication. My
father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil
producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of
reviving royalties from the multi-national oil
companies and government on behalf of the oil
producing communities in Nigeria. After the hanging of
the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late
dictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered
stroke and died in August27th last year. But before
his death, he called me and told me he has sixthy six Million United States Dollars
(USD66,000,000.00) cash in his possession, specially
deposited in a Security vault company in eroupe. He
advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is
the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married.
My mother did not bear any male child for him. Which
implies that all my father’s properties, companies
e.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has
no male child according to African Tradition. My
father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant
documents of the said money, and told me that I should
use this money with my mother and my younger sisters
because he knows that tradtionally, if he dies we
cannnot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly
advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and
that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria
because of his other wives and male children who
happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your
immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I
will live with my mother and two younger sisters and
further advise me where and how I will invest the
balance money overseas, possibly on products of your
company and other profitable ventures. I believe that
by the special grace of God, you will help us move
this money out of eroupe to your country where we can
invest this money judiciously with you. You are
entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on
our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us.

Source of the money:
My late father Chief Paul Coleman , a native of Mende District in the Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales.
Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to HOLLAND NETHERLAND, with the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with a security firm in Europe through the aid
of U.N evacuation team.
During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including other top Government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's involvement in the air crash in Januaryit dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have spent a lot of money on her early this year .

Mr. JOHN COLEMAN.Dearest friend
Dearest friend
From: Mrs. Juliana Faith Peters
Bless the children of God.
I am the above named person but now undergoing medical
treatment now. I am married to Dr.Alan George Peters
who worked with south africa embassy in nigeria for
nine years before he died in the year 2001.
We were married for eleven years without a child. He
died after a brief illness that lasted for only four
days. Before his death we were both born again
Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry
or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the
Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he
deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven Million
six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one
finance/security company in Europe.
Presently, this money is still with the Security
Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not
last for the next three months due to cancer problem.
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.
Having known my condition I decided to donate this
fund to church or better still a christian individual
that will utilize this money the way I am going to
instruct here in. I want a church or individual that
will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows
propagating the word of God and to ensure that the
house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to
understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don?t have any child
that will inherit this money and my husband relatives
are not Christians and I don?t want my husband?s hard
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?t
want a situation where this money will be used in an
ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold
decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where
I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom
of the Lord.
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case
and I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone
communication in this regard because of my health,and
because of the presence of my husband?s relatives
around me always. I don?t want them to know about this
development. With God all things are possible. As soon
as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact
of the Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also
issue you a letter of authority that will empower you
as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you
and the church to always pray for me because the lord
is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of
a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the
Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always
be prayerful all through your
life.
Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing
for a church or christian individual for this same
purpose. Please assure me that you will act
accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from
please reply me through this email;
<mrsjfpeters@postmaster.co.uk>
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs Juliana faith peters.

FROM: MRS, FATIMA RASHEED KHALIFA
ADDRESS:NORTH ZONE BAZRA IRAQ.)
Please permit me your little endulgence to solicit
for your unreserved attention,
based on my urgly condition of life though one with
almighty Allah is with majority.
I am Mrs Fatima R. Khalifa, a widow to Late Sheik
Mohammed Rasheed Khalifa.
I am 64 years old of a born muslim faith. Presently
i am suffering from long time cancer of the breast, from
all indications, my condition is really deteriorating
and is quite obvious that I won't live more than six
months according to my doctor,because the cancer stage has
gotten to a very bad stage.
My late husband was killed during the invasion of
collition forces from American and Britain in Iraq,
unfortunately he died leaving behind a huge sum of money
which he had looted from a supply of ammunition to
the ex- Saddam Hussein Government.
This money is now in the vault of a private security
company oversea to be precise in Holland,
but due to my present bad condition of health as I
am suffering from Cancer of the breast its quite
impossible for me to travel that distance to receive
this money.
To this effect I have writen a letter throgh my
family lawyer requesting for the transfer
of this box to Dubai United Arab Emirates pending
when I can succeed in getting a trust and
reliable person to utilize this money. Although,
today, I have received a signal from the security
company notifying me of the approval to transfer  the
consignment through their agent.
Therefore, let me receive your total support and
security assurance that the consignment will
be save in your hand .
I want you to understand that a neither have any son
nor have any person to entrust this
money to which I know that it is better make use of
a total foreigner to achieve my aim.
Atleast had it been that during the period of our
marriage we could produce any child, my late
husband was very wealthy and after his death, his
offspring will inherited all his business and wealth.
I got your contact through a desperate and personal
search on the web, for someone
I could really trust and I have prayed over it.
Therefore my desire now is to contribute part of
this  wealth to the propagation of islam and in
assisting the less-privileged Muslim faithful in
Africa,Asia,Europe and in all Arab-Nation's .
I have discussed this with my Family Lawyer hence I
am willing to donate part of it atleast 40% of  the
total sum of US$16,250,00000. (sixteen Million two hundred
and fifty thousand US Dollars)for the development of
the holy work of islam, as well as distribution's to aid
muslim's faithfuls.
Please I want you to note that, this fund is lying
in a Security Company in Holland The Netherlands so it can be
transferred to you upon your readiness to co-join with me in this
transaction and secure the money.
For that, my lawyer will file application's that
will back you up for the transfer of
the money in your name as the beneficiary only if
you promise to use this funds/my donations
judiciouly for the said purpose.
Therefore,I have decided to set-aside 40% for the
promotion of holy islam and the work of Allah.
while 30% will be retuned back to me through my
lawyer so that I can offset my bills
in the hospital because of the cancer treatment.
If you have to die says the Allah, keep fit and I
will give you the crown of life.
May the Grace of Allah be our guide and be my refuge
when i leave this world.
Moreso,I further decided to offer you 20% While the
remaining 10% is for the expenses incured during
the facillitation of the project.
Yours in Allah,

My family and I are caught up in this web of land politics, which also led to the death of our father. We have seen reforms after reforms by the government of Mugabe and we are fed up with it. Our economy is in shambles and it is just not profitable and safe enough for us to remain in Zimbabwe. We have decided to relocate our farm to Swaziland, a neighbouring country, where we have acquired lands. Our capital base is in South Africa where we are temporarily living pending such time logistics would be ready for full-scale operation in Swaziland. Bearing in mind that Mr. Thabo Mbeki (South African president) and his government are playing Russian roulette over the Zimbabwean land crisis, every effort has begun in earnest to move our capital base to a stable country where it can be safer.

We are therefore contacting you so you can use a magnificent business technique to transfer this financial treasure out of South Africa. This money is presently deposited confidentially with A security Company here in South Africa. We mapped out 25% of the gross sum as due commission for your expected honest assistance in executing the successful transfer of this money out of South Africa, for our family investments.

Dear Friend,
I am Mrs.Mercy Kume, wife of late Mr Anthony Kume, a wealthy Zimbabwean
farmer who was brutally murdered in a land dispute together with his
oversea
partner Mr. pete Bailey and the whole of his family as result of land
reform by Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe. The whole of  our
farmland amd
properties were destroyed by the mobs. The new land act reform which
affected the white and black farmers, resulting to massive killing by
veterans and lunatics in the society.
My husband died without leaving a word neither to me nor our only son,
his partner was rushed to the hospital where he later died after 2
days.
Before my husband partner died, he confided in me that he deposited
US$29,000,000 (Twenty Nine million united states dollars) in one
private
security company in Europe, that the money was meant for the purchase
of new
machineries for mechanised agriculture for the Zimbabwean farmers
movement
and new farms in Swaziland. He said that all I have to do is to source
an oversea partner who can be placed as the Beneficiary of the fund so
that
I and my son can have a new lease of life again. He made me promise
that
since he has no other leaving relatives, that I will not let money go
down
the drain.
I was later diagnosed to have cancer of the breast which resulted to my
losing one part of the breast to surgery. Presently, I am hospitalised
because my condition started deteriorating in a very strange manner. My
doctor gave me the saddest news of life as he told me that the cancer
spread to every part of my body including my liver. I have been boldly
told
that I just have a very short time to leave. As things are now, I am
afraid to die, but I don¡¯t want my son to suffer and I don¡¯t want to
late Mr.Bailey down by not having this claimed.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to
stand in
as the next of kin to Late Mr. Pete Bailey .This you can do by
corroborating
with my Kenneth who is currently seeking political asylum in Europe,
and our
family attorney to actualise this claim. I will request that you send
your personal details viz: Your full name and private home address,
your
telephone and fax number.this will enable the attorney to place you as
next of kin to late Mr.Pete Bailey.The sharing mode will be as follows.
1.30% of the fund will be for you
2.50% will be for my son which you will have to invest for him as his
guadian.
3.10% will be donated to the Southern African research center for
cancer.
4.While 10% will be set out for all the bills encured to conclude this
transaction including the attorney fees.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will

FROM DIDI SITHOLE,
JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.
TELL:+27-732112866.
Dear sir,
I am MR, DIDI SITHOLE, the son of late
MR.PATRICK SITHOLE, who was murdered in a land dispute
in ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for
reliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidential
financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My
late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich
farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the
ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his
alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition
party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South
Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars
($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he
knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was
deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much
dumourage from the security firm.
This money was earmarked for the purchase of new
machinery and chemicals for the farms and the
establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.
This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE
introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the
White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently
condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the
government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob
actions. I and my family who are currently staying in South
Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided
to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the
Trunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher
transfer of the money to a foreign country where we
can invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of
claiming/investing this amount of money in South
Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in
future since both countries have the same political
history. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does
not allow such investment hence I am seeking for
an asylum or refugee.

free and the nature of your business does not
necessary matter. So if you are willing to assist us
claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have

in south africa,he uses most of southafrica land for farming.The Govt in
southafrica gave him those lands for farming and he will pay back when he

successfull in the farming business and he paid all the Govt wanted back.
Some top officials in the Govt were Jealous becos of his
wealth.They wanted him to Join them carry out a dubious deal against the
Govt but he refuse ,so they plan to   kill him  and claim all his wealth
in southafrica.On his way home one day he was coming from the office they

My name is MR.PAUL
MPOYO, elder son of MR. DANIEL MPOYO of Zimbabwe. This might be a surprise to you where I got your contact address.
I got your address from South African Information Exchange in Johannesburg.
During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party members and his followers, he ordered all the
white-owned farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his followers.
My father was one of the best farmers in our country and because he
did not support his idea,supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt
everything in the farm, killing my father and mad away with a lot of items in my father's farm.
After the death of my father, me and my mother and my younger sister decided to move out from Zimbabwe because our lives are still in danger
with the money my father kept in his hidden safe in my mother's house. The amount contained in the safe is US$12.8m (Twelve million, eight hundred thousand US dollars)and we decided to move to the United Arab Emirate(U.A.E) where we deposited the money in a Security Company as valuables.So, I decided to contact overseas Firm that will assist me to move this money out of United Arab Emirate.
We have agreed to give you from the total sum 20% for helping us to move this money to your country and 5%:will be mapped out for expenses both of us might incured during this transaction and 75% will be for me and my family to invest in your country.
All I want is for you to furnish me with all your personal phone and fax numbers for easy communication.
Note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and it requires mutual trust and absolute confidentiality and I have taken care of all formalities regarding it.
Your urgent response will be highly appreciated in this regard.

President Robert Mugabe is treating to kill my father in order to reduce opposition because of his decision. Because of President Mugabe's death treat to my father, my father was able to move us out of Zimbabwe to Democratic republic of Congo for safety and further Education. President Robert Mugabe's government has set up secret camps across the country in which thousands of youths are taught how to torture and kill. You can read more concerning President Roberts Mugube bad manner at; http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3493958.stm
Before my father’s Death, he further told me that he left the sum of $10,500,000.00 United States Dollars for myself and the family in a payment Finance House in London if anything happens to him, base on the fact that we must use the fund for investment as long as we provide the person who will invest on this fund before the Finance house can release the fund.
I will like you to know that I have all the certificate of deposit, which my father gave me concerning the fund. And I have contacted you to present you as the investor. Do get back to me with your full contact information so that I will give you more information on this project.Please contact me on my private email: mikemorgant28@netscape.net

company abroad at the peak of the a political uprising
that rocked my country few years ago. Now that the
crisis has ended , I need a trustworthy person to
proceed to the place of the security company in order to clear the fund and
afterwards,i will come to your country for us to start
a joint business venture as i do not have the

Dear sir/madam,
How are you and your family today? Hope everyone is in good health.
I am THEO MALOBU a citizen of Zimbabwe. I am contacting you from
Cotonou, the Republic of Benin where I was given asylum this year.
I am the only son of late politician KENNETH MALOBU who was a
wealthy known farmer in Zimbabwe in partnership with late Martin
Olds who was also murdered like my father in April 2000. I wouldn’t
go much deep detailing but you can have a look on this site if you
have the time and see what kind of brutal president we have.
<<<<http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html>>>>
Am appealing to you to consider the idea of assisting me in getting
my fund left behind for me by my late father which was safely kept
with a firm in Europe. My status will never in anyway permit me for
carrying out this function being that i am in asylum.
The contents of the consignments as cash was undeclared to the
company but as family valuables. It is the sum of US$7,000.000.00
(SEVEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) cash. If this does interest
you, we can go further for more details and negotiate terms.
Please, let me know if you can assist me and kindly contact me via
my Private mail box below so I can give you more details on how we
shall proceed ( theomalobu@hotmail.ro )
As I wait for your urgent response, I advise you kindly keep this
as top secret for now for my protection.

I'm counting on your honesty, trustworthiness and reliability on this issue I am about to disclose to you.
My father (Late) Dr. Alfred W.Kudoh was an International Businessman,he was assassinated by the rebels during the civil war in my country, but I narrowly escaped with the help of some(ECOMOG)soldiers.
Before his sudden death, He deposited a Consignment containing sum of($US15.500,000.00) Fifteen Million,Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars with a security and finance company in Spain as family treasure using my name as next of kin.
When I called on the security and finance company for claims, I was told by the Manager of the Company that my  late father attached a clause to his file the day the consignment were deposited with them stating that *I MUST SEEK FOREIGN PARTNER ASSISTANCES IN MOVING THIS CONSIGNMENT*.
The above reasons is why I want you to assist me with your influence to facilitate the removal of the Consignment as the beneficiary so that you will make an arrangement for me to re-settle in your country. Once we are there you will help to invest the fund on any profitable business for me.

Awaiting your earnest response via this email:  thomson_kudoh@yahoo.es
With Regards,
Thomson KudohPLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
From: Mrs. Mary Jones 
Reply email to my private email at maryandjonesfamily@yahoo.fr
RE: PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years, before he died in the year 2000.We were both married for eleven years without a child.
He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is all against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18.6Million (Eighteen Million six hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with a finance/security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company in Europe for safe keeping. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problem.
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition of health I have decided to donate this fund to churches, orphanage or a better Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want an individual that will use these fund to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to nderstand that blessed is the hand that giveth.I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. As I do not want a situation whereby this money will be used in an ungodly manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also due of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/ Security Company in Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this said fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my 
shepherd.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here in.
Hoping to hearing from you.
PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE MY LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IMMEDIATELY, HE IS PRESENTLY UNDERGOING SEMINAL RESEACH IN WEST AFRICA, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S A VERY UNDERSTANDING PERSON AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS.

FROM:    MR. SOLOMON ADJEI
TRUST SECURITY COMPANY LTD
ACCRA-GHANA
Dear Friend,
My name is Mr Solomon Adjei, I work in executive capacity with TRUST SECURITY
COMPANY (ltd) Accra Ghana. I joined the services of this company in 1991.
I got the information concerning you and your company from our Chamber of
Commerce here and after due consultation, I decided to contact you believing
that by the grace of God that you will be my partner in this business.
I have worked with this company for over 12 years, within this period of
time I watched with meticulous precision onhow African Head of State and
government functionarieshave been moving huge sums of money (Dollars, PoundSterling,
French Franc, Cash)with the aid of their foreign partners abroad. They bring
in these consignment of money cash and secretly declare the content as jewelries,
Gold, Precious Stones, Family Treasure, Documents,etc. Mobutu Sese Seko
of Zaire, Fodey Sankoy of Sierra Leone, Felix Houphet Buigny of Ivory Coast,
Konnan Bede of Ivory Coast, etc.
These people have at one time or the other deposited consignments with us
and their foreign partners, relatives and Next of Kin are Claiming most
of these consignment and a lot more are laying here unclaimed for as much
as 7 years, as no available information to anybody except the depositors,
and most of them are dead. Since the inception of the year 2003, TRUST SECURITY
COMPANY LTD Management changed the procedure of claiming of consignments.
As soon as you are able to produce all the secret information as contained
in the secret file of the company as regard the consignment, it will be
released to you upon demand. From our records, more than 10 consignments
belonging to these people has been claimed in the past six months and this
is why I am seeking for your co-operation and assistance.
Mr. Martin Greenberg was an American,he worked with one of the top ministers
of President Robert Mugabe who was in charge of the campaigning for re-electing
Mr. Mugabe into office in their last election. He deposited this consignment
containing 35.5 million United State Dollars ($35.5m USD)early in 1999,
this money according to him was to be used for further political programmes.
He died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999 with the Wife (on the Egyptian
990) with reports on CNN as you can verify via the CNN website as state
below:(http://www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html)  He died
alongside with other passengers aboard without leaving any relations as
his wife died as well in the same plane crash.
Since his death, no one knows about this transaction with TRUST SECURITY
COMPANY ltd except me who acted
as company attorney when he deposited the consignment. I have finished every
arrangement for you to come and claim the consignment as the next of Kin
Mr.MARTIN GREENBERG. The procedure is very simple: - Apply officially to
the Director of operation Trust security company Ltd Accra - Ghana, for
the release of consignment No.TSC/15031964. They will demand for some documents
and the security code of the consignment, you will call on me to supply
you with every detailed Information as regard the consignment.
As soon as they have confirmed it to be correct, the company will invite
you for the collection. Nobody will ever know that I am involved in the
deal, I suggest upon conclusion, we share it on the Ratio of 50%-40%and
10% will go for humanitarian service ie, motherless babies home, more also
you will make an arrangement on investments that I will invest my money
in your country.
I assure you that this business is very secure and risk free. Plese, if
you are interested on this proposal, kindly let me know to ebable me know
my stand  and hope on you. you are advise to contact me through my telephone
nuber: 233-244-514-523 for an oral clarification and detailings.
Thanks

>From Mr. Thomas Reardon,
Dear Friend,
Greetings to you and your family in the name of God.I
am personally contacting you in my search 
for a reliable and God fearing person and having
gotten your contact through prayers and 
painstaking efforts I have decided to seek your help
in carrying out my last wish .My name is Thomas Reardon,
55 yrs old and  an American national who
lived in Iraq. Until recently I had investments in oil
and construction in Baghdad. Since the war started in
this country my life has been thrown into severe
mystery. I lost my wife and two children to bombs
dropped in the city. Today, I�m in a hospital in China
with very fatal injuries and I have lost my ability to
talk. My doctors have indicated that my chances of
survival are very slim. I have therefore decided that
part of my fortunes should be distributed to charity
works to help victims of the war in sudan, iraq and
other war zones and the rest part held in trust by you
and use in  future for charity purpose. Before this
happened my business and concern for making money was
all I lived for. 
I never really cared about other values in life. But
since the loss of my family, I have found a  new
desire to assist helpless families and victims of
humanitarian crisis. Shortly after the first gulf war
I deposited the sum of  USD$8.5 million dollars  with
a financial company in Europe,given the complete ruin
and disorder in the country I have no knowledge of any
relative who would be available to help me carry out
this last wish.  Please I want you to help me collect
the deposit  from the company in Europe and distribute
it accordingly. I want you to use your discretion and
judgement to re-emburse yourself at the end of the day
for  all expenses you will incure during the
collection and distribution of funds. If you are
willing to help, please reply as soon as you can so we
can look at your reward and the things you need to do
to collect the money.
Lastly, A list of this orgainization you intend to
distribute this funds to will be highly appreciated.
Upon your reply I shall send you the certifiate of
deposit and ownership certificate that was issued at
the time I deposited the Funds with them. I will also
be sending to you my international passport upon your
reply.
May the good God bless you and your family.

Attention:The President/CEO.
I am barrister David Clovis (Esq.), an English speaking Senegalese Solicitor & Financial Attorney/Consultant.I was the personal attorney to late Daniel Thorp who was an expatriate mining consultant/contractor with Teaser Petroleum Corporation in St Louis-Senegal.Mr. Daniel Thorp here-in-after referred as my client was also a Diamond/Gold Merchant.
Mr.Daniel Thorp made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only) in a bank in Dakar, capital of Senegal with standing statement/agreement with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit contract must be sent to him through my humble chambers. Upon maturity, the routine notification was sent to me whom I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without no reply. After a month, I sent areminder which I received from the bank without any reply again.
Finally, I discovered from my client’s contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in the Kenya Airways flight of 31st January, 2000 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in Abidjan, Cote D’Ivoire. On further investigations, I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that Mr. Daniel Thorp did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Dakar-Senegal.
I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Senegalese law states that at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kinto Mr. Daniel Thorp so that the fruits of this old man’s labor will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal.
I wish to point out that after the claims, I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations, while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly, I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice.
If you are interested, please contact me via my email address :davidchambers@katamail.com. Upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us.

I am barrister David Clovis (Esq.), an English speaking Senegalese Solicitor & Financial Attorney/Consultant.I was the personal attorney to late Daniel Thorp who was an expatriate mining consultant/contractor with Teaser Petroleum Corporation in St Louis-Senegal.Mr. Daniel Thorp here-in-after referred as my client was also a Diamond/Gold Merchant.
Mr.Daniel Thorp made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only) in a bank in Dakar, capital of Senegal with standing statement/agreement with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit contract must be sent to him through my humble chambers. Upon maturity, the routine notification was sent to me whom I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without no reply. After a month, I sent areminder which I received from the bank without any reply again.
Finally, I discovered from my client’s contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in the Kenya Airways flight of 31st January, 2000 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in Abidjan, Cote D’Ivoire. On further investigations, I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I also discovered that Mr. Daniel Thorp did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Dakar-Senegal.
I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Senegalese law states that at the expiration of 5 (five) years the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kinto Mr. Daniel Thorp so that the fruits of this old man’s labor will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials. Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal.
I wish to point out that after the claims, I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations, while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us. Most importantly, I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice.
If you are interested, please contact me via my email address :davidchambers@katamail.com. Upon your response, I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us.
Awaiting your urgent reply via my email.
Thanks & Regards
Dr.David Clovis (Esq.)

I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense

Zimbabwe.This might be a suprise to you about where i got your contact 
address.Igot your address from a reliable source here in Johnnesburg ,South 
Africa in South African Information Exchange.
During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supporters 
of our President. Robert Mugabe to claim all the white -owned farms to his 
party members and his followers,he ordered all the  white farmers to 
surrender  all their farms to his party members and his followers.
My father being one of the few rich and successful black farmers in our 
country was also victimised because of his opposition to Mugabe's policies. 
And because he did not support Mugabe's ideas,Mugabe's supporters  invaded 
my fathers farm and burnt everything in the farm,killing my  father and  
made away with a  lot of items in my father's farm.
However with the benefit of hingsight, owing to the looming but 
deteriorating crisis in my country Zimbabwea,my  father had, before his 
unfurtunate death deposited with one of the Security Company in Johannesburg 
,  SOUTH AFRICA the  sum of US$18 Million (EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED DOLLARS 
)After the death of my father,we decided  to move to the Republic of  South 
Africa where he had deposited the money in the Security Company as 
valuables.
So I decided to contact overseas firms and individuals that will assist me 
to move this money out of  South Africa because, as asylum seekers we are 
not allowed to operate any bank accont within South Africa.We have agreed to 
offer 15% of the total sum for your assistance,5% will mapped out for any 
expenses that may be incurred  in the course of this transaction and 80% 
will be for me and my family to Invest in your country.
Please,I need the following clarifications from you:
1. Would taxation be much in your country as I desire a low/free tax zone.
2.What other lucrative businesses would you suggest as I intend Real 
Estate,tourism as well as industry and production or our farming business 
investments?.
3. What are your Government incentives to foreign investors in your 
locality?.
I am believing that you will be sincere enough and of good assistance to me 
in this issue

entire details including your readiness to assist me achieve this 
transaction for investment purposes in your country under your 
supervision.You can contact me on the above telephone or email address for

security company in Europe.The security company has liaison
offices in Asia and Uk & Europe.It was on September 20,
1998, that my client transferred the fund to the custodian
of the Security Company on hold for six years.
The exile situation coupled with the clamor for court
threat has placed my client under a precarious situation
thereby making it impossible for him or his family have
direct access to the fund. 
Consequently, my client is willing to offer you 20% of the
total fund,if you can assist him transfer this fund to your
country or any bank of your choice. He wishes to invest in
a stable economy.His interest is in companies with
potentials for rapid growth in long terms. Also, should

fund in your company, if your country?s bi-laws allows
foreign investment.

Mr. Adam Winpoe.
Bojanala House,
90 Protea Road,
Chislehurston,
Johannesburg
South Africa.
Email: adamwinpoe@web-mail.com.ar
Kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you.  Although we have never met before but I have every reason to believe that you are a highly respected personality, considering the fact that I sourced your profile from a human resource profile database on your country. Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it has formed insistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news bulletins, My name is Mr. Adam Winpoe from Liberia, a Country in West Africa. My Uncle is MR JOHN Y. WINPOE, former DEPUTY MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My uncle was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. 
You can verify this from your country. You can also check in some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:
http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-
Liberia_x.htmhttp://www.unwire.org/UNWire/20030716/449_6621.asp
Before he was killed, my uncle instructed me to escape with his family to a hide out in JOHANNESBOURG SOUTH AFRICA, and he confined on me that he left some money in a Diplomatic Trust Company in Abroad, (name withheld for security reasons) he handed me over a certificate meant for a secret Deposit, which he made in the Security Company. If you may ask why do I need a foreign assistance or why can't I take the cash transfer and myself? The answer is that there was an exclusion clause in the original agreement between the company and my uncle which states unambiguously that 'nobody, not even himself, can have access to the consignment in the company, and it has to  be transferred to a foreign beneficiary outside Africa. This was done because he envisaged   his arrest and this clause were inserted to prevent any seizure or infiltration of the fund.
My decision to contact you is therefore, informed by this and due to my present social status and total ignorance of the business world. I believe you will appreciate the enormity of trust I repose on you by placing the fortunes of our family in your care. Permit me to request that you should reassure me that you would not let me down in any way. On my part, this is my assurance and guarantee to you. In as much as you follow my instructions carefully, religiously and promptly my guarantee of a hitch-free success remains unshakable. I have contacted the Diplomatic Security Firm to confirm the deposit, which is worth $21.5Million,(Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars Only) which I presumed my uncle made from the purchase of arms and ammunitions for the Liberia Army.
You will be given 20% of the total sum at the end of the transaction. If you will be willing to assist us claim the money and invest it in your country. I want to assure you that all modalities are in place and it is a risk free transaction. Kindly confirm in your reply if you can come over to enable us conclude this transaction.
Kindly include your Private Telephone and Fax numbers where you can always be reach, Your Residential or Company Address to enable me send some other important information across to you.
This proposal is highly restricted and should be handled as an urgent transaction requiring trust and Confidentiality.
Thanks while looking forward to hearing from you urgently.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Mr. Adam Winpoe
For the Family.

Dear friend,
Greetings to you and your family! This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish and accept it with a deep sense of humility. 
My name is Jose Martinez Guzman. I am a 65 years old man, I am Cuban currently residing in Madrid (Spain). I was formerly living in Cuba and served under Castro`s government but had to run into self exile after the ruling Government of Fidel Castro closed in on my family on accusations of anti-government statements, I was once married with two children but my family could not escape before the deadly hands of Castro`s goons fell on them. 
l did made a lot of money serving Castro and on getting to Spain, I have been a merchant here in Madrid dealing in Ornamentals, Oriental Carpets and Artifacts and life was very smooth for me until about three(3) years ago when I was first diagnosed of Cancer of the Larynx.
Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived for, I never really cared about other values in life. But since the loss of my family and hometown, I have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in orphanage/motherless homes. I have once donated some money to orphans in war ravaged Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and some East European Countries. 
Before I became ill, I kept $US 5.5 Million in a long-term deposit vault of a bank and I didn`t state any next of kin when the money was deposited and if I died without stating any the money will automatically go into the coffers of the bank and I don`t want this to happen. I have left the hospital and presently receiving treatment in an acupuncture clinic, I have been undergoing treatment for Oesophageal Cancer at the hospital. I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. 
It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations, because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them.

Dear Beloved in Christ,
It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,knowing the truth and the truth have set me free.Having known the truth I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God´s mercy and glory upon my life.
I am Mrs Caroline Solange Haafkens from Netherlands.I am married to Dr.Franklyn Haafkens who worked with Chevron/Texaco in Nigeria for twenty years before he died in the year 2001.We were married for twenty-seven years without a child,He died during one of the riots in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.He was held hostage and slain to death by protesting youths of the region before his death we were both born again christians.
Since his death I decided not to re-marry.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of 8.6 million dollars (Eight Million six hundred thousand U.S.Dollars)with a bank in the Netherlands. Presently this money is still with the bank and the management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to receive the money or rather issue a 
letter of authorisation to somebody to receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.
I am presently with my laptop in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for cancer of the lungs, I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live.It is my last wish to see that this money is invested and at the end of every year distributed among charity organisation.
I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund churches,orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because i know that there are alot of poor people suffering from different kind of disease and nobody to come to their aid.With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank.I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the new beneficiary of this fund.You will be entitled to 10% of every profit you make in a year.
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.
I await your urgent reply.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs Caroline Haafkens

Hello,
It may come to you as a surprise hearing from me, but to be precise I
got your data from the your e-mail site member directory in my search
for a competent business manager/hard working person who is willing and able to be my friend and partner, to liaise with me in order to 
execute a project which I am convinced that you are capable and trusted to do this business with me.
I am Mark Luke, 32 years old and good looking man, and I am from River
State of Nigeria. I have B.SC in Public Administration and I work with
GLOBAL SECURITY & FINANCE LTD. I have now developed the interest in having a business investment outside Nigeria without my employers
knowing about it. Hence I contacted you for friendship and business
relationship.
The fund in question proposed for this project is US$14.8million
(Fourteen Million, Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars Only), which I will
like you to receive on my behalf and to invest it in your business or in
any business that you think will be profitable in your country.
Please Note: This fund came as a result of a multi-national company that
we helped to secure an oil drilling contract some years ago. Because of
our interest, the contract was over-invoiced to the above mentioned
amount and after the contract, the company received their actual
contract sum and went back to their country leaving behind this
over-inflated sum for me and my colleagues to claim.
Now the time has come for me to process and move the fund out for
investment, but I can not do it on my own since I am still working with
the Global Security & Finanace Ltd. This is why I need your help so that
I can use you or your company to process the release of the fund as if 
you are reciving a payment of an executed contract.
Please let me know about yourself/company and also let me know if you
can be able to receive the money on my behalf and invest it in your
company or any good and profitable business in your country without
exposing me, so that we can commence with the process of transfer. 
All you need to send immediately is your FULL NAMES or COMPANY NAME and your TELEPHONE/FAX NUMBERS
Your share will be 40% for your assistance, while I will take 55% and 5% will take care of any expenses that will be incurred in the cause of
transfer.
Please write back if only you know you are capable enough to execute
this project with me. Please this transaction requires utmost
confidentiality. My alternative Private email address is:

Looking forward to your cooperation.
Yours faithfully,
Mark Luke

Due to this crises presently in my city Monrovia our home town, I managed to sneak myself, my only son Patrick 23 years old and my daughters out of Monrovia to Dakar senegal for safety. We were sneaked into Dakar Senegal through the land boarder by the help of some government militant group.
After the killing of my husband by the rebels, we decided to come down here to Dakar senegal to secure the said deposit made in this country by my husband and to also look for a trust worthy individual abroad to receive the deposit which has being deposited here in Dakar Senegal before he was killed by the heartless rebels.
I feel confident therefore to introduce myself to you based on this problem and our present condition as all our foreign contacts and connections got lost during this crises, all properties burnt by the rebels. I am desperately in need to move and re-locate this huge deposit to your country for safe keeping as this is the only wealth remaining for the future survival and well being of my family.

So because of the condition in my country, I've not got the chance to go to Dakar-Senegal where these fund is deposited in Security Company Vault.But I've suceeded now with the very help of God and want to transfer these fund immediately for investment purpose.

by the rebels following the political uprising.
Before his death he deposited the sum of $14.5M fourteen Million five hundred
thousand USD in a private security Company in Europe which was for the importation
of cocoa processing machines. Note, according to my late husband the money
is in a trunk box and he did not disclose to the security company the real
content of the box he did it to reduce the cost of demurrage fees and for
the safety of the fund according to him, he declared to the security company
that the box contains a family valuables.
I want you to do me a favour, to help me invest this fund in a profitable
investment in your country as I do not have any knowledge of investment,
that will be after we retrieve it from the security company. For your efforts,
you shall either choose to receive 25% of the total fund or go into equal partnership
investment with me in your country. My interest is in areas, like real estate
and industrial production.

From Barr.Steve Nwa.
Attn: Sir/Madam.
I am Barrister Steve Nwa(SAN), a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to mrs. Ann Parker, a national of your country,. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On December 8, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mrs. Ann Parker. made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14.6,000,000.00(Fourteen Million, Six Hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to her forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month, I sent a reminder and finally i discovered from her contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mrs. Ann Parker. died from a ghastly automobile accident.
On further investigation, I found out that she died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace her next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mrs. Ann Parker. did not declare any next of kin or relations in all her official documents, including her Bank Deposit paperwork in her Bank. This sum of US$14.6,000,000.00 is still sitting in her Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim this fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mrs. Ann Parker. so that the fruits of this woman's labuor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.
I will drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/ administration in your favour for the transfer. I would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of kin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mrs. Ann Parker. to travel and claim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe which is used by her bank as an offshore payment center to the bank. The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you then 10% for any expensee that may come up. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by me with my position as Attorney guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply

Days before the death of my father he revealed to me

my name in a private security company in Accra, Ghana
for security reasons, although he registered the
contents as precious stones but the real content of
these trunk box is fhe sum of Eighteen Million
United States of American Dollars which was his share
from a secret sale of Diamond when he was in the
office, he could not deposit this funds in a financial
institution for fears of the funds being confiscated.
After the burial of my father, I made frantic effort
on the best way to handle this money. I sought advice
>from an attorney who advised that I must seek for a
trustworthy foreign business partner.
However, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get
this Funds out of this country, and your share for
assisting us will be fifteen percent of the total sum,

Dear Good Friend.
      I am Mrs Tina Williams from Solomon Islands. I am married to Mr. Lobi
Williams who worked with our Embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before
he died in the year 2001. We were married for eleven years without a child.
He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.
     Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death
I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which
the Bible is against.
    When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18.5 Million
with a Bank in Cote D lvoire. Presently this money is still in the custody
of the Bank in Cote D lvoire.
    Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight
months due to cancer problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate
this fund to a church,organization or
good person that will utilize this
money the way I am going to instruct herein.
    I want a church,organization or good person that will use this fund
for orphanages, widows and other peoples that needs help and also propagating
the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained.
   The Bible made us to understand that"Blessed is the hand that giveth".
l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this
money and my husband relatives are not Christians not even good at all because
they are the one that responsible for the death of my husband in other to
have all my late husband prperties and I don't want my husband's efforts
to be used by those that conspired for his death.
      This is why I am taking this decision, I am not afraid of death hence
I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of
Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that "the lord will fight my case and I shall
hold my peace".
     I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of
my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.
I don't want them to know about this development and l know that With God
all things are possible.
     As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the
Bank in Cote d' lvoire. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the
bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money. I also want
you, church or the organization to always pray for me because the lord is
my only shephard.
      My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever
that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please
always be prayerful all through your life.
Contact me on the
this email address and any delay in your reply will give
me room in sourcing another good person, church,organization for this same
purpose.
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.
Hoping to receive your response immedaitely.

Minister of finance who was assassinated for been
working with the ex-president Joseph .E in philippine.
I inherited a total sum of 20 million dollars from my
late husband, The presure from my decease husband's
family for this money has compelled me to leave Manila
and have the money which is concealed in a metallic
trunk box is deposited with a security and finance
company Cote d' ivoire under a secret arrangement as a
family treasure. 
This means that the security company does not know the
content of this box that was shipped from the
Philippine to Cote d' ivoire under a diplomatic
coverage. 
My purpose of asking for your assistance boil down to
the fact that I dno't want my late husband's family to
be aware or name involve. and the deposit statement of
the box authorized the company
to make this box
avaliable for shipment on request only to my foreign 
bussiness representative, though unname. 
Hence I want you to contact the the security company
as my bussiness partner, after receiving the prove
from me to enable the company release the  consigment
to you diplomatically, while I join you on the arrival
of the box. 
All you need do is to help me contact the security
company and introduce yourself as my bussiness partner
,requesting the shipment of the box. 
And as soon as Diplomatic shipping agent approved the
shipment and tell you the arrival date of the box then
I will join you to give you 15% of the money instantly
before I go on with the proposed investment in your
domain  provided is secured and investment friendly. 
Please if you are interested and willing to represent
me as my bussiness partner kindly write me as soon as
possible. 
I awaits your urgent response

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am Mr.Dougan .O.Oyony ,The son of the paramount 
late chief Moussambani.D. Oyony, of Litoral Province (Bata) in Equatorial Guinea.In African continent we are one of the smallest population in westren Africa, our natural resources is petroleum, natural gas, timber, gold, bauxite, diamonds, tantalum, sand and gravel,Guinea is the Oil and Diamond Richer in Africa, following by Angola and Sierra Leone and others Africa country.
My late father, his royal highness, chief Moussambani.D. Oyony, the 3rd oversaw the land redistribution and allocation of land, which has been ongoing since five years; and until his death, successfully allocated land for private, corporate as well as local individually for wide ranging uses which includes, farming, industry and manning.
However due to his untimely death in February 20th 2005, the process of land allocation has been other slow parcel.
The clout and influence my late father wielded in wooing potential investors to own community has suffered greatly due to his demise. By culture and tradition; I have to inherit the vacant chieftaincy title and 
other responsibilities that goes with it, but there must be a mourning period of one year following his death before I can assume the reigns. The proposal however is multifaceted; firstly, I have to kick start the other nonbound programmer of land allocation determine the suitability of interested applicants etc.
Our community is rich in minerals such as gold and platinum and rough diamonds. Presently, there are three unused mines totally under my control which has been confirmed to hold great deposits of gold and 
platinum. 
I wish to go into business with foreign partners who would obviously play great roles in extracting those minerals presently, I have in my possessions a very significant amount of diamond (uncut) gold and platinum which are available for inspection and verification; but I greatly 
solidify a trusted foreign partner who can help in transporting these minerals with great discretion for our mutual benefits, to countries overseas.
Hence my decision to send you this letter with intention, trusting that you would see the great business opportunities there in; however due to the sensitive nature and scrutinous controls with these precious 
metals, I am trusting that this transaction would be treated with utmost confidentiality between us.
For more details and precise information regarding how this deal can be exploited, you may contact me on this e mail+ moussambani2@webmail.co.za, 
And I shall forward to you important documents regarding all I said in this letter.
I shall await your response as I urge you to seriously and urgently consider this request .Here is thanking you very much for your time.
Yours sincerely,

during the period of our marriage we couldn�t produce any child.my late 
husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business 
and wealth. The doctors has advised me that I may not live for More than six 
months, so I now decided to divide the part of this wealth, to contribute to 
the development of the church in Africa, America Asia, and Europe. i prayed

My Dear:
First,I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this by virtue if 
its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOPSECRET.Though I know that a  
transaction of this magnitude will make  any one apprehensive and worried, 
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I am 
barrister Kofi Kosombo,solicitor at law.I am the personal attorney to Mr  
Paul Hamp , a national of your country,who was in contract with shell 
development company in Nigeria.On the 21st of April 1999,my client,his wife 
And their three Children were involved in  a caraccident along sagbama 
express road.
All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I 
have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients 
extended relatives  this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several 
unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the Internet, 
to locate any member of his family  hence I contacted you. I have contacted 
you to assist in retrieving the sum of US$10m deposited in a security 
company by my client before it get'sconfisicated because the security 
company doesn't know that the content of the consignment is cash because on 
the day of deposite we declared it as family valuables because we never want 
them to know the true content of the consignment.
The security company has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or 
have the consignment confisicated within the next two weeks and these very 
money is too  big for me to allow it to beconfisicated by the authority. 
Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2 
years now I seek your consent to  present you as the next of kin of the 
deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds of this 
consignment valued at 10million dollars can be released to you and then you 
and me can share the money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all necessary 
legal documents that can be used to back the claim.
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. 
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law. I am not imposing this 
transaction on you,It is a thing of self  willing ness,so it is either you 
write me back and tell me you are willing and I will know the next step to 
take because this fund must be claimed either with your help  or the help of 
somebody else. After going through the proposal and under standing it very 
well and you are willing to do this transaction with me,get back to me 
immediately so that we can start as follows:
1)I will send to you the contact of the security company,the deposite code, 
for you to call for verification if such deposite is really existing.
2)The claim will require both of our physical presentation at the security 
company. With constant communication it will not take us more than seven 
working days to achieve our aim.
It is a promise that at the end of the day you will embrace me and we will 
become one family friends for life as I was with my late client.  Your 
private telephone is also needed in reponse to this proposal for oral 
discussions and better understanding.
While I wait for your reply.
Best Regard
Koffi Kosombo.PLEASE CAN YOU ASSIST?

INTRODUCTION OF MYSELF:
As a personal treasurer to him, authority was handed over to me to transfer 
some money to an American oil merchant for his last oil deal with my boss 
Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
Already the funds have left the shore of Russia to a European private Bank 
where the final crediting is expected to be carried out. While I was on the 
process, My Boss got arrested for his Involvement in politics by financing 
the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, Led 
by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party Led by 
Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses a treat to President Vladimir Putin's Second 
Tenure as Russian president.

YOUR ROLE:
All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted Sum 
and I will re-profile the funds with your name, which will enable the 
European bank transfer the sum to you with the aid of a Security firm in 
London. The transaction has to be concluded before Mikhail Khodorkovsky is 
out on bail. As Soon as I confirm your readiness to conclude the transaction 
with me, I will provide you with the details.

Dear Sir,
You may be surprised to receive my letter, however, I got your contact As a 
result of my desperate desire for assistance, and though this mail is 
Unsolicited I pray you be humane to consider it. I have decided to contact 
you for confidential, urgent and rewarding joint business.
My name is Dr.Paul Osadebe; I am from the Federal Republic of Nigeria and 
the chairman, Contract Award Committee of Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC). I have been on this position for the past ten years; but 
I have nothing to show for it. I will love it, if the both of us could do 
business together, which will be of mutual benefit.
Since I am the Chairman Contract Award Committee, I will award a Forty 
million US dollars ($40 million USD) contract in your favour to supply Gas 
Turbines and equipments. A Mobilization (up front) fee of twenty million U.S 
Dollars ($20 million USD) will be given to you to start the supply. But as 
soon as the mobilization fees gets to your hands, you are not going to do 
the supply. You and myself will share this mobilization fee on a 50-50 basis 
(Equally). The reason why I want us to share this start up fee is because I 
have been in this Position as the chairman for the past ten years, and I 
don稚 have a personal house of my own, my salary is a peanut. I cannot 
adequately take care of my children. In fact, things are very difficult for 
me. If I retire, I will have nothing to fall back on. People come sometimes 
to seek for favour from me and after awarding them contracts; they値l not 
remember me again.
A lot of people promised and failed me. As a result of this, I want to help 
my self this time because I値l not want to die a poor man. If we do this 
business Together, with your full co-operation and support, we will 
successfully complete it within five days. I am the person who will 
authorize the release the start up fee to you.
You have nothing to fear. I want you to remove anything like fear from your 
mind. This is the safest business you can ever think of. I will give you 
more information on how we are going to do this business as soon as I 
receive your reply showing that you are ready to do the business with me. 
But please do not discuss this business with anybody, even your best friends 
until we have finished successfully.
I will want you to reply me immediately so that I can tell you the next step 
to take. In your reply, please include your full names, address, and private 
telephone /

Greetings, 
My name is RABI AL SALIH, wife of MAHAMMED MAHDI AL SALIH, the former Iraqi minister for Interior Affairs. I got your email address through the internet while searching for a reliable person to help me and I believe you can be able to help me and my family.
My husband was captured on 23 April 2003 by the US forces. My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of terrorism, corruption, embezzlement and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. During my husband's regime as Minister for Interior, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now. 
Before the US invaded our nation, I secretly siphoned the sum of $12,000,000 million USD out of Iraq and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold belonging to my foreign business partner. I am contacting you because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. 
I trust you as a reliable person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. when I receive your positve response I will give you all the necessary informations to enable you proceed to the security company and claim the money. I shall also let you know where the security company is and the consignment pin code to claim the consignment, which is very important. I assure you 100% safety and success once you follow my instructions.
For now, let all our communication be by e-mail because my line are tight now connected to the US Forces Telecomunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. I will give more details when I receive your reply.
Yours Sincerely,
Rabi.

Dear sir,
I am MR, TEMA WILLIAMS, the son of late
MR.PATRICK WILLIAMS, who was murdered in a land dispute
in ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for
reliable & compitent foreigner to handle a confidential
financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My
late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich
farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the
ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his
alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition
party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South
Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars
($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he
knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was
deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much
dumourage from the security firm.
This money was earmarked for the purchase of new
machinery and chemicals for the farms and the
establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.
This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE
introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the
White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently
condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the
government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob
actions. I and my family who are currently staying in South
Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided
to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the
Trunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher
transfer of the money to a foreign country where we
can invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of
claiming/investing this amount of money in South
Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in
future since both countries have the same political
history. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law
does not allow such investment hence I am seeking for
an asylum or refugee.
I must let you know that this business is 100% risk
free and the nature of your business does not
necessary matter. So if you are willing to assist us
claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have
agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will be
for a joint business venture I will be doing with you
and another 35% will be for me and my family which we
shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%
will be mapped out for all expenses we may incure
during the transaction.
Therefor, if you are willing and interested to render
the needed assistance. Please funish me your private
phone and Fax number for easy and better communication.
Remember that this is highly confidential and the
success of this business depends on how secret it is kept.
PLEASE KINDLY REPLY TO : temawilliams172@webmail.co.za
Expecting your reply soonest.
Best Regard.
