<a href="http://www.quick-responder.com/ar/subconf.php?id=861519&tkn=8LAmkGom&m=1">AOL Users Click Here</a>Dear friend,
I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY 
FACTS OR OPINION EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN
CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
AND USE. 
I am MR. Thomas Sarr, the manager of bill and exchange
at the foreign remittance department of my  Bank. In
my department I discovered an abandoned sum of
US$8.5m,(Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US  
Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs
to one of our  foreign customers who died along with
his wife and only daughter in a plane 
crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which
crashed on 31 January, 2000. You shall read more about
the crash on visiting this site  
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/
The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an
American and great industrialist and a resident of
Alaska. 
It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided
to make this business proposal to you and for our bank
to release the money to you. You have to follow the
instructions which I will send to you as the next of
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it
and I don't want this money to go into 
our bank treasury as  unclaimed  bill. 
The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if
such money remained unclaimed after three years, the 
money will be transfered into the bank treasury as
unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than 
three years and I am preparing documentations to prove
that this money has been transfered to our bank
treasury. It will be between me and you only that will
know that the money is not transfered into our
treasury. The request of foreigner as next of kin in
this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the
customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand
as next of kin to a foreigner. 
In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you
30% of the total sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of
transfer/other charges) likely to  be incurred during
the course of transaction, while the remaining 65% 
is  for me. 
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax
or email the text of the application which you will
complete and forward to our bank asking for this money
to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris
Thomson. I will not fail to bring to your notice that
this transaction is hitch-free and that you should not
entertain any fear as all required arrangements have
been made for the transfer. You should contact me
immediately as soon as you receive this mail through
the above email.
PLEASE DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY.
PLEASE DO CONSIDER MY REQUEST AS URGENT. 
You may contact me also at sarrthom1@lycos.com.
Yours  Faithfully,
Thomas SARRAcknowledge Receipt

LILIAN THOMAS
12 BP 1046 ABIDJAN.
COTE D'IVORIE.
Dearest one,
Permit me to inform you of my desire to go into business relationship with you , l got your name and contact through the internet here in Abidjan and I prayed over it and selected your name among other names due to the nature of my proposal,which requires a reputable and trustworthy person. Someone who will be kind and sincere to me.
l am Miss Lilian Thomas, the only daughter of late Mr and Mrs Nelson Thomas.My father was a very wealthy cocoa merchant in Abidjan here, the economic capital of Ivory Coast, he was poisoned to death by his business associates on one of their business meeting. My mother died on the 20th october 1988 and my father took me so special because l am motherless. 
Before the death of my father on 29th november 2003 in a private hospital here in Abidjan, he secretly called me on his bedside,when I sat down to listen to him, he started crying, why? (1) He complained that I am too young to be managing my life with no one to take care of me,(2)That I have not finished my university education as he planned for me, he revealed to me that he has a sum of US$8.400.000.(EIGHT MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) left in a security company here in Abidjan, that he used my name as the only daughter for his next of kin in deposit of the funds. 
He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisioned by his business associates , that l should seek for a GOD fearing foreign partner in a country of my choice where l will transfer this money and use it for proper investment purpose ,that I must finish my university education by the help of a business partner abroad,that he or she should help me obtain a resident permit in his or her country.He also gave a standing instrution to the company that the
deposit must be transferred outside this country. According to my father,the money was deposited as art works to avoid attracting attention to the deposit. 
Sir, I am now ready to do all these since my father my bread winner is no more. Sir l am honourable seeking your assistance in the following ways. 
(1) To serve as my guardian in your country while I will depend on your expert advise since l am a girl of 23 years.
(2) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country in order to further my university education and to secure a residential permit for me in your country.
Moreover sir, l am willing to offer you 15% of the total sum as compensation for your assistance in the transfer of this deposit to your country. Furthermore, you can indicate your option towards assisting me as l believed that this project would be concluded within seven days you signify interest to assist me by contacting the security company. 
Hoping to hearing from you soon. May God bless you as you extend your helping hand to the needy.
Best wishes
Lilian Thomas.

From: Mrs. Helen  Walter. 
Hello this letter might come to you as a surprise since, we have not had any previous correspondence or meet. i need your help. As a reliable one and trustworthy person that can help  i saw your information on internet and i am really interested in you.
I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment in London, England. I am married to Dr. Jim Walter who worked with British Railway Commission in Chelsea England for over a decade before he died on 5th of July in the year 2003. We were married for fifteen years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for two weeks.  
Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of £1 Million (One Million Pounds sterling) in a Vault
with a Security company in JAPAN.  Presently, this money is still  there. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 30 days due to cancer problem.Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. 
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an individual or better still a God fearing person who will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct . I want an individual that will use this fund and provide succor to poor and indigent persons, orphanages, and above all those affected in the Tsunami in far Asia.and  you
I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not inclined to helping poor persons and I do not want my husbands hard earned money to be misused or spent in the manner in which my late husband did not specify. I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner,
hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. 
I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Almighty.  I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, .With God all things are possible.
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Security company in JAPAN. 
I want you to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein. Hoping to hear from you.
Thank you and may the Almighty bless you.pls Reply me to helen_waiter@yahoo.com
Yours sincerely, 
Mrs.Helen Walter Anne

Re Urgent Assistance
Kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself. I am KEN GREEN KABILA,the
son of the former head of state/ president of Congo-Kinshasha (then called
Zaire) Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila.
I am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on this confidential
Business proposal with full financial benefit for both of us.
Before I go into further details please be informed that I am writing without
any other person(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this transaction.
Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.
I have the sum of USD55Million from a secret sale of Diamond by my father
before he was assassinated by one of his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th
2001, which I will like you to receive on my behalf due to security reasons,as
my narration below will explain. But before I continue b e well informed that
your share in this transaction has been calculated at 15% of the total sum of
USD$55M, 5% for expenses and the rest for my family and me.
My father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having
married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my father, My step
brother Joseph, who is the current president of my country, is the son of the
first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.
Already president Joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and
private property, which my father left behind for the whole family. Now my
mother and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late father's
wealth. Our situation is seriously critical that we need your assistance to help
us receive these funds overseas for proper investment.
Let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction because the
diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pa ttern that shows no direct
trace or linkage with us (Kabi! la family). At present the money is in cash and is
secured in a financial institution company as consignment.
The consignment will be released within seven (7) days of my being in receipt
of your reply via my email address above only for security reasons.
I am waiting for your swift and favorable response, and in case you have any
question(s), do not hesitate to contact me.my alternative email is ken_kabil40@zwallet.com
you can call me mmediately on my private phone number which is :229-988-039.

Dear sir
I wish to solicit your help in migrating to your
country and investing my funds.
Briefly, I am a Sierra Leonean National and the wife
of late Dr SIMON LAMINE.
Until his death, my husband was the General overseer
of the Diamond and Gold Mining Corporation in Kanema,
Sierra Leone. On April 6 2000 the military forces
loyal to the Government of Ahmed TIJAN KABBAH invaded
the Diamond and Gold mine and assassinated my husband,
mistaking him for his brother MIKE LAMINE who is the
deputy to the leader of the revolutionary United
Front (RUF ) FODAY SANKOH.
When the news reached me, I hurried gathered some
valuables in our family villa and escaped for my dear
life in the company of my only son PETERS.
Among the valuables was a file that contained details
of a Deposit my husband made in a security company in
Europe. He deposited US$ 15.5 M  contained
in 1 Trunk Box in the name of our son PETERS as
containing family valuables. He did not disclose the
real contents of the box to the security company.
Rather, he declared the deposit as Family Valuables
for security reasons. This is the money he made from
the sale of Gold and diamonds during his time as the
General overseer.
We need your sincere assistance to move this funds out from the 
security
company IN EUROPE for investment
in your country as we cannot invest here due to its
nearess to our country and the war still going on
there. Besides, our Refugee Status here cannot help
matters for us. We also ask you to scout for a viable
and lucrative business, so that we can invest wisely.
We have it in mind to give your 30 % of the total sum
(15.5 million US Dollars), and 20% share in any
investment we will embark upon if you assist us. We
will also set aside 5% of the funds for ancillary
expenses which you will make in course of this
transaction- air tickets and handling expenses etc.
This fortune we have revealed to you should remain
confidential as it only you who we have told about it.
pleaselet me have your phone/fax numbers for more detials.
Note that this transaction is risk free.
May God Bless you as you assist us.
Yours Sincerely ,
MRS ELISABETH / PETERS LAMINE

I am Mr Chuks Anthony, the financial Controller and Contract Award Committee Chairman
in the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) in Lagos, Nigeria. My colleagues have
assigned me to seek for assistance of a reliable foreigner through whom we can transfer the
sum of US $65,500,000.00 (sixty Five Million, five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) which
arose from deliberate over- inflated contract value for the General expansion of the Kanji
Dam Thermal Station on behalf of National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) for increased
energy generation to Nigeria and some other West African Countries. The Contract was
awarded in 1998 during the late General Sanni Abacha regime to an expatriate firm with the
consideration of 10% commission agreement on the total contract value. The contract has
been completed and the contractor has long been paid, we are now left with this
US$65,500,000.00 representing the 10% our own share as agreed presently in the Federal
Government account. The favorable political/economic climate in this country now presented
an opportunity for this money to be transferred out of the country. I got your contact from a
commercial attached to your emabassy. This assurance gave me courage to link you up for
this particular transaction, and I hope it will be of mutual benefit to all of us. Our contact in
the Federal Ministry of Finance have given us a go a head advice to begin the process of the
remittance, hence we have set in motion the machinery for the take off of the transaction and
further action will commence immediately we hear from you. We have agreed that after the
transfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 30% of the total amount
transferred, 10% for incidental expenses from you and us, while the remaining 60% will be
for us. We decided to give you this percentage in order to motivate you and also to let you
feel satisfied at the end of this transaction. The nature of your business is not particularly
relevant for the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to co-operate
and assurance that our own share will be given to us when this money is transferred into your
account. All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a no risk situation on the sides
of both parties and it is believed that the conclusion of this transaction will not last more than
fourteen (14) working days. However, we are going to retrieve the whole documents that will
be related to this transaction so that both parties will be protected after the transfer of the
money into your account. Since we have no knowledge of business, our plan is to invest this
money into Real Estate, Stocks and we can also invest in some other profitable business in
your country based on your advice because many of our years has been spent as Civil
Servant, and we may likely resign from government service to private businesses after this
money is transferred into your Account. Please note that this business is strictly confidential
and must not be disclosed to a third party. This is necessary to avoid disclosure that may
jeopardize the transaction. Finally, if this proposal is acceptable to you or if you have any
questions, feel free to contact me on the above E-mail address. You should also send to me
your private telephone / fax numbers and E-mail address for easy and confidential
communication. I will oblige you with further information if so required. Please reply this

Dear Friend,
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is 
necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your 
indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR Ademola Williams 
of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, 
may his soul rest in peace.
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my 
country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five 
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the 
rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one 
of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in 
Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being 
threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi 
Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other 
Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.In 
view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist 
us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a 
security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the 
Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through 
normal custom/airport screening and clearance.friends (western countries) who 
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President 
Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor 
met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in 
your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, 
this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge 
success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires 
a total confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund 
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your 
telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost 
indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your 
Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and GodBless.

to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five 
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the 
rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one 
of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in 
Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being 
threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi 
Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other 
Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.In 
view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist 
us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a 
security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the 
Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through 
normal custom/airport screening and clearance.friends (western countries) who 
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President 
Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor 
met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in 
your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, 
this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge 
success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires 
a total confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund 
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your 
telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost 
indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your 
Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and GodBless.

Vasil NanchevPROPOSAL
URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
Kindly allow me
the modesty of introducing myself. I 
am Gregory Kabila, the son of the
former head of state 
president of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zaire) Mr.
Laurent Desire Kabila. 
I am contacting you in order to ask for your
assistance 
on this confidential Business proposal with full financial 
benefit for both of us. 
Before I go into further details please be
informed 
that I am writing without any other person(s) 
pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this 
transaction. Therefore I
will appreciate same attitude 
to be maintained all through. 
I have
the sum of USD48Million from a secret sale of 
Diamond by my father before
he was assassinated by one 
of his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th
2001, which 
I will like you to receive on my behalf due to 
security
reasons, as my narration below will explain. 
But before I continue be
well informed that your share 
in this transaction has been calculated at
25% of the 
total sum of USD$48M, 5% for expenses and the rest for 
my family and me. 
My father as a real African traditionalist was a 
polygamist thereby having married so many wives, and 
my mother being
the second wife of my father, My 
stepbrother Joseph, who is the current
president of my 
country, is the son of the first wife and he does not 
have any knowledge about this deal. 
Already president Joseph is using
his power to 
colonize all the money and private property, which my 
father left behind for the whole family. Now my mother 
and I are left
with nothing in the inheritance of my 
late father’s wealth. Our situation
is seriously 
critical that we need your assistance to help us 
receive these funds overseas for proper investment. 
Let me quickly
assure you the 100% safe proof of this 
transaction because the diamond
sales are packaged 
from the onset in a pattern that shows no direct trace
or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the 
money is in cash
and is secured in a security company 
as family treasures, as I don’t want
to deposit the 
money in a financial institution for fear of the funds 
being confiscated 
The consignment will be released within seven (7)
days 
of my being in receipt of your reply via my email 
address
above only for security reasons. 
I am waiting for your swift and
favorable response, 
and in case you have any question(s), do not hesitate
to contact me. 
Best Regards, 
Gregory Kabila. 
NB:ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ADDRESS(gregorykabila222@post.cz) 
http://www.femalelife.bgKINDLY TREAT
Dear Prospective Partner,
Accept my compliments. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, I ask that you give due consideration to its importance, as we both stand to benefit immensely. Though we have not met or know each other, this is a criterion I have used to select you, as I wish to cut off all ties with my people for security and safety reasons.
I am a stepson and personal aide to the Late General Robert Guei of blessed memory, former President of Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast).
You may not be conversant with the present situation in my country, which has gradually degenerated into a civil war. On September 19, 2002, My Dad led a failed coup d'etat against President Laurent Gbagbo, in a bid to restore political stability in my country. Unfortunately, he was killed. After my Dad's death, there was confusion and power struggle in our camp; this led to an insurgence of several factions and has left no hope for peace anytime nearby.  To understand more on the situation click on this link http://www.state.gov/p/af/rls/rm/17657.htm
I decided to flee my country, as I desired a peaceful life, and I no more had interest in conflicts and wars.
To the point, the essence of my contact with you is to seek your most needed assistance to siphon US$18,500,000 left in the bunker of my Dad’s Private Palace. Only my Dad and me knew about this fund. Now that my Dad is dead, I intend to use this money for my personal benefit (as well as yours if you accept to be my partner). I see justification in diverting the money, rather using it to support the purchase of weapons for destruction of innocent lives and properties.
This money has been moved in cash in a trunk to my present location in Europe through diplomatic means. I plan to invest this money in diversified projects, and relocate to a private location. As you can understand, the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order have my plans achieved in the shortest possible time. When the trunk is claimed, we shall firstly have the money deposited into an Offshore account in your name, as I am being discrete of using my name for now. Then you shall have your own share withdrawn to an account of your choice, and leave the rest as fixed deposit, for release to me at the appropriate time for the investments and my relocation.
Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. Be informed that I am confiding in you by disclosing all this information to you, hence it is only me (apparently you now) that have knowledge of this. The importance of prosecuting this within the next few days cannot be overlooked; hence your immediate response will be highly appreciated.
If you accept to assist me, for your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money.
On hearing from you, I shall disclose my location to you, and explain details of your role in this. Furthermore, everything regarding this process will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed in a very short while, depending on your prompt response.
I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.
Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.
Sincerely,JEWEL TAYLOR
    With all sincerity and humility i am Jewel Taylor,the third 
    wife of the deposed President of Liberia, the African

www.freeserve.com/anytimeFrom: Mrs. Susan Shabangu.
Greetings to you,
With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings,
and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However
strange or surprising this contact might seem to you
as we have not met personally or had any dealings in
the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration
of its importance and the immense benefit it will be
to you.
After careful consideration with my children, we
resolved to contact you for your most needed
assistance in this manner. I duly apologize 
for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not
acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a
person of integrity.
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly
to you. My name is Mrs. Susan Shabangu, mother of
three and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy 
of The Republic of South Africa for seven years 
running as you will find in the link 
below: http://www.gov.za/gol/gcis_profile.jsp?id=1066 
I will now give you a general overview of the
situation. When I was sworn in as Deputy Minister of
Minerals and Energy in 1996, with my influence, my
husband Mr. Ndelebe Simon Shabangu a very successful
businessman was awarded several contracts in my
ministry and had direct dealings with foreign
investors in this field. Due to my political
status, I was not involved in my husbands business
which was very vast and successful. My beloved husband
died whilst on an official trip to Trinidad 
and Tobago in February 2001.
When my husband died, I was contacted as next of kin
by a private security firm in Europe to come forth
with the Certificate of Deposit and claim a safety
deposit my husband has in their Vault in his name. At 
that time, my children and I did not have an idea
where the Certificate might be. We then instructed the
security firm to continue holding the safety deposit
until further instructions from me. Whilst preparing
for the second remembrance of my beloved husband, I
was going through his library collection and to my
astonishment I discovered a Certificate 
of Deposit for the safety deposit with this private
security firm, and other documents relating to the
safety deposit in a book. The safety deposit
which is a trunk, is stocked with hard currency (US
Dollars) totalling $10,000,000 which was generated
from cash payments from his business associates in the
diamond trade from Antwerp, Belgium.
Though I knew my late husband was in the diamond
business, I did not have the knowledge that he moved
funds in cash. This has came as a shock to me and my
children, and we have decided to have this fund
invested immediately in commercial and residential
properties abroad as well as profitable ventures, as
any member of my family cannot hold such a huge
amount in our name due to my political status, hence
we sincerely propose to you to render us your most
needed assistance in this regard.
If you agree to render us your assistance, your role
in this project will be to act on my behalf as a
trustee to receive the safety deposit containing the
funds from the Security firm. Though I believe this
transaction should be based on mutuality, my family's
interest will be protected by a family associate, who
is a lawyer(attorney) attached to the South
African Embassy in the country where the security firm
is located. He is now aware of the safety deposit, and
I have informed him that I am locating one of my
husband's business associates (you) to handle the
funds and invest on our behalf, as he might be opposed
to our decision if he found out 
that I barely know you.
For your reliable assistance, we are offering you 20
% of the funds. I thank you in advance as
we anticipate your assistance in enabling us
achieve this goal. On hearing from you, I will forward
your contact to the gentleman lawyer who will be
representing us, and also give you his
contact for both of you to communicate and proceed
with the transaction. 
He will be working with you for a mutual conclusion of
the process and I look forward to a long lasting
business relationship with you. As you may 
understand, due to my sensitive position in the
present government, it is not safe to communicate with
me via phone or fax. 
This is why I have communicated with you with my
private email address, and I like us to keep this way,
for the safety of this transaction.
whether or not you are interested in assisting us 
please let us know.This will enable us make 
alternative plans, in the event of non-interest
on your part.
With warm regards,
Mrs. S. Shabangu.FROM  MONICA

ATTN: Sir, 
My name is Mrs.Monica Martins, the wife of late Mr.Zulu
Martins, of Zimbabwe. It might be a surprise to you where I
got your contact address I got it from the net.I am using
this opportunity to express my predicaments to you
During the current crises against the farmers of Zimbabwe
by the supporters of our President ROBERT MUGABE to claim
all the white owned farms in our country, he 
ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to
his party members and their followers. 
My husband was one of the best farmers in the country and
knowing that he did not support the president's political
ideology, the president's supporters invaded my husband's
farm, burnt down everything, shot him and as a result of
the wounds sustained, he became sick and died after two
days. And after his death I became a widow over night with
my only son (Frank Martins) and one daughter (Russ) decided
to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives to
South Africa. Before he died, he wrote his 'WILL' which
reads:
'MY BELOVEED SON (Frank) I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO
THE SUM OF 
US$20.7 MILLION U.S DOLLARS WHICH I DEPOSITED IN A BOX WITH
A SECURITY COMPANY IN JOHANNESBURG (SOUTH-AFRICA) IN CASE
OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH CAUSED BY DEATH ONLY' 
you should solicit for reliable foreign partner to assist
you to transfer this money out of SOUTH-AFRICA for the
family care and investment purposes I deposited the money
in your  name(Frank Martins)and it can be claimed by you
with the help of a foreign partner using the deposit
code.Your mother has all the documents.Take good care of
your mother and your sister.
>From the above you will understand that the lives and
future of my family depends on this money as much as I will
be very grateful if you can assist us. We are now living in
South-Africa as POLITICAL ASYLUM SEEKERS and the financial
law of SOUTH-AFRICA do not allow an ASYLUM SEEKER any
financial right to operate such huge amount of money .In
view of this I cannot invest this money in South-Africa
hence I am asking you to assist us transfer this money out
of South-Africa for investment purposes. 
[1]. For your efforts I am prepared to offer you 30% of the
total fund while 70% will be kept for my family and I for
investments.Immediately we establish trust within our
selves, I would go ahead to give you all the details you
might require to know about this fund.

BEST REGARDS, 
MRS MONICA MARTINS.
(FOR THE FAMILYHello From Micheal !!!!! .
Good day!!.
Compliments of the day and my best wishes to you and family!!!.
I know this letter will come to you surprisingly but let it not be a surprise to you, for nature has a way of arriving unannouced and an adage says 'originals are very hard to find but their echo sounds louder'. So, I decided to contact you myself for you to assure me of safety and honesty if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody.
I am Mr Micheal Bangura, the son of late Mr Thaimu Bangura who was the minister of finance in Sierra leone but was killed during the civil war. Knowing your country as being economical condusive for investment and your people as transperant and trustworthy to engage in business on which premise I write you.
Before my father death, he had the sum of twenty-three million united states dollars(us$23,000,000.00) which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war and deposited it in a security company for saftey and safe-keeping. this fund was supposed to be used for rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country before the outbreak of war. when the war broke out, the rebel leader demanded that this fund be given to him, my father insisted that the money was not in his possesion but he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
Meanwhile my mother and i is the only person who knows about this fund,because my father always confide in me since i am the only child in the family.When my father was killed,I quickly made an arrangemnt with a red cross rellief worker who used his official van to move me and my mother to lungi airport in freetownfor our safety because the rebels also wanted to kill us too.
The fund was deposited by my late father as a family inheritance with a safe relaible security company in Dakar senegel where I was only given temporary asylum with my mother.I do not want to invest this money in senegel due to unfavourable economic climate and so close to my country. Also, I still kept this money also for security reasons as the present administration is investigating the existence of such fund of which I denied knowledge of it, claiming that my father did not tell me about such money. The only assistance I need from you which i believe you would do for me are the following:
1.Assist me invest this money in your country when it is release to you on our behalf by the security company.
2.Assure me that you will not sit on my share when this fund gets to your country.
You will have 15% of the money for yourself as you guide me further to invest the remaining 80% in any valueble business venture while 5% is earmarked to cover expenses contingencies.
Most importantly, i will like to buy a personal house where i and my mother will reside.Upon confirmation of your interest to help me as my foreign partner to invest this money, i will link you the details of this
transaction to be scheduled in your favo ur by the security company.
While thanking you for your anticipated understanding and cooperation, I look forward to your urgent response.
please note that this transaction is strictly confidential and must be treated with utmost secrecy.

Mr. Micheal Bangura.

Dear Sir, 
ACT ACCORDINGLY AND PRIVATELY 
I am Evans Timothy the bills and exchange director at African Express 
Bank Plc.
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has 
been taken care of and all will be well at the end of the day. I 
decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.
MY PROPOSITION;
I am writing this letter to solicit for support and assistance from you 
to carry out this business opportunity in my department.Lying in an 
inactive account awaiting liquidation is the sum of USD $10.7million 
belonging to a foreign customer(Herve Garboudes) who was an 
petroleum/gas consultant/contactor with the Nigeria National Petroleum 
coporation who happens to be deceased during a business trip. He died 
with his wife
(Christine Garboudes) on board the Swissair Flight 111 , which crashed 
into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia in september 2nd 1998. 
The news of this crash was on the news which we have notified his 
relatives to no avail.
See links below for more detail informaion: 
http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/ 
http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/
http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/05/swissair.transcript
Ever since he died the bank has been expecting his next of kin to come 
and claim these fund, the NDIC could not liquidate the account because 
I have filled a motion that a next of kin wrote in to the effect. To 
this effect, they can not release the money unless someone applies for 
it as next of kin, as indicated in our banking guideline. 
At this juncture i have decided to do business with you in 
collaboration with some officials in the bank, to this effect we 
solicit your assistance in applying as the next of kin and beneficiary 
to Herve Garboudes then the money will be released to you. As we do not 
want this money to go into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill,or 
our superiors taking the funds for their own personal use.
The banking law and guideline stipulates that if such money(s) remains 
unclaimed for a period of up to seven years(7yrs) the money will be 
transferred into the banks treasury as an unclaimed bill. Our request 
for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the 
customer was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as next of kin. To 
effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed, you must 
apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the decease, The fund 
shall then be transferred to you legally in accordance to all laid down 
procedures governing closure of account and transfer of funds. 
If you are willing to assist us, we have agree to give you 20 Percent 
of USD $10.7 million  
Note that this transaction is legal,safe and 100% risk free.
Upon receipt of your reply which should includes the following:
1) Your Full Name 
2) Your telephone number for easy communication between us.
I will confidentially work out all modalities for the successful 
transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary, and send to you by 
fax or email attachement the text of the application, as soon as you 
receive the text I will further clarify you in details on how to effect 
the business. 
Await to hear from you 
Best Regards 
Evans Timothy.Message from Ata, pls give me a hand.
Dear Friend,
I am Ata Yusuf 24 years of age, from Darfur, Sudan, the only surviving Son of the family of Ibrahim Yusuf who was a civil engineer before his death in May 21, 2004 as a result of the crisis in Darfur, Western Sudan. You can read more about the crisis in Dafur, Sudan by click on this weblink; http://www.savedarfur.org/. This unforgettable incident claimed the lives of my parents while my sisters and I were in school, as such we have been in a refugee camp since the death of our parents before a kind hearted woman took me to London, Uk where I have currently seek asylum. As such I am in great need of help now because I need to move my sisters out of the refugee camp back home in Sudan, to settle down with me here in London. 
I am writing you now because I need you to help me claim the funds my father deposited in a security and finance company in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He deposited the sum of $3.8million us dollars (three million and eight hundred thousand united states dollars) in this security and finance company which I discovered shortly before leaving my country for Uk. I have the relevant document that will be require for the claim of the funds but my problem now is that I am not in the position to handle such huge amount of money here because of my immigration status. It might interest you to know that I have already establish communication with the security company to claim the funds as the heir of my family, unfortunately that is just all I can do by myself for now. As a result, In a nut shell i need you to help me remit the funds from the security company on my behalf, I am sure it will not take too much of your time because I have everything that will facilitate the quick release of the funds to you.
I am counting on you to help me in most sincerity and not to take undue advantage of my present situation as I will be basically entrusting you with these funds. Once you get the funds, you have to send me some money that will be enough for my sisters to arrange for their traveling documents to come over to London to join me. 
Finally, I will need you to invest the rest funds in a profitable partnership business venture in your country, we will discuss our partnership terms when we arrange to meet after the completion of this transfer.
I hope to hear from you soon, my regards to your family.
Best Regards,
Ata Yusuf.FROM:MR AUDITOR EDWARD.

Dear Sir/Madam,
Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and if it might offend you without your prior consent and writing through this channel. 
I am AUDITOR EDWARD CHIEF AUDITOR MINISTRIE OF FINANCE ECONOMICS COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC.I got your information when I was searching for a reliable,honest and trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the many names and lists in the web site.I wish to transfer the sum of $14,300,000.00 USD (Fourteen
Million Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only.)into your personal or company`s bank account. 
This fund was a residue of the over invoiced Industrial Contract bills awarded by MINISTRIE OF
FINANCE ECONOMICS COTONOU-BENIN REPUBLIC to some foreign firms.This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed off.As the chief auditor,I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary. It was my consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne out of our beleive in the non-stable and sporous political nature of this sub-region. 
The original contractors have been duely paid by the Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest (Central Bank of the West African States)This balanceis suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice.I intend to pay out this fund now as the organisation is winding up its activities. Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working under this organisation, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your comprehensive advise,assistance and
partnership in your country. 
I have however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 40% of the entire sum as
compensation,why 55% will be held on trust for me while 5% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost if any,during the course of the transactions.
This transaction will be successfully concluded within 5-7 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.You should provide the followings. 
NAME OF YOUR BANK....................................
ADDRESS OF THE BANK..................................
ACCOUNT NUMBER.......................................
BENEFICIARY’S NAME...................................
TEL/FAX NUMBERS OF THE BANK..........................
COUNTRY OF BANK......................................
YOUR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER.............................
YOUR AGE.............................................
OCCUPATION...........................................
Upon the receipt of this informations,the certificate of job completion of one of the contracts will be issued in your for the transfering of the fund to your nominated account without delay.As with the case of all organised (sensitive)and conspired DEALS,we solicit for our unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We hope to retire peacefully
and lead a honourable business life afterwards. There are no risks involved. 
Well, this is the sharing ratio of this $14.3M for both of us:-
1) I want you to know that my 55% from this fund $14.3M is: $ 7,865,000 :00.
2) While your own 40% from this fund $14.3M is: $5,720,000:00.
3) While 5% from this fund $14.3M for any expenses Made by you and me is: $7,15,000:00.
REPLY ASAP. 
With regards.

From The Desk Of

Email:barrken_san@dbzmail.com
Attn: Sir/Madam.
I am Barrister Ken Amadi (SAN), a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to mrs. Ann Parker, a national of your country,. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On December 8, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mrs. Ann Parker. made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14.6,000,000.00(Fourteen Million, Six Hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to her forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month, I sent a reminder and finally i discovered from her contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mrs. Ann Parker. died from a ghastly automobile accident.
On further investigation, I found out that she died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace her next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mrs. Ann Parker. did not declare any next of kin or relations in all her official documents, including her Bank Deposit paperwork in her Bank. This sum of US$14.6,000,000.00 is still sitting in her Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim this fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mrs. Ann Parker. so that the fruits of this woman's labuor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your 
1.Your full names 
2.Contact address
3.Your direct telephone and Fax number
4.Your age
5.Your marital status
Based on the following informaion been provide by you i shall prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.
I will drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/ administration in your favour for the transfer. I would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of kin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mrs. Ann Parker. to travel and claim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe which is used by her bank as an offshore payment center to the bank. The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you then 10% for any expensee that may come up. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by me with my position as Attorney guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply
Thanks and regards.
Barr. Ken Amadi

I am Barrister John Solomon a legal Solicitor and I was the Personal Attorneyand legal adviser to Mr.Joshua Adams, a national of your country,who used to work with Mobil oil Company here in Togo.
On the 7th of April 2002, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along imo Express Road.
All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.
Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives,this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail,hence I contacted you.
I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before they get impounded by the security company were my client deposited this consignment(two trunkboxes).
Particularly,the security company where the deceased had deposited this consignment valued at about eight million five hundred thousand united state dollars ($U.S8.5million) has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the consignment confiscated/impounded within the next ten official working days.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over two years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this consignment valued at eight million five hundred thousand united state dollars($U.S8.5million)can be claimed by you and then you and i can share the money.
Note that this consignment was recorded as family treasures belonging to my late client and only you and i knows the content of the two boxes with the security company.
I will require your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through.I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangementthat will protect you from any breach of the law.
Contact me via my private email (barrister_johnsolomon@yahoo.co.uk) to enable us discuss further.

Dearest Beloved one,
Based on your profile, l am happy to request for your assistance and also  to go into business partnership with you, i believe that you will not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you.
I am Miss Vivian Mutan  ,21years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS MUSTAPHA MUTAN. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of LIBERIAN  during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.
But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was registered as family valuables personal for security reasons.
I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in LIBERIAN . The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
1. Can I completely trust you?
2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you?
Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
Thank you so much.

ABIDJAN COTE D IVOIRE 
Hello,
Good day to you the complement of today. i am happy to request for your assistance and also  to go into business partnership with you, i believe that you will not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you.
I am Miss Aicha Kone,22 years old and the only daughter of my late parents MR.and MRS MUSTAPHA KONE. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.
But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of Ten million  United State Dollars.(USD$10 million) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was registered as family valuables personal for security reasons. 
I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 
1. Can I completely trust you?
2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you? 
Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
Thank you so much. 
My sincere regards, 
MIss Aicha kone

http://messenger.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200471ave/direct/01/Dearest In Christ,
Dearest In Christ,
I am Mrs Elizabeth Williams,from Kuwait.I am married to late Mr Jerry Williams,
who worked with Kuwait Embassy in Ivory Coast for Twenty-Six years before
he died in the year 2001,after a brief illness that lasted for only five
days.  We were married for Eighteen years with a duaghter(Lilian)who later
died in a motor accident.
Before the untimely death of my husband,we were both born again Christians.
Since after his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my
matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive
he deposited the sum of (US$5.8 M)(Five Million,Eight hundred Thousand United
States Dollar) in a General Trust Account with a prime bank in Abidjan Cote
d'Ivoire. Presently,this money is still with the bank.
Recently,Following my ill health, my Doctor told me that I may not last for
the next eight months due to my cancer problem.The one that disturbs me most
is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I decided to donate this
fund to a Christain organization (Church) that will utilize this money the
way I am going to instruct herein,according to the desire of my late husband
before his death.
I want this fund to be used in Christain Activities like,Orphanages, Christain
schools, and Churches for propagating the word of God and to endeavor that
the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that "Blessed
is the hand that giveth". I took this decision because I don't have any child
that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians
and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't
want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is
why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where
I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus
14 VS 14 says that "the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace".
I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health
hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't want
them to know about this development.With God all things are possible.
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank
in Abidjan. I will also issue you the documents that will prove you the present
beneficiary of this fund.
I want you and the Church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants
to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful
all through your life. Contact me on this e-mail address:(elizabeth_w1007@yahoo.com).
any delay in yourreply will give me room in sourcing another Church for this
same purpose.
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping
to receive your reply.
Remain blessed in the Lord.
Yours in Christ,

Email:nelsonkamara_2@walla.com
Dear Respectful One,
Permit me to inform you our desire of going into business relationship with
you. I know you might be surprised on recieving this mail from us due to
we have not met before.
By brief introduction , I am Nelison and Linda, my younger sister. We are
native of  bouake district in republic of Cote d'Ivoire. We are the children
of late Chief and Mrs. David Kamara, who was assasinated by the rebels in
our home town during the recent political crises of 19th sept.2003. Untill
the death of our parents, they were very wealthy Cocoa/cafe farmers & exporter
based in abidjan the capital city of coted'ivoire.
Before their death in a private specialist hospital, my father called me
on his bed side and secretly confided to me the sum of US$10.5 million dollars
which he deposited in one of the banks in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire for onwardly
transfer abroad for investment on his proposed cocoa processing company
through an assistance of a foreign partner.
My father also told me his intension to invest part of the money in collaboration
with oil companies in countries like Libya, America or Europe, but unfortunately
he died the way he did without accomplishing his objective as a result of
the rebels attack.
Having know that he will not survive from the injuries he sustained as a
result of the wounds and pains inflinched on him by the rebels, then advised
me to quickly and hurriedly go into his personal underground safe in our
family villa and take the documents covering the deposit in the bank and
look for a true and trustworthy foreigner assist us as partner to front to
the bank as our late parents partner abroad for immediate transfer of the
money for investment in any lucrative business of our chioce for our future
welfare.
Upon the instruction and advice by my father before he finally died, I therefore
request your assistance to help us for onward transfer of the money to your
country for  investment partnership with you in any lucrative business in
your country.  We have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum immediately
the transfer  is made, while 2.5% also will be set aside to cover all the
expenses you  might incure on the process.
Upon your acceptance to our proposal, kindly get back to me through the above
email address so that we can discuss further process on the ways to  achieve
this golden success together.
Note, we are still in the refugee camp Yamussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire, We need
your urgent attention to this mail because we want to leave here for a
better future with you abroad, as the rebels had killed our parent and also
have taken over my home town as their operational territory, we  look forward
to you to help us with most urgency and honesty.
Expecting your reply soon.
Best Regard and God Bless you.
Nelison & sister

Hello,
READ CAREFULLY PLEASE
For this letter is strictly personal, intimate and confidential.
Forgive this unusual manner of contacting you, but this particular letter
is of exceptional and very private nature. There is absolutely going to be
a great doubt and distrust in your heart in respect of this email, coupled
with the fact that, so many miscreants have taken possession of the Internet
to facilitate their nefarious deeds, thereby making it extremely difficult
for genuine and legitimate business class persons to get attention and recognition.
There is no way for me to know whether I will be properly understood, but
it is my duty to write and reach out to you.
For I know that you are the only one that can be trusted to handle this project
effectively without making me regret.
Though this approach appears desperate, difficulties encountered in efforts
to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to assist
me in securing and investing this fund.
My name is Bona Ken, I am the operational manager in account management section
in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South
Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished
with his whole families on 18TH JULY 2003 in KENYAN PLANE CRASH with the
whole passengers aboard.
There is an account opened in this bank in 2000 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST
who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since
his death, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of
kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and
no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the account
has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company.
The total amount involved is 116,000,000.00 USD.[One Hundred and Sixteen
Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $16,000,000.00
[Sixteen Million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment
from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance
to your account.
I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank
who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of
the fund to any foreign bank account, which you are going to nominate. On
this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the
foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank
account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any
viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.
The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than three
years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury
as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy.
In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you
can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a
reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her
personal account. At the conclussion of the transfer 60% of the fund will
be for me, I will give you 25% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity
both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside
to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.
Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you detailed information about
the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business
is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear
as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking
days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the
deceased.
When you receive this letter. Kindly send me e-mail . You should also include
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.
Respectfully yours,
Bona Ken.

Dearest One, 
Greetings and I pray that this mail will meet you in good health and please let this message not be a surprise to you because I lay all the trust in you before i decided to disclose this confidential information to you due to I need your help. 
I am Brinda Turey , the only daughter of my late parents Chief.and Mrs Turey. My fathe
was a highly reputable business magnet (a cocoa, diamond and gold merchant).It was sad to say that he passed away mysteriously after a business trips abroad. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by one of my uncle ,but God knows the truth!
Sorry to say that I never know the caring of my mother because she died when I was just 4 years old which made me the best man for my late father and he never hide anything from me.
Before he made the trip to France that lead to my misfortune(his death)He called me, explained to me the reason why he will make the trip...and also told me that he has the sum of Nine million, Five hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$9.500,000)deposited in one of the security company's here in Abidjan Ivory coast West Africa, which he disguised and declared the box to contain family valuables instead of money, by this way the company does not know the true content of the box.The 
deposit document which I have in my possession carries my late father's name 
as the depositor, while I'm the next of kin on the same document.I evacuated from Sierra Leone last week because the deposit that was made by my late father secretly in Abidjan,Cote d'Ivoire and also with the fear of my greedy relations. 
I arrived in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire same last week but Ivory Coast or Cote d'Ivoire is a French speaking
country and as a result of Language barrier am more or less confused on who to  confide in over my inherited health, that's why I am confiding in you because is my wish to evacuate and relocate out entirely from Africa with my 
inherited wealth to start a new life. 
I have no documentary problems with the security company but the only problem is the nature of deposit that was made by my late father which I will explain to you once you declare your wiliness to assist me.
Really, the death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.
Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 
1. Can you honestly help me? 
2. Can I completely confide in you without any bridge of trust? 
3. Surely you will be highly compensated but
I need to know what you 
need me to offer you in returns of your assistance to me ? 
Thanks and I await your response .

Stay connected with your friends even when away from PC.  Link: http://in.mobile.yahoo.com/new/messenger/  I am Jerome Williams Lewis Esq. a solicitor.. 
From:  Jerome Williams Lewis Esq.
The inspiration to contact you is simply divine
providence,I am making this proposition because I have to seek the
partnership of a resource person to help me realise this project.
I am Jerome Williams Lewis Esq. a solicitor and investment
consultant based in london, United Kindom. I was attending a business
luncheon in Berlin,Germany and I got introduced to the renowned 
German
businessman and property mogul, Mr Andreas Schranner(of the blessed
memory).
He engaged my services as attorney and investment
consultant and my primary assignment was to spearhead his investment
forays in the United Kingdom.three months later I invited him to 
London
and under my professional guidance and based on my advice he made a
fixed deposit of 30,000,000,00EUR at with security companies in 
Germany
and Netherlands.
This deposit was for 12months and upon maturity I
made effort to contact my client, I could not reach him or any member
of his family. I was forced to travel to germany and there I got the
tragic news that on July 25TH, 2000, my client Mr Andreas Schranner,
his wife maria, their daughter eich and husband christian and their 
children perished in the Air France concorde New York bound flight;
please click here:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
I have made effort to locate any member of his family
with strong biological links to my late client without
success.
The search to find a close relation is one that has
consumed time and resources.The institution is asking me to either
present a next of kin to late Andreas Schranner or forfiet the
depsosit. My proposal is to you as next of kin to late Andreas
Schranner and process the deposit and collect the deposits for our
mutual benefit.
My capacity as solicitor/investment consultant to my
late client gives me the discretion to package and transfer the 
deposit
to you.
I will give you 30% for your effort, 60% for me and
10% for Charity and Tsunami Victims. It will amount to
injustice if i do not take this decisive step to secure this deposit,
and invest it The late Schranner was also a friend in addition to our
business relationship.
I will wait for your reaction and response and then
together we can jumpstart this project and nurture it to reality.
Please, make sure you respond through this my confidential email

Greetings, 
I am Dr. Phil Hodkinson, Group Finance 
Director (H.B.O.S) I understand that through Internet is not the best 
way to link up with you because of the confidentiality which the 
transaction demands. However, I have already sent you this same letter

have not heard from you, hence my resending it again.

a dormant account in my office, as Group finance director with Halifax

15,000,000 million pounds in an account offshore. If you can be a

Kindest Attention, I am MR.Glas philip director of operations with 
favovr Bank in London, my late customer an expatriate was killed in an 
unknown circumstances and before his death he had some unclaimed 
treasury bills (Bonds) with volks Bank in London. I decided to search 
for any of my late customer's relative which have been very difficult 
for me before those treasury bills(Bonds) get confisticated or declared 
unserviceable by the bank. In 2002 he invested in treasury bill bonds 
here in London in my bank totalling 15.3 million pound sterlings which 
was due to be collected in 2005 with acrued dividends.On my yearly 
appraisal of my customer at the turn of every year, I discovered that 
his investment is overdue for retrieval.I put up series of mail to Mr 
George Reid which were sent back uncollected.I later discovered that He 
passed on in february 2004.I tried to contact any of his relatives but 
to no avail, hence I decided to contact you to come in as his next of 
kin. I will prepare every operation that will assist your claim, The 
treasury bills(Bonds) will be released to you within 10 working days 
after you have filed in for claims.For your assistance you shall have 
30% of the entire sum.This transaction is 100% risk free and any risks 
will be on me as the director of operations so be rest assured. I would 
want you to send me your full names your phone number and your mailing 
address to enable me talk to you before I send you the certificate of 
deposit.As soon as I hear from you, I will send you the documents and 
other relevant information relating to this transaction.I believe in 
confidentiality and openess with regard to this transaction. I will 
like you to acknowledge the receipt of this e-mail as soon as possible  
and treat with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.I look forward to 
your quick reply. Sincerely, MR.Glas Philip

Dearest One,
I am Mrs williams Helen and the only wife of late Mr James williams who happens to be my husband.  
it is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad, 
12th.Feb. 2004.Though his sudden  death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.
But God knows the truth Before his death on Febuary 12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told her that he made a deposit of $35 million US DOLLARS (thirty five MILLION USA DOLLARS)  with a security company in a box  here in Abidjan Ivory Coast. 
and he did not disclose the name of the security company to his secretary  and used my name as the next of kin, He also explained that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business assocaites, 
He said that I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my  choice where I will transfer this money  and use it for investment  purposes,can you  assist me in clearing this fund into your account overseas as a beneficiary of the fund,and also use it for an investment purpose.I am just a house wife,  really don't know what to do.Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds. 
This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my husband actually brought sorrow to my life.
Dearest one I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded,so that I will know how am  I'm going to come over to your country . Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
1. Can you honestly help me as your relation or
business partner?
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of the total amount in question
will be good for you  after the money is in your account?
Beside I'm corresponding with you from my country here in Cote D'Ivoire West Africa and moreso there is great political war going on here in my  country  that is the main reason why I contacted you to help me in getting  me, my only son and our inheritance out of this country so that I may not loosed my life or my son or the inheritance to war in this country,
Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.You can also  reach me  with   williams _405@sify.com

Dearest one. 
I will like to put a proposal to you. i am not by in any way compelling you.Brief information about myself.
I am the only Daughter of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.rich. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.
It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad on the 12th September 2004. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of
his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 6yrs old, and since then my father took me so special. 
Before his death on September 2004, he called me and informed me that he has the sum of Nine Million, Seven Hundred thousand United State
Dollars.(USD$9,700,000.00)left in fixed deposit account in one of the leading banks in Africa. He further told me that he
deposited the money in my name, and also gave me all the necessary but legal documents to this fund with the bank.
I am just 20 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do. Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds and after the transaction I will come and reside permanently in your country till such a time that it will be convinient for me to return back home if I so desire. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant
political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I also want to invest the fund under your care because I am ignorant of business world.
I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:
1. Can you honestly help me from your heart?
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of

Please, consider this and get back to me as soon as possible. Immedaitely I confirm your willingness, I will also inform you more details involved in this matter.

Good day
I know this mail might come to you as surprise but kindly allow me the 
opportunity of introducing myself. I am Ms. Aminata Bobi Kabila; 
daughter of  the former head of state/president of Congo-Kinshasa 
(former 
Zaire), Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila. 
I got your particulars through the South African Chamber of Commerce; 
However, i am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on 
this 
confidential business proposal with full financial benefit for both my 
family and you.
Before i go into further details, please be informed that i am writing 
without any other perso(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this 
transaction. Therefore i will appreciate same attitude to be maintained 
all through. I have the sum of USD8.5 Million from a secret sale of 
Diamond by my father before he was assassinated by one of his body 
guards 
(Rashid) on January 16th 2001. The essence of this mail is to ask you 
to stand as my foreign partner and receive the fund on my behalf as i 
can not do much on my own due to security reasons, my narration below 
will explain better. Before i continue, be well informed that your 
share 
in this transaction has been calculated at 30% of the total sum, 5% for 
expenses that may be incurred if any and the rest for my family and me.
My father as an African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having 
married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my 
father, my step-brother Joseph, who is the current president of my 
country, 
is the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about 
this deal.
Already president Joseph is using his power to colonise all the money 
and private property which our father left behind for the whole family. 
Now my mother, myself and my younger brother are left with nothing in 
the inheritance of my late father’s wealth. Our situation is seriously 
critical that we need your assistance to help us receive this fund for 
relocation overseas and for proper investment jointly between we and 
you. Let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction 
because the diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pattern that 
shows no direct trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present 
money is in cash and is secured in a security company as family 
treasures.
I am waiting for your quick and favourable response, and in case you 
have any question(s), do not hesitate to contact me urgently.
Thanks,
Ms. Aminata B. Kabila.I AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE 
Sir/Madam,
I have made up my mind to contact you for assistance, after considering your 
outstanding performance in business. There are certain times in one�s life 
time that whether or not one indicate interest for certain assignment; the 
people would look for him/her for assistance. Pls .Do not allow this golden 
opportunity to slip off my hands, as I believe it will be of good benefit to
both of us.
My reason for writing to you is for the fact that I need your assistance to 
make a transfer of US$26.2Million to your bank account and this requires to 
be done through a trusted person, who will not seat on the fund after the 
transfer of the fund.
Before I will comment further let me introduce myself to you: I am Mr. 
Sheriff Johnson, the son of Mr. Benjamin Johnson. My father Mr. Benjamin was 
the former economic adviser on petroleum to the Head of state of Equatorial 
Guinea. He was poisoned to death by his business partner
about some months ago, and he died in a private hospital here in Malabo � 
Equatorial Guinea. When he was about to die, he (secretly) called me beside 
his sick bed and told me that he deposited the sum of (USD26.2Million United 
State Dollars) in Ghana Bank call SG-SSB BANK LTD  this he told me as he was 
about to die.
Is this US$26.2M that I want to transfer to your account for investment? I 
have decided to let you have for yourself (20%) of the total sum for using 
your bank account in securing this fund.
I will give you more information as soon as I received your reply. Please do 
not forget to include your personal telephone number for easy communication.
I look forward to hearing from you soonest,
Truly yours,
Sheriff Johnson

FROM: MOHAMMED WILLIAMS
JOHANNESBURG
REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
Email: moha_william61@hotmail.com
Dear Sir,
PRIVATE AND HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
Greeting! I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please this 
letter is a request from a family in dire need of assistance. I am Mr. 
Mohammed Williams from Angola.The first and the only son of Brigadier Chanza 
Williams communicating to you from Johannesburg, South Africa.
I got your address from my random search at the net. And, I on behalf of my 
widowed mother Mrs. Bridget Williams  decided to solicit for your assistance 
to transfer the sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million Eight Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars), which he deposited in a safe box to private 
security company in Johannesburg, South Africa.
In fact, my father said, and I quote: �My son, I wish to draw your attention 
to US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States 
Dollars). I deposited the box containing the fund in a security company in 
Johannesburg, South Africa as valuables. During the war, I was very 
committed and dedicated in winning the war against the rebels, until I found 
out that the senior army officers and government functionaries were busy 
helping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to 
foreign countries. Due to this, when the former adviser to the president and 
I were assigned by the president (JOSE EDUARDO SANTOS) to purchase arms in 
South Africa, we saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and 
share it, of which I got a total sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million 
Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).
In case of my absence on earth as a result of death, only you should solicit 
for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist you to 
transfer this money out of South Africa for investment purpose. I deposited 
the box in your name and you can claim it alone with deposited code. Your 
mother is with all the documents. Take good care of your mother and your 
sisters.
>From these words of my late father, you can understand that life and future 
of my family depend on this fund, as such I will be grateful if you can 
assist us. We are now living in South Africa as political asylum seekers. 
Financial laws and regulations of the Republic of South Africa do not permit 
us certain financial rights. In view of this, I cannot invest this fund in 
South Africa hence; I am seeking your assistance to transfer this fund out 
of South Africa for investment purpose. For your assistance, we are prepared 
to offer you 25% of the total fund while 5% will be set aside for any 
expenses incurred during this transaction.
Please note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the major thing I 
demand from you is to assure me the safety of this money when it finally 
gets to you. Further information and arrangement commence as soon as trust 
confidence and good relationship are established. I shall be most grateful 
if you maintain the confidentiality of this matter. Please, confirm your 
interest through the above contact telephone numbers or email.
Best regards,
MOHAMMED WILLIAMS.

Big Chance to Win 50,000 Yahoo! Points!CONFIDENTIAL DEAL,PLEASE GET BACK TO ME
Dear Friend, 
I am captain James .W. Brian in the US Marine Corps on Monitoring and Peace a 
keeping mission in Baghdad-Iraq. The reason why I am explaining  my finding 
to you is to seek for your assistance to enable you contributes 
immensely to the actualization of my dreams. 
On the 18th day of March 2007, we were alerted on the presence of some 
terrorists hideouts in Haifa Street, a long thoroughfare of high-rise 
buildings built by Saddam Hussein here in Baghdad. 
After Immediate intervention by the Iraqi forces and ours, we were able  to 
capture many foreign Arab fighters linked to al Qaeda in that operation and 
over 100 militants were killed on the process. Among the  Arab fighters 
linked to al Qaeda two were interrogated by two of our  intelligent 
investigators and I. They confessed that some of them are  fighters for al 
Qaeda and some are for Ayman al-Zawahiri and they took us to  some of their 
hideout which runs along the west bank of the Tigris River  that cuts through 
the capital. 
When we invaded into the hideout, we recovered several guns, amour including 
some boxes among which two contains bullets, one filled with  hard  drugs 
(heroine) and the other two to my amazement contain some US Dollars 
which we assumed amounted to $23.2M after I and two of the  intelligent 
investigators counted them and it took us over 4 hours to get  it counted. 
I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have 
the money to our selves, they all agreed to the plan and they  replied to me 
on how I can get this huge sum out of this country and I  told them that 
ital&#8482;s no problem. 
This motivated me to connive with my best friend in our force who went with 
me and the two other officers to keep the boxes in a safer place. 
I am now in keen need of a "Reliable and Trustworthy" person like you who 
would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dollars for 
me  untill my assignment elapses here. 
I assure and promise to give you 20% of this fund, however feel free to 
negotiate what you wish to have as your percentage in this deal. 
Please assure me of your keeping this topmost secret to protect my job with 
the US Monitoring and Peace-Keeping mission. please you can  contact me with 
my private mailbox......  capt.james_brianusmarine5@yahoo.com

As you know very well Iraq is gradually undergoing a rebuilding process in some parts and there is much need for reconstruction which was why I was invited. I evaluate the level of destruction and offer professional advice in line with the way they intend rebuilding and reconstructing damaged facilities. Work has been risky no doubt and challenging as sometimes we are faced hard on with armed insurgents where we lose some soldiers during confrontation. I have had my own share of losses as I lost a friend whom I have known for 12 years.
On the 27th day of March 2007, at about 11:00 hrs during a normal inspection routine along Haifa Street where there is long rough high-rise buildings which were built and occupied by the late Saddam Hussein when he was alive, I with other 3 soldiers proceeded to a marked site and as I commenced evaluation work while I was closely guided by soldiers, I discovered an unusual bulge in a cellar which I presumed to be a storage room, I decided to have a look at it, only for me to kick the metal covering and find a metal boxes (5 in number) piled on top one another which were locked with a padlock each with a sign written in each of them. 
Upon forcing the boxes open, we discovered several guns, amour and some boxes amongst which two contained guns and bullets, one filled with hard drugs (heroine) and the other two to my amazement contained some US Dollars and kilograms of alluvial Gold, which we counted and discovered that the money in one of the boxes amounted to $9.2 Million. I believe the boxes owned and linked to the Al Qaeda and Ayman al-Zawahiri.
I however instructed them to keep this in high secrecy so that we can have the money and alluvial Gold to our selves, they all agreed to the plan of getting the money out of the country, but first we had to hide the money and alluvial Gold in some safe and untraceable location. We secretly kept the boxes in a safer place after which we handed over the drugs and the weapons to our superiors. 
I am now in desperate need of a “Reliable and Trustworthy” person like you who would receive, secure and protect these boxes containing the US Dollars and alluvial Gold for me until my assignment elapses here. We cannot afford to leave the boxes here in Iraq for any reason since Iraq is getting unsafe and dangerous everyday. We have no idea what could happen next as everything remains inconclusive at this point. I am fully aware of what your thoughts would be next, but on receiver of your response, I will send my picture as well as my Identity, for you to know whom you are dealing with.
I assure and promise to give you 15% of this fund and some quantity of the alluvial Gold, please assure me of your keeping this topmost secret within you so that my job would not be jeopardized.
My Sincere Regards,
Jonathan Charles.

Dr John Ejime 
Office of the Financial Controller 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
Falamo Ikoyi Lagos-Nigeria. 
Tel/ Fax: 234 1 7592865. 
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION. 
Dear Sir,
I am Dr.John Ejime,the financial controller of the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation Headquarters Lagos. I am writing you on behalf of my colleagues
in the corporation and have been assign to seek for the assistance of a
reliable foreign company through which we can transfer the sum of Thirty
Five Million United States Dollars Only (US$35,000,000). This fund is deposited
in the Corporation Treasury account with the Apex Bank. 
ORIGIN OF THE FUND: 
This sum arose from the deliberated over-invoicing of a contract awarded
by my ministry Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to foreign firm in
the twinlight days of the last military regime. This contract has been completely
executed and commissioned and the contractor that handled this contract
has collected his full and final payment thus leaving behind the above stated
amount which represent the over invoiced sum. We have been safeguarding
this money for conducive time for it's transfer out of the country for our
personal use. However, the code of employment does not allow us (civil servant)
to own and operate foreign account and because the contract was handled
by a foreign firm and the payment made in dollars, we now need a foreign
partner that will present himself as the sub-contractor so that the fund
will be transfer into your company's or personal account. Your address was
made available to us by a very good friend who work with the Nigeria export
promotion council and he assured us of your company's viability and capability
in business transaction. This assurance gave us the courage to link you
up in this particular transaction and I hope it will be of mutual benefit
to all of us. Note that the nature of your business is not particularly
relevant to the success of the transaction. All we require is your willingness
to present yourself as the subcontractor by providing your bank information
so that the fund will be transferred into your account. 
SHARING RATIO:
For your assistance in this business , your share will be 30% of the total
fund. I and my colleagues will take 60% while we set aside 10% for any expenses
that may incurred in the course of this transaction. If you are willing
to assist us in this business. Send the following information. 
1. Name of your bank and address 
2. Your account number/beneficiaryâs name. 
3. Your private telephone and fax number for easy communication. 
This information will enable us put an application for payment approval
to the concerned Ministries and final to the Senate Committee on Contract
Payment and it is going to last for fourteen working days starting from
the day we receive the above information. All modalities for the take off
of this transaction have been worked out and further action will commence
immediately we hear from you. I am waiting for your reply by fax on this
fax number :234-1-7592865 as stated above. 
Yours faithfully. 
Dr.John Ejime. PRIVATE EMAIL MESSAGE
Good Day,
With warm heart I offer my friendship, and send my best wishes in this special season.
However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. 
My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek!
political asylum.
I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. 
President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.
I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.
Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 
For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 
I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.
I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 
Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

Re Urgent Assistance
Kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself. I am GEORGE KABILA,the son of the former head of state/ president of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zaire) Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila.
I am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on this confidential Business proposal with full financial benefit for both of us.
Before I go into further details please be informed that I am writing without any other person(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this  transaction. Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.
I have the sum of USD55Million from a secret sale of Diamond by my father before he was assassinated by one of his body guard (Rashid) on  January 16th 2001, which I will like you to receive on my behalf due to security  reasons,as my narration below will explain. But before I continue be well informed that your share in this transaction has been calculated at  15% of the total sum of USD$55M, 5% for expenses and the rest for my family and me.
My father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my  father, My step brother Joseph, who is the current president of my country, is  the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.
Already president Joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and private property, which my father left behind for the whole family.  Now my mother and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late  father's wealth. Our situation is seriously critical that we need your  assistance to help us receive these funds overseas for proper investment.
Let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction because the diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pattern that shows no  direct trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the money is in cash and is secured in a financial institution company as consignment.
The consignment will be released within seven (7) days of my being in receipt of your reply via my email address above only for security reasons.
I am waiting for your swift and favorable response, and in case you have any question(s), do not hesitate to contact me.
my aternative email address is (ppkabil@37.com)
my private phone number is :+229-988-039

Good Day,
With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. 
My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!
nd) to seek for political asylum.
I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. 
President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.
I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.
Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 
For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 
I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.
I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 
Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

Sincerely,
O.C.Savimbi.AWAITING YOUR RESPONES
With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising  to you to
receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction,
which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.  My name
is  Owen Mubane, the first son of Mapele Mubane, of the  most popular
black farmer  from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land  dispute in my
country. As led by my instict, I decided to contact you  through email,
after searching  for contacts via the internet, as it  is the only means
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties  with Zimbabwe for
security and safety reasons.  However, I apologize  if this is not
acceptable to you.
The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in  a
business venture. Due to the land and political problems in  Zimbabwe,
as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of  new Land Act
Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the  few rich black
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life,  my father for saw
the danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was  murdered, he withdrew
all of our business foreign accounts in dollars  and sold up our shares
in major companies. We then went to  SOUTH AFRICA  to deposit the sum of
US$14.5 million  (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand US dollars),
in a private  security company. This money was deposited with this
Private Security  company for safety and security reasons, and  was to
be used for the  purchase of land, new machines and chemicals
establishment of new  farms in Europe.
President Mugabe's support for the violent  Zimbabwean war veterans  and
some lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved  father
and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to  abandon my
inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I  resited for a
while, but when the danger became unbearable, and I  survived two murder
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe.  I am currently staying in the Netherlands
where I am seeking  political asylum. In fact my decision to come here
to seek asylum, is  because the security company from South Africa, has
a branch here,  and they have moved the deposit from their office in
Johannesburg down  here. I need to transfer this money to  an account
and invest part of  the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a
refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial
transaction, this is why  I am seeking a genuine and reliable  partner,
whose account this money can be transferred, hence this  proposal to
you.You have to understand that this decision taken by me  entrusts my
future and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping  of this
money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for  me, is to
assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the  security company
from their office here in The Netherlands, as it has  now been
transfered from Johannesburg, South Afri!  ca to their branch here. The
company will be legally informed of you  representing me.
For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can
choose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping me
open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go  into
partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the  money
in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to  notify me in
your reply.  I have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all
kinds of  expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction,
and 4% ($580,000,00) for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 10%
for assisting with opening an account, then 85%will be left in the
account here for me.
Please, I want you maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose  of
this transaction.  I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I
thank you in  advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me
on my  direct line which is 31 617 562  914 or via email
owenmubane1000@rediffmail.com.
Sincerely,
Owen Mubane.

From:Muhammed Abacha
I wish to introduce myself to you and the reason for my reaching out to you. I am Muhammed Abacha the the son of the late military head of state General Sani Abacha who died mysteriously on the 8th of June 1998. Following the death of my father Gen. Sani Abacha,elections were successfully held in the country and a civilian administration was sworn into power with the assistance of the American Government under the leadership of President Clinton. With the advent of the new democratic administration, a decision was taken by the new president
of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo to probe and ultimately prosecute all past military officers and their cohorts that served in very strategic capacities in the last military regime of my father.I was among those singled out to to be punished after a makeshift trial,for the supposed deeds of my dad,ever since I have been in detention(the past 3 years).
On monday the 24 September 2002,I was released,on the condition that I will release the rest of my fathers money in my care,to the tune of $I.5b,which I agreed. Now I have been released but kept under severe house arrest,I had amassed monies running into hundreds of millions of dollars stashed in various private foreign accounts around the world,most of wish have been frozen. Presently, I am confined under house arrest after my recent release from detention and I am now constrained into seeking for this assistance today because I cannot afford to let this goverment know that I still have funds stashed away. Shortly, before my detention I hurriedly deposited the sum of USD35.5 m illion with a security deposit firm for safekeeping,hence my seeking your assistance to receive this fund. I have since had
this amount stashed away in a private security company in Europe. I cannot send this money to any of my Bank Account abroad or open a new account for reasons mentioned earlier.
I hereby seek your assistance in moving and securing this money in your account abroad. I will adequately compensate you with 15% of the total sum for your assistance and co-operation with me to move this fund to your account for safe keeping where I can easily utilise it. The present administration has beamed their search light on any body remotely related to me and my family and you strongly know for certain that I am under surveillance and I cannot operate any of my bank accounts any more, due to their being frozen. I intend to safeguard and invest this amount of money abroad, but with a reliable foreign business partner so that we can invest the funds in doing business in your country. 
That is why I am soliciting your assistance and cooperation as regards this business.Arrangements are being concluded with the Security Company which has branches in Europe to receive the money in cash. I cannot tell the full story of my predicament on this letter. However you can get more information by checking the following web;

This mail sent through http://mail3000.com/register.htmlTHIS IS HUMANITERIAN SERVICE THAT REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION!
Hello my beloved kind hearted,
THIS IS HUMANITERIAN SERVICE THAT REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION!
I simply want to take this occasion to tell you about my intention to contribute toward the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and I need your help as my representative overseas. I need you to receive my financial entitlements from my financiers overseas on my behalf for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and hope you would not let me down.
It might interest you to know that in my supporting role to the Minister of Public Works here in Pretoria, South Africa it is my responsibility to handle some very intrinsic matters for, on behalf or with the Minister. By my duties, it is almost impossible for any file/Contract Proposals to get to the Minister for approval, without it passing through my scrutiny.
By my religious status and as the South African Deputy Minister of Public Works, I have cause to help a lot of foreign contractor-companies (mainly American) to secure the release of their entitlements from the coffers of the government of South Africa. I did this, principally, as a help to the concerned companies, but in appreciation of my efforts, most of them committed themselves to paying some handsome monetary honorarium to me. However, because of my position as a political appointee, it is impossible for me to collect such money immediately or even directly. Hence, I need you to collect this money on my behalf and use it as you would be further directed for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS. Of course your effort will not be in vain. You would be well rewarded for your help in this regards.
All the money from the various companies put together is totaling amount to Eight Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand United States Dollars (US$855,000) only. The snag is that I just discovered that I couldn't collect this money, directly, from these companies in my name or the name of any of my family members, because government will investigate "why?" and "what for? Therefore, to forestall any such problems, I decided to contact you through this secured and private medium, to solicit your assistance in this regard.
You will receive this money on my behalf, and use it as you would be further directed. That way, there will be no link between the companies and me. I will instruct the concerned companies to make the money available to you on installment either via swift means or by cheque as you so desire of not more than $75,000, as the case may be.
>From the money you receive on my behalf, you would be entitled to retaining 10% of the sum while you would be required to wire the balance 90% for its purpose of humanitarian services as would be advised. For example, if you receive $75,000, you would be required to retain 10% ($7,500) while you wire the balance $67,500 for its purpose. This is basically on trust. It is a simple job you do for me and all expenses for the cost of transfer of funds would be from the 90% and you will not spend a single cent from your money to actualize this project. No financial commitment from you and it's simple and risk free. You receive the money on my behalf, take away your 10% and redirect the remaining 90% as would be instructed. I can assure you that if you keep to our agreement, this will be the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship between the two of us. Afterward, there are a lot of other things we can do together that will fetch you a fortune.
If you are interested and would like to work with me for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS, I would need you to provide me with the following:
(1) IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY SWIFT MEANS:
Provide me with:
a). Name of your bank.
b) Address of your bank.
c) Bank Telephone and Fax.
d) Account Number.
e) Swift Code/Routing Number.
d)Account Names.
(2).OTHERWISE, IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY CHECK:
Then, you do not have to provide your banking information. Simply provide me with:
a) Your full names (As would be on the check).
b) Contact/Mailing address
c) Your Telephone and Fax Number.
Furthermore, as surety for the money that would be paid to you on my behalf, I would need a scanned copy of your International Passport or Drivers License for record purpose.
When I receive all the aforementioned, I will then send a working AGREEMENT between you and I, to guide and guard this relationship.
Once all these are sorted out, I will notify the first company of my desire to receive my money through you and instruct them accordingly.
In conclusion:
I wish to draw your attention to the wise observation of Marlene Gill, who wrote:
"To exist is to change,
To change is to mature,
To mature is to go on creating one's self endlessly,"
As we continue to change and to mature as individuals and as a nation, let us continue to dream that one-day, very soon, Cholera and HIV/AIDS will no longer devastate our nation, that all of our young people will resort to responsible behavior and that the moral values of our forebears will once more dominate our society.
LET US DARE TO DREAM. For it is not an impossible dream.
This is simply from my heart to you.
I wish you the very best while giving my thanks in anticipation of a lasting business relationship with you.
Kindly send the requirements as mentioned above via my private email addresses as stated.
My regards,
K. M. ZONDI (REV),

Re: Transfer Of Usd $21,500.000{Twenty - One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Us Dollars Only.
I am a member of the Federal Government Of  Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (N.N.P.C).
Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Petroleum Trust Fund (P.T.F.) BY MY COMMITTEE.
This contract was over invoiced to the tune of us$ 21.5Million Dollars. This was done delibrately. The over - invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project.
We not want to transfer this money, which is in a suspense account with the P.T.F. into any oversea account, which we expect you to provide for us.
Share:
60 % of the money would be for my partners and I.
30 % of the money would be yours, for providing us with logistics, which, would include a safe bank account, where we shall facilitate funds transfer into, as soon as documentations are concluded over here.
10 % of the money has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the course of the transaction, (both local and international expenses).
If interested in assisting us, please contact me via  my secured satellite tel number- 881-631-410-574, specially procured for this project, using the text message..
It may interest you to know that a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice Miller, President of Crane International Trading Corp., of 153 East 57th St., 28th floor, N.Y.10022, Telephone: 212-308-7788 and Telex: 6731689. The deal was concluded and all covering documents, forwarded to Mr. Miller to authenticate the claims. Once the funds were transferred, Mr. Miller presented to his bank, all the legal documents and remitted the whole funds to another bank account, and disappeared completely. My colleagues and I were shattered, since such opportunities are not easy to come by.
Please, if you are interested in assisting us carry out to the fullest capacity, this transaction, we would require the following information from you which would enable us make formal application to the various ministries / parastatals, for the release and onward transfer of the money to your account.

3.Your Bank Account Number and Beneficiary Name - You must be the signatory.
Please, note that we have strong and reliable connections at the Central Bank Of Nigeria and other Government Parastatals, hence assistance in this regards, would not be a problem.
At the conclusion of this transaction, we shall use same contacts to withdraw all documents used in the course of this, to avoid any trace whatsoever that may ever arise, to you or to us, now and in the nearest possible future.
It might also interest you to know that we are mere civil servants who do not want to miss this opportunity, hence, we want this money transferred out, as soon as possible, before the newly democratically elected government ever think of making enquiries as regards the various activities of the past military government.
Kindly contact me as soon as possible, whether or not you are interested in this deal, so that whereby you are not interested, it would give us more room to scout for another partner. But if you are interested, kindly contact me via above email, telephone or fax, so that we can swing into action, as time is not on our part.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

THE WIFE OF LATE CHIEF FREDRICK MCKNIGHT,
FORMER POPULAR BLACK FARMER IN ZIMBABWE.
Dear Friend.
With due respect, trust and humility I write this
Letter to you seeking your help and assistance though
It�s difficult since we have not met before. 
I got your good contact from the Zimbabwean
Information Exchange(ZIE) regarding your business
profile and Sincerity, I believe that you are capable
and reliable in assisting this my urgent request. I am
Mrs. BUSISIWE LUCY MCKNIGHT, the wife of LATE FREDRICK
MCKNIGHT, the former popular black farmer in Zimbabwe
who is also a Famous politician, in the Zimbabwe
political arena. My husband was assonated by president
Mugabe and his men because he (my husband)refusal to
agree with the so called president to take the lands/farms 
of the whites who contribute to make the country what it is today.
Because of my husbands sincerity he was constantly briefing the press 
on what is going wrong in the country and the autocratic government of
Mugabe.He was assassinated on 23 November 2001 being Sunday by 8.45 in Harare, 
in Western  province of Zimbabwe, the planners of the assassination are well
know by the masses. 
My dear when this incident occurred at about 8.45 in Zimbabwe time, my husband 
did not die on the spotrather he was rushed to Harare hospital where he later died. 
Before the death of my husband, he had taken me and our son to South Africa to 
deposit the sum of US$32.5 million {Thirty two million five hundred thousand dollars} in a
security company . And now I am in Zimbabwe but my son is in South Africa 
with the money deposited in asecurity company with the documents intact. Because of
the country existing law, which bears asylum seekers/refugee like him 
(my son) and also hisage not to operate an account that exceed US$2000.00
and the fear of the South African government not raising  eyebrows about the
money therein South Africa, I decided to write to you seek for your help 
for this money tobe transferred into your private bank account as all
arrangements for a hitch free transfer have been fully taken care off.
And also due to my presentcondition here in Zimbabwe, Mugabe and his allied have
deride me the right of traveling outside the country, I am having a deadly 
cancer ofthe breast which make me to be worried to see that
this money is in a safe hand before anything happened to me, it is the 
only thing left for the upbringing of my children whom are still young before my
husband left me. I want to assure you also that this 
transaction is 100% risk free as no other person knows this 
apart from my first Son Samuel and I. Dear, as for your rewarding kind 
assistance I have resolved to give you 20% of the total amount, while 5% have 
been mapped out for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this
transaction. We planned to invest the rest of the money in your country under 
your guidance.If you are willing to assist us try as much as possible to write 
me so I also inform my son about my negotiations with you.
Dear, bear in mind that our lives and future of my
children depend on this fund and we do hope that this
money will be safe, when finally transferred into your account. I do hope of 
establishing a rewarding and good relationship with you and your
family after this transaction. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible. 
Please I would likeyou to keep this transaction highly confidential and secret 
considering my son�s position in South Africa. I have already brief my son 
immediately you,if  you  receive this mail kindly contact him.

For super low premiums ,click here http://www.dialdirect.co.za/quoteTHANK YOU
I know you will find this surprising,please pardon my surprise. With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings,and I hope this mail meets you in good time.I have mused over your profile for sometime and decided to contact you in this regard. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past,I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Mr.Robert Savimbi,I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email.
My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death,Mr. Antonio Dembo and general Paulo Lukamba who were his second in commands, assumed office as leaders of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo and general lukamba,
there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose them and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension
and confusion in UNITA became uncontrollable when Mr.Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now
desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek political asylum.
I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (Eighteen Million Dollars Only), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank
account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam,Netherlands. in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited
for sometime now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to the netherlands to sought for political asylum here is because of the safe deposit.
President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.
I plan to use this money to safeguard my families future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.
Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name from the Security and finance company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here.
For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with Fifteen Percent of the Money of the money.
I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.
I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal.
Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

CONFIDENTIAL/URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
Dear Friend,
I am delighted to write this letter to you hoping that you will understand
my predicament and answer back without hesitation.
I am Dr Maryam Abacha the wife of the late Nigerian head of State General
Sani Abacha. I got your contact on the internet as I was making contact
for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children, hence
our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband.
I am in possession of $25 000.000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS ONLY)
which I want to invest in your country. For your clarification and understanding,this
money in a box which my husband deposited in the finance and security company
in dis-guise as a family treasure since 11th of febuary 1998, is not an
ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my organisation FAMILY SUPPORT
PROGRAM (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate
a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf.
On your acceptance to render this assistance to me,I will instruct the finance
company to effect a change of ownership of this fund in your name as the
bona-fide owner to enable you claim the fund from the security and finance
company,also I will disclose to you the country and the name of the finance
and security company where this money is being deposited.
What I demand from you now is to arrange for a visit to the finance company
where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.It
is very ideal you forward to me your private telephone and fax numbers to
enable me send all relevant documents pertaining the deposit of this fund
for your clarification and more understanding.
Bear in mind that this transaction demands absolute confidentiality because
properties and bank accounts both local and international bearing the Abacha's
family name, are being ordered to be confiscated by the newly elected civilian
President of Nigeria (President Olusegun Obasanjo) hence I will not want
to be exposed.
Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March
2001. You can check it through their website:www.thisdayonline.com , click
on archives,8th.june,2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen
and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad.
Thus l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail
about this transaction For your knowledge, 25% of this fund $25 000.000
(TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS) will be given to you if you assist me
to secure this fund and another 5% has been set aside for all the expenses
you might incure during the process of securing this fund.Example: TELEPHONE
BILLS, HOTEL BILLS, FLIGHT BILLS and other mislenous expenses.
When you must have taken the agreed percentage, you will use part of the
balance to buy a living house for my family there in your country, where
we shall live in the future and the remaining part will be kept for investment
package also in your country which will be under your supervision.
Contact me through my son (OMAR ABACHA) who recently escaped from Nigeria
to Johannesboug South Africa where he is now staying as a refuge on his
email address omarabacha@hotmail.com to avoid us losing this money, since
it is the only remaining fund for the survival of my family.
Thanks for your anticipated co-operation.
Yours sincerely,
MRS.MARYAM ABACHA

Dear Sir/Madam,
Good a thing to write you, we have a proposal for you. This however is not mandatory nor are we in any manner compelling you to honor it against your wish.
I am Miss Frani Korona, 18 years, and my brother Abdul Korona Junior 20 years old the daughter and son of the late Dr Abdul Korona of blessed memory. My father   was a highly reputable business man He was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation of Sierra-Leone. 
It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in Dublin during one of his business trips, though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his whom he traveled with at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old and my brother 6 years old, and since then our father took good /special care of us.
Before his death he gave to us the documents of the money he has deposited with a security company oversea in two trunk Boxes as family valuables and treasures with name of my brother as the only son  (Paul John Junior) as the beneficiary. He instructed I and my brother to move out of Sierra-Leone because of his uncle and with the political crisis in Sierra-Leone.  
The amount is US $30 million 700 hundred thousand Dollars (Thirty million seven hundred thousand United State Dollars) we managed to escape to Abidjan, the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire through the help of my father's friend. For your information, the security Company does not know the real content of the boxes and we do not wish to let  them to know until the consignments are released to you, for security reasons because they were deposited and registered as family valuables and treasures. 
We will like to leave Cote d'Ivoire entirely after this money has been transferred to you for investment purpose in your country because of the political crisis here in this country and mostly for the future of my brother and me.
My brother is presently very sick that is why I am mailing you, because he can not go to net.
Now permit me to ask these few questions: - 
1. Can you honestly help us as your own daughter and son?  
2. Can we completely trust you? 
3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you after the money is in your account?
Please, consider this and get back to us as soon as possible and May God be with you. (AMEN)
Thank you so much.
Our sincere regards,

Branch Accounts Manager,
Prudent Bank Nigeria Limited,
Falomo Office Complex,
Ikoyo, Lagos.
Nigeria.
DEAR FRIEND,
On SUNDAY, February 2, 2003, a bomb blast explosion took place on the Lagos
Island, right inside My bank; So far a total lost of about US$20.5 million
has been recorded, this includes both cash and property of the bank. Please
View the Link below:
http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/02/03/lagos.explosion/index.html
However as the Accounts Manager of the BANK,I discovered Most of our Data
on accounts has been lost as well, as there has not been anyback up or network
trace even from the HEADQUARTERS;therefore all losses would be artributed
to the! Explosion. The lagos State Government has taken charges to pay for
all losses.
I found out i still have Data's of foreign Customers who are contractors
in Nigeria and who own accounts with the Branch, Particularly that of an
American oil contractor Hsu Ben, who was reported Dead in a plane crash[Korean
Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers  aboard on August  6,1997.And
for your  perusal you can view this website:
http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list/
who's contract payments has been Made and would be tranfered to his foreign
accounts from the CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA, upon our confirmation of his
foreign designated account as well as a beneficiary to his funds and payments.
Mr Hsu Ben, while our customer never left a trace of his next of kin, and
His contract Payment which is about US$15M, would be made to no one as we(
the bank) has! none of his Data/next of kin's contact.
My proposal is that I will like you as a foriegner to stand in as the next
of kin to Mr Hsu Ben,  so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not
get into the hands of some corrupt government officials, Besides the Bank
which i work in has been blown up, i have no Job for now, i have to make
a living and only me knows the information so far about this.
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and
address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits
which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service
of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the
necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour
for the transfer.
A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of
kin. The money will be paid into your account as payment for his Contract
by t! he CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA upon my submission of the Contract information
and your application as his next of kin for us to share in the ratio of
70% for me, 20% for you and 10% will be use to cover all the expensives
that will come-up in the course of this transaction.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Accounts Manager guarantees
the successful execution of this transaction.
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe
utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be
most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to
invest my share in your country.

Dear Sir, 
ACT ACCORDINGLY AND PRIVATELY 
I am Evans Timothy the bills and exchange director at African Express 
Bank Plc.
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything has 
been taken care of and all will be well at the end of the day. I 
decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.
MY PROPOSITION;
I am writing this letter to solicit for support and assistance from you 
to carry out this business opportunity in my department.Lying in an 
inactive account awaiting liquidation is the sum of USD $10.7million 
belonging to a foreign customer(Herve Garboudes) who was an 
petroleum/gas consultant/contactor with the Nigeria National Petroleum 
coporation who happens to be deceased during a business trip. He died 
with his wife
(Christine Garboudes) on board the Swissair Flight 111 , which crashed 
into the Atlantic off Nova Scotia in september 2nd 1998. 
The news of this crash was on the news which we have notified his 
relatives to no avail.
See links below for more detail informaion: 
http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/ 
http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/08/swissair.02/
http://cnnstudentnews.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/05/swissair.transcript
Ever since he died the bank has been expecting his next of kin to come 
and claim these fund, the NDIC could not liquidate the account because 
I have filled a motion that a next of kin wrote in to the effect. To 
this effect, they can not release the money unless someone applies for 
it as next of kin, as indicated in our banking guideline. 
At this juncture i have decided to do business with you in 
collaboration with some officials in the bank, to this effect we 
solicit your assistance in applying as the next of kin and beneficiary 
to Herve Garboudes then the money will be released to you. As we do not 
want this money to go into the bank treasury as an unclaimed bill,or 
our superiors taking the funds for their own personal use.
The banking law and guideline stipulates that if such money(s) remains 
unclaimed for a period of up to seven years(7yrs) the money will be 
transferred into the banks treasury as an unclaimed bill. Our request 
for a foreigner as next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the 
customer was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as next of kin. To 
effect the immediate transfer of the fund to you as agreed, you must 
apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the decease, The fund 
shall then be transferred to you legally in accordance to all laid down 
procedures governing closure of account and transfer of funds. 
If you are willing to assist us, we have agree to give you 20 Percent 
of USD $10.7 million  
Note that this transaction is legal,safe and 100% risk free.
Upon receipt of your reply which should includes the following:
1) Your Full Name 
2) Your telephone number for easy communication between us.
I will confidentially work out all modalities for the successful 
transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary, and send to you by 
fax or email attachement the text of the application, as soon as you 
receive the text I will further clarify you in details on how to effect 
the business. 
Await to hear from you

Dear Friend, 
My warmest greetings to you. Firstly let me introduce
myself. I am Agnessa Vlachko, personal secretary to
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man. Mr.
Khodorkovsky is Chairman & C.E.O Yukos Oil (One of
Russian's Largest Oil Company) and Menatep SBP Bank (A
well reputable Financial Institution). He was arrested
in October 2003 when masked and armed members of the
security police force stormed his private jet at an
airport in Siberia. Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested for
his involvement in politics by financing the leading
and opposing political parties (The Union of Right
Forces, led by Boris Nemstov and Yabloko, a
liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor
Yavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir
Putin. 
In 2003, Sibneft (Another of Russian's Largest Oil
Company) and Yukos agreed to merge. Mr. Roman
Abramovich who controls Sibneft received US$3bn in
cash and a 26 per cent stake in the merged company in
return for his 92 per cent in Sibneft. Mr. Mikhail
Khodorkovsky my boss received the sum of US$106million
in cash. The stated sum was kept in a Financial
Institution here in Europe by me under instructions
from my boss. I was to make payment to an American oil
merchant on behalf of Mr. Khodorkovsky for his last
oil deal before his arrest.
There has been a bulk freezing of Russian Bank
Accounts linked to the Yukos Company that is why
foreign aid is required. Presently, the Russian court
has frozen the assets of Yukos due to an unpaid tax
claim during 2000 and the company may be forced into
bankruptcy. This is all an attempt by the Russian
government to bring about the total destruction of
Yukos and erode the personal wealth of Mr.
Khodorkovsky. Fear of arrest has forced all the firm's
top executives to remain outside Russia. I have
presently relocated to London. My boss has therefore
instructed me in confidence to look for a reputable
and capable individual who can assist us receive the
US$106million for safekeeping and subsequent
investment. All matters will be handled discreetly for
safety of the funds. 
As personal secretary to Mr. Khodorkovsky, I have all
the necessary documentations to lay claim to this fund
on your behalf. You will be compensated with 10% of
the total sum for your partnership. You will be
required to stand as the beneficiary of the quoted
sum, while I arrange all relevant documents, which
will enable the European Bank release the sum to you.
Once I am convinced of your preparedness to assist in
concluding this transaction I shall provide you with
more details. Please reach me immediately through the
email address  a_vlachkoc11@excite.com sending to me your
confidential telephone and fax number(s) so that I can
reach you as soon as possible.
Thank you as I look forward to your earliest response.
Yours sincerely,
Agnessa Vlachko.

Dear Friend,               
I am contacting you to front as a co-owner of my late
husband's company and beneficiary of funds
(US$25,000,000.00)due the company.
I am currently a high ranking government official in
the ruling cabinet of President Thabo Mbeki (South
Africa). I am a widow and mother of two children.My
late husband Mr Ronald Tshabalala died 1996.
After his death, I recently discovered that an
over-invoiced proceeds of a contract I helped his
company secured is yet to be paid out by the Reserve
Bank of South Africa. 
This funds emanated as a result of an over-invoiced
contract which my husband's company executed with the
Government of South Africa.I am afraid that the
government of South Africa might start to investigate
on contracts awarded from 1995 to date. If they
discover this money yet unclaimed with my husband's
name linked to it, the government will confiscate the
money and seize his assets here in South Africa and
this will definately affect my political career in
Government.
I want your assistance to front as a co-owner of his
company (Tshabalala Construction, LTD) to facilitate
the release of the funds. I will introduce a very good
attorney to assist us with the transfer process
without any hitch but he will not be told my interest
in the transaction as I play a very sensitive role in
my government. 
As the contract was executed in my present government
department, be rest assured that I will use my
position to approve the immediate release of the
entitlement. As soon as the funds is released to your
name, you are expected to move it immediately into
your personal bank account in your country. As soon as
you have confirmed receipt of the funds into your
account, I will arrange to meet with you.
If you agree to my proposal, please endeavour to send
me an urgent reply. Due to my sensitive position in
the South African Government, I would not want you to
phone or fax me. All correspondence must be through my
private mail address 
The lawyer I will recommend to assist us will be
representing our interest at the Reserve Bank of South
Africa and all necessary quarters. All future
correspondence must be made either to the attorney or
myself. 
I am reposing huge trust on you regardless of your
being a total stranger. Upon your reply, we shall
dicuss your percentage for your assistance.
Because of my sensitive position as serving government
official, I will only give you more details of myself
when we proceed further and am sure of your
personality.
Honesty and transparency, they are my best work tools.
Thank you.
Mrs Stella Sigcau.

hospital and told him that he has the sum of Nine million,seven hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$9.700,000) left in fixed deposit account in one of the leading banks.
In his farms here he still has worth of (USD$700,000) Seven hundred thousand United State  dollars cocoa which will be ready for exportation in 6 weeks time.
He further told him that he had changed the name used  in depositing the money in my name,and finally
issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of all the necessary and legal documents to this fund and the bank.
I am just 20 years old, and really don't know what to do.Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this fund and to continue my education because of the risk of insecurity to my live.My uncle

I am Mr.Mr.Gailu Fall , Bank Manager Pacific Trust Bank, Fan Road Branch,Dakar Senegal. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.Mr Guy Gelinas a Canadian businessman and longtime business associate of erstwhile Hong Kong business tycoon James Ting , made a Fixed Deposit for eigtheen calendar month, valued at US$38,500,000.00 (Thirty Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent routine notification to his forwarding address but get no reply. After a month, we send a reminder and finally we discover from his contract employer, (Abitibi - Consolidated Paper) that Mr.Guy Gelinas died in plane crash along with many others in EgyptAir Flight 990,1999 air crash (for more information about said funds and this crash you can go to the links:
Since i got this information about his death and on further investigation, I find out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempt to traced his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore make further investigation and discovered that Mr.Guy Gelinas did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank, and Mr. James Ting is no longer factor in this transaction. This sum of US$38,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.According to Laws of Senegalise at the expiration of 7 (seven)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalise Government if nobody
applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Guy Gelinas so that the fruits of this man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me and 35% for you after the expense . There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address above. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

authenticate that the Consignment belongs to you as the next of kin to Mr

Dear Friend,
I hope this meets you in good health. My name is BarristerPhilip Wilson Esq,legal practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000. You may follow the Link below to read about the Plane Crash my client lost his life:
http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml, 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/europe/672849.stm
My late client was an influential wealthy businessman, a Contractor in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the Principal owner of Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of Twenty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($25,500,000.00USD) in his domiciliary bank account in a commercial bank here in Ivory Coast. Which is one of the main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin. 
After the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The board of directors of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given to me.
It was while i was searching for his family records on the internet
that i came across your contact.I have searched through almost all the genealogy site that you can think of both in the 
Russia,USA and all the possible places I thought my clients would have possibly had a family member. Despairing and at the point of desperation, I came across your name, while trying to locate documentation's regarding possible relatives of my client in his country of origin. Convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me because of the status quo. By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my country.
I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account,
hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The rest is between you and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into your account, once this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for Taxes as your Government may require, I shall assemble all the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. 
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me.
Best Regards,
Barrister  Philip Wilson

>From Qin Wang
Lloyds TSB Pacific Limited 
Hong Kong Branch
Thank you for giving me your time. Please be patient and read my email   to you.
I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group attached in Private Banking Services. I am contacting you 
concerning a customer and, an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago, I 
contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication 
and I Would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.
In 2000, the subject matter; ref: bb/tsb/bank/73 came to our bank to engage in business 
discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a 
financial portfolio of 8.35 million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn 
over on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in 
line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services 
Department, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on 
numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various 
growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start by 
assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternative investments. Based 
on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for 
our first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 
million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he 
desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the money be 
liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. 
He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe. I informed 
him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not 
to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to 
cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around 
when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across 
borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11. 
I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in main land Europe. I 
undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter 
and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private 
firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that 
handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This 
small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and Well-
connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposited. He told me he 
wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was 
the last communication we had, this transpired around 20th  June 2002. In June last year, we 
got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio. 
This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the 
private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not 
understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.
I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating him to the 
internal investigations department of our bank. Four days later, information started to 
trickle in, that he was apparently dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead 
of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the body 
and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible 
surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his 
estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services 
usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In 
his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an 
account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name 
depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the 
choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring 
that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. 
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave 
wills in our care, in this case; he died in testate.
What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand 
something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the 
banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge 
rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have 
begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is US$ 
8,370,000.00 deposited, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to 
no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as 
far as the finance firm, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the 
funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer 
services and due process. The finance firm has no single idea of what's the history or nature 
of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that 
comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to 
track this man's family; they have investigated for months and have found no family. The 
investigation has come to an end.
My proposal ,  you share similar details to the late fellow  I am prepared to place you in a 
position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving 
relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half and 
no more. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the 
deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50. I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be 
released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming 
the deposit. But on the other hand, you with a similar name as the original depositor would 
easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim. I assure you that I could have the 
deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of 
the file relating to the customer. I will then officially communicate with the finance company 
and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done.
The alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as 
accountholder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the 
firm. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the consequences of this 
proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this 
mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, 
delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do 
not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy 
sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal 
and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, 
but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come 
ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by
I hope you understand because for once I found myself in total control and face to face with 
my destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you 
will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am 
a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a 
reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks 
and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am 
the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has 
planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing.
If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to 
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about 
this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do 
I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through this email 
address (qin_wang1@o2.pl)
I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as 
they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total 
Quality Management Policy.
Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man; I happily 
married with two kids. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the 
consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that 
success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have 
learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one 
accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.
I await your response.
Sincerely,
Qin Wang

Dear Sir,
This contact is being made to you out of the increase need. Ostensibly, this may some what aroused some kind of surprise and suspicion both by its source, method or channel of transmission. It may also, be seen unjustifiable based on rules of certain values, but certain concerns and considerations has increased quite immeasurably and contemptuously in me, hence my approach.
I am DR BENNARD ABAH a member of the movement for Democratic Change in ZIMBABWE? My party is opposed to the ZANU-PF of the incumbent president ROBERT MUGBE. I went into a partnership with a white farmer and businessman in ZIMBABWE and as we progressed in business, I bought his ideas and philosophy, which made me join the movement for democratic change which is dominated by the white (of which my colleague is a top member).
We control the greater portion of the white-dominated farms in ZIMBABWE and we are major shareholder in major companies in ZIMBABWE. The MUGABE government and his political associate are not tolerant to the activities of the movement for democratic change and he is using indirect guerrilla war tactics to oppress the members.
ZIMBABWE war veterans invaded our farms and confiscated some of our assets and held us hostage. I manage to escape from their brutality but my business partner died in the struggle. He left a message that I should sell off our assets including the farms, estates and the companies, ensuring that his family relocates overseas and also to invest the money properly bearing in mind that the next step of the guerrillas will be to confiscate those remaining assets.
I have successfully sold off the remaining portion of our estates, tobacco farms and companies after which I managed with the help of the immigration officer to sneak into JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA, with the money and my colleague's families. In fact, we are seeking refuge in SOUTH AFRICA at this moment. The total sum in our possession at hand is the sum USD36 MILLION realized from auction, sales of the estates, tobacco farms and companies. The money is secured in a security company. We are being highly restricted by the South African Authorities in opening up bank accounts here thereby adding more pain to the existing sorrows; a good study has also shown that South African as a base for our asylum is not the bests of a choice.
Evidences available show that South African is a nation in crisis, a fractured and bitterly divided nation since after apartheids rule, not suitable for good and strong investments.
It is an irony that the level of crimes, corruptions, mistrusts, mischief in the country is seemed to have for years endangered the economic development and has scared foreigner's investors away from investing in the country.
I wish to link up some one with strong characters who I can trust and enter into an understanding with and some one with good knowledge of investment to administer funds into business. This should be done under none-disclosure and none circumvention framework.
I have lots of drawbacks in the South African environment as issues in the country does not seem to go far enough to guarantee hope, trust in investment.
Please, if I can have your confidence, trust and understanding in this matter, I will be glad to have you contact me with this email address:tendand@webmail.co.za
Please, this is not a case of money laundering of illicit funds.
I have 2 options for you; the 1st is that you could choose to have 25% of money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you could as well go into a joint business partnership with me for proper investment of the fund in any best choice of your wish once the money is transferred into your
Overseas account.
Best regards,ASSIST ME

Dear Friend,
ASSISTANCE
Kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself. I am GEORGE KABILA,the son
of the former head of state/president of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zaire)
Mr.Laurent Desire Kabila.
I am contacting you in other to ask for your assistance on this confidential
Business proposal with full financial benefit for both of us.
Before I go into further details please be informed that I am writing without
any other person(s)
pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this transaction.
Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.
I have the sum of USD20.7Million from a secret sale of Diamond by my father
before he was assassinated by one of his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th
2001, which I will like you to receive on my behalf due to Security reasons, as
my narration below will explain.
But before I continue be well informed that your share in this transaction has
been calculated as 15% of the total sum of USD$20.7M, 5% for expenses and the
rest for my family and I.
My father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having
married to so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my father, My
step brother Joseph, who is currently the  president of my country, is the son
of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.
Already president Joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and
private property, which my late father left behind for the entire family.
Now my mother and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late
father's wealth. Our situation is seriously critical that we need your
assistance to help us receive this money overseas for proper investment.
Let me quickly assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free because the
diamond sales are packaged from  the unset in a pattern that shows no direct
trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the money is deposited and
is secured with a holding company under deposit account.
I am waiting for your swift and favourable response, and in case you have any
question(s), do not hesitate to contact me.
My alternative e mail address is : gkabila@hispavista.com

Business Proposal. 
Good Day, 
With warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity. My name is Jacob Kamala the son of Mr. A.Y Kamala, a farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instinct, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for now. 
I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers. Actually all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infect to his political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an opposition party that did not support the president's idea. There after he then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They killed my father and took away a lot of items from his farm. After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my father handed us over his will documents with instructions from my father that we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will document has a certificate of deposit, confirming a cash deposit totaling Fifteen million five hundred thousand united state dollars. [15.5m] kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as personal belongings. 
This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana. This violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of my beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe with the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach him but all to no avail. I am currently staying in the South Africa where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security company from Zimbabwe, has a branch here, I have contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in Johannesburg here, which they have since done. Therefore I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money. Since the law of South Africa prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can be transferred, hence this proposal to you. 
You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big and brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company's office here in South Africa, as it has now been transferred from Zimbabwe, Johannesburg South Africa to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you. 
Firstly you can choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I have also set aside 1 % of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4% for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left in the account here for me. 
Unless otherwise indicate or obvious from the nature of this transmittal, the information contained in this email message is privileged and confidential information intended for the use of the individual or entity named above. If the reader of this message in not intended recipient, or the employee or agent responsible to deliver it to the recipient, you are hereby notified that any dissemination, distribution or coping of this communication is strictly prohibited.

Governor of Bayelsa State of Republic of Nigeria I know
that it may surprise you being emailed by a strange Woman
from African country asking for urgent assistance in an

http://www.nigeriaworld.com
Because of this terrible experience I decided that morning
about the money (USD$120Millions) left behind here in state
house,I was afraid of putting the fund in the Bank, because
I have to give account to the bank on how I got the money.
I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited the
consignments with a security/courier company. I did not
want the management of the Security Company to know the
content of the consignments, therefore I registered the
content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security
company believes that  what I deposited with them was Gold
Bars.
I have notified the Security Company where I deposited the
consignments that contained the fund, that I am moving the
consignment abroad and the security company has since been
waiting for my authority for the consignment to leave my
country and move to abroad.
If you know that you handle .receive such big funds
honestly and wisely , then do contact me back first through
this my email:  Mrs.DiepreyeAlamieyeseigha@hotmail.com
We have set assude 20% percentage of the cash will be
your's after you receive the consignment/funds. Then you
will open an account in your country with my name and
deposit our 80% percentage of the cash.I want to inform you
that if you are able to receive this money your percentage
will increase after subsequent deals if you prove your
reliability in this deal Please don't involve a third party
in this deal because of the nature of the deal and also as
a public figure my husband may be implicated by the third
person And don't dispose any document of this deal to any
body except when we ask you to do so, Note that this
transaction involves no risk whatsoever for you will have
NO dealing with my country Nigeria goverment Rather, you
will deal directly with the security courier company . 
Let me have your confidential Details YOUR FULL
NAME,PHYSICAL MAILING ADDRESS,PHONE AND FAX NUMBER (Which i
will give to the company to ship the consignment to you
immediately) in your response to this proposal   .
This matter should be treated as urgent and confidential as
possible please
Best regards
Mrs. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha
First Lady

"How to turn �into �,000" 
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but with a little effort will make a nice little return - perhaps pay off that credit card after the Xmas spend, or pay for that much needed holiday
Please take the time to read the following information, which I received recently.
Please try not to be sceptical about this program and at least think about it for a few days, otherwise you could be throwing away over �,000 in cash! This system has worked for 2 years and the thousands of people, who joined, have been amazed by the results of giving a little time and just �00 (�5/$5.00).
In March of 2003, I received a short and simple e-mail telling me how to make over �,000 at a time. Of course I ignored it, but I didn't delete the mail, as there was something about it which rang true and I was keen to know if it was possible to make that amount of money in such a short space of time. I was at that time getting deep in debt. I finally realized that I had absolutely nothing to lose by having a go at the plan offered to me in that email. And apart from that, I just couldn't stop myself from thinking "What if it actually works?" For the sake of �isn't it worth a go!
I put my doubts to one side, went ahead and followed the simple instructions given in that email. It took me less than 30 minutes to complete and it cost me no more than �(�5/$5). 
What did it say in that email? Well, if you'll read on, all will be revealed! 
The business plan I am about to share with you works perfectly every single time. I've never made less than �,000 from it on each occasion. Let me assure you that this is a LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, a perfectly legal moneymaking enterprise. It does not require you to sell anything. It does not require you to speak to your friends, family or anybody else (unless you want to). 
This must sound like an outrageous claim, particularly if you've never had possession of this sort of money before, but believe me, this business works like nothing else you may have seen before in your life! By following the simple 3-step plan set out below, within a few short weeks your life could be transformed beyond all recognition! 
Please do not allow your initial scepticism to deprive you of financial success. 
This program is by no means new. It has been in existence in many forms for at least a decade. But in the early days, it required a lot more time and effort, as well as an outlay of a few hundred pounds. However, thanks to PayPal and the Internet, the outlay is now virtually ZERO! And what's more, the entire process is FASTER, EASIER, and MORE LUCRATIVE than it has EVER been! 
This program works no matter what country you are in, or what currency you use. It doesn't matter how old or how young you are. And you certainly won't need any special knowledge or talent. You won't need to run a website, or make phone calls, or make photocopies, or send out letters through the mail, or pay for advertising, etc. 
You will need:
�	An email address 
�	A Premier or Business PayPal account with at least �(�5/$5) deposited in it 
�	30 minutes of your time 
PayPal is the simplest method of sending and receiving payments online that anyone has ever seen! Once you have a PayPal account, you can send and receive credit card payments to or from anyone - anywhere in the world! However, please read further before you visit their website. 
To get started, follow the instructions exactly as set out below and then prepare yourself for an influx of cash over the next 30 days! 
Here's what you need to do:
STEP 1: If you're not already a PayPal user, the very first thing you need to do is click on the PayPal link below and SIGN UP. It takes just 2 minutes.
http:/www.paypal.com 
STEP 2: When you have opened your account, send a �(�5/$5) payment from your PayPal account to the FIRST email address in the list below, along with a note saying: 
" Please add me to your mailing list. " 
Be certain to add this note, as this is what KEEPS THIS PROGRAM LEGAL. Instructions on how to send a payment are under "SEND MONEY" at the PayPal site. It's that easy!! 
Here's the current list: 
1.	hurst_l@lineone.net
2.	admin@makinscentz.com
3.	tracy@chezmoi79.freeserve.co.uk
4.	charlotte2012@hotmail.co.uk
5.	kingsley.enterprise@tiscali.co.uk
STEP 3: Once you've sent a �(�5/$5) payment to the address at the top of the list (along with your note - this is VERY important!), the next thing to do is copy the contents of this page, as you'll be sending it out (as an email message) to at least 40 people, although with the legitimate mailing lists and the different ways of advertising on the internet, e.g. Ebay, the amount of recipients of your mail could well exceed into the hundreds, thousands or even millions if you wish. The more people who join in, the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going to use a mailing list, please make sure it is from a reputable source and includes people who have "Opted In". These lists contain names of people who have no objections to receiving these types of mails. 
The e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any way you want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it).
Delete the e-mail address at No 1 in the list and move the others up one place (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2 etc)
No 5 in the list will be empty, so put YOUR address in this space. (This is the e-mail address you used to sign up to PayPal), your email is now ready for sending! 
A word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! If you do that, you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to, and then your address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you won't reach any more people! However, if you add your name to the No 5 position, there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending e-mail's later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!! 
When you send out your e-mails, your address will initially be at No 5 in the list. The response-rate for this program is much higher than any typical email marketing campaign for a number of reasons, which are explained later. 
As long as you send your e-mails to people who are likely to be interested in this program, you can expect an average response from about 25% of the people you send to. Let's be conservative here and assume that you receive only an average response rate of 12.5%. 
If you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 40 = 5). By this time, your email address will have moved up to No 4 in the list, and this list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40). 
Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to participate (12.5% of 200 = 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails (25 x 40) being sent out and your email address will have risen to No 3 in the list. 
Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to participate (12.5% of 1,000 = 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails (125 x 40) being sent out with you now at the No 2 position. 
Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to respond (12.5% of 5,000 = 625), so that's 25,000 emails (625 x 40) being sent out with YOUR ADDRESS at the No 1 spot! 
Now, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to respond (12.5% of 25,000 = 3,125). And since you will now be at No 1 in the list, you will receive �(�5/$5) from each of them, that's; �375 (3,125 x ��5/$5).
So, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few days, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days the money will be sent to you, by a few thousand people just like yourself. The first payments will arrive within a few days, and they will continue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After that time, the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail address vacates the No 1 position. " Please add me to your mailing list. "

STEP 1: If you're not already a PayPal user, the very first thing you need to do is click on the PayPal link below and SIGN UP. It takes just 2 minutes.
http:/www.paypal.com 
STEP 2: When you have opened your account, send a �(�5/$5) payment from your PayPal account to the FIRST email address in the list below, along with a note saying: 
" Please add me to your mailing list. " 
Be certain to add this note, as this is what KEEPS THIS PROGRAM LEGAL. Instructions on how to send a payment are under "SEND MONEY" at the PayPal site. It's that easy!! 
Here's the current list: 
1.	hurst_l@lineone.net
2.	admin@makinscentz.com
3.	tracy@chezmoi79.freeserve.co.uk
4.	charlotte2012@hotmail.co.uk
5.	kingsley.enterprise@tiscali.co.uk
STEP 3: Once you've sent a �(�5/$5) payment to the address at the top of the list (along with your note - this is VERY important!), the next thing to do is copy the contents of this page, as you'll be sending it out (as an email message) to at least 40 people, although with the legitimate mailing lists and the different ways of advertising on the internet, e.g. Ebay, the amount of recipients of your mail could well exceed into the hundreds, thousands or even millions if you wish. The more people who join in, the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going to use a mailing list, please make sure it is from a reputable source and includes people who have "Opted In". These lists contain names of people who have no objections to receiving these types of mails. 
The e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any way you want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it).
Delete the e-mail address at No 1 in the list and move the others up one place (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2 etc)
No 5 in the list will be empty, so put YOUR address in this space. (This is the e-mail address you used to sign up to PayPal), your email is now ready for sending! 
A word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! If you do that, you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to, and then your address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you won't reach any more people! However, if you add your name to the No 5 position, there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending e-mail's later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!! 
When you send out your e-mails, your address will initially be at No 5 in the list. The response-rate for this program is much higher than any typical email marketing campaign for a number of reasons, which are explained later. 
As long as you send your e-mails to people who are likely to be interested in this program, you can expect an average response from about 25% of the people you send to. Let's be conservative here and assume that you receive only an average response rate of 12.5%. 
If you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 40 = 5). By this time, your email address will have moved up to No 4 in the list, and this list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40). 
Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to participate (12.5% of 200 = 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails (25 x 40) being sent out and your email address will have risen to No 3 in the list. 
Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to participate (12.5% of 1,000 = 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails (125 x 40) being sent out with you now at the No 2 position. 
Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to respond (12.5% of 5,000 = 625), so that's 25,000 emails (625 x 40) being sent out with YOUR ADDRESS at the No 1 spot! 
Now, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to respond (12.5% of 25,000 = 3,125). And since you will now be at No 1 in the list, you will receive �(�5/$5) from each of them, that's; �375 (3,125 x ��5/$5).
So, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few days, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days the money will be sent to you, by a few thousand people just like yourself. The first payments will arrive within a few days, and they will continue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After that time, the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail address vacates the No 1 position. TREAT VERY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT...

DR.SANOU BELLO
Dear,
I am the head of Accounts and Audit Department of Bank of Africa,
Ouagadougou . I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may 
be capable of handling this business transaction which i explained below;
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten 
million, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to 
one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 2000  
in a plane crash.
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his 
supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim .
It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his busines 
asociate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed Bill.
The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
Unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner .
We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me and my 
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for 
disbursement according to the percentages indicated.
Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your account as 
arranged,you must apply first to the bank as next of kin of the deceased 
customer. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the 
text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.
I expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Hoping to hear from you immediately.
Yours faithfully,
DR .SANOU BELLO

http://messenger.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200471ave/direct/01/FROM ROBERT CAN YOU HELP ME OUT? IS VERY URGENT
Dear Sir,
With a very desperate need for assistance, I have summed up courage
to contact you. I am from (will disclose this later), presently
working in Iraq with an international organisation that I will also
disclose later, I found your contact particulars in an
address journal.
I am seeking your assistance to evacuate the sum of (US$8.523
Million Dollars) Eight Million five Hundred Thousand And Twenty
Three Dollars to
your country or any other safe country of your choice, as far as I can be
assured that my share will be safe in your care untill I complete
my service here,this is no stolen money, and there are no dangers involved.
SOURCE OF MONEY:
Some money in various currencies was discovered concealed in
barrels with piles of weapons and ammunitions at a location near one
of Saddam,s old palaces during a rescue operation, and it was
agreed by all party present that the money be shared amongst us, this
was quite an illegal thing to do, but I tell you what? no
compensation can make up for the risks we have taken with our lives
in this hell hole.
The above figure was given to me as my share, and to conceal this
kind of money became a problem for me, so with the help of a German
contact working here, and his office enjoys some immunity, I was able
to get the package out to a safe cation entirely out of trouble
spot. He does not know the real contents of the package, and
believes that it
belongs to an Asian/American who died in an air raid, and before giving
up, trusted me to hand over the package to his business associate. I
have now found a secured way of getting the package out to a safer
country for you to pick up, and will discuss this with you when I am
sure that you are willing to assist me.
One passionate appeal I will make to you is not to discuss this
matter with a third party, should you have reasons to reject
this offer, please destroy this mail as any leakage of this
information will be too bad for us.
I do not know for how long we will remain here, and I have
survived 2 suicide bomb attacks by the special grace of God, this and
other reasons I will mention later has prompted me to reach out for help, I
honestly want this matter to be resolved immediately. Please contact
me as soon as possible.
Regards,
Robert Taylor

        From Aiash Kone,
Adjame,Cote d'ivoire
Dear Father & mother
I am Aisha Kone 22 years old and the only daughter   
of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.Kone.My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the pital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad ,12th.Feb 002.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth!
My mother died when I was just 4 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before
his death on Febuary 12 2002 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told her that he had a sum of 7 000,000 US DOLLARS (Seven) MILLION U.S DOLLARS)kept in a security company in (ABIDJAN),Cote D'ivoire,
He also said that the security company does not know the content of the safe Box.He decleared it as family treasure,He also explained to him that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business associates, That I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where I will transfer this money to and use it for investment purposes.
I want you to assist me in clearing this box(fund)from the security company and then tranfer the fund into your account overseas as a beneficiary of the fund,and also use it for an investment purpose. I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't
know what to do.Now I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds.
This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.Dearest one,I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.
Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter 
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of the total amount in question
will be good for you after the money is in your
account?
Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as
possible.
Thank you so much.
sincere regards,
Miss.Aisha Kone.

Victoria Island,
Lagos-Nigeria
RE:Attention,
I am barrister RAMOS HAMZA, the Legal Adviser and counsel to adeceased 
expatriate contractor (Eng.Arthur) who used to work with Zenith Oil and 
Gas Company here in Nigeria thereafter shall be referred to as my late 
client.
On the 26th December 2004, my client and his entire family died while
on Vacation at Phuket Island in Thailand as a result of the Asia Earth
Quake Disaster(TSUNAMI DISASTER) You will read more stories about the 
crash  on  visiting this
http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2004/tsunami.disaster/
Meanwhile, On the 6th of January 2005,I recieved a phone call as his
personal Attorney where the tragic news of my clients death in the
Tsunami disaster was broke to me.
And since then, I have made several enquiries to locate any of his
extended relatives.This has proved unsuccessful hence I contacted you
in my attempt to trace any member of his family over the internet.
Therefore, I am seeking  your consent and assistance in repartriating
money  left behind by my late client before it gets confiscated or
declared unserviceable by the bank where the deposit is
lodged. The deposit is valued US$5,200,000.00 (Five Million; Two
Thousand  United States Dollars) only and it is lodged with Linkworld
International  Bank Nigeria Plc.
The management board of the bank, after their executive meeting
fortnight  ago, mandated me to provide his next of kin to inherit the
funds  the deceased left behind or else, it will be declared non 
claimable hence the bankers intend to invoke the abandoned property 
decree of 1996 to confiscate the funds after the expiration of the 
period given to me.
I hereby seek your consent to present you to the bank as next-of-kin of
the deceased, so that the proceeds of this account valued
US$5,200,000.00 can be transferred to you as the heir to the deceased, 
and thereafter  you,and I will share the money at the ratio of 50% to 
me and 45% to you,  while 5% will be donated to the Tsunami Disaster 
Charity Fund.
I guarantee that the transaction will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law hence all
the necessary legal documents that will be required of you by the
management of the bank in backing up your claims will be duly processed 
and obtained from the necessary authorities.
To commence this process, it is very important that you provide with me
the following information,
1.Your name and contact address in full.
2.Your Telephone and fax numbers.
3.Your Occupation/company's name and address.
4.Your age and marital status.
As soon as I recieve the above stated information, I will file-in a
formal application on your behalf to the bank for them to commence the
process of  transferring the fund into your designated bank account as 
the next  of kin to my deceased client.
Yours truly,
RAMOS HAMZA (ESQ)This letter must come to you as a big surprise.
Greetings to you,
This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a 
day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. My name 
is Mr.Emme Harry. the present branch Manager of a bank here in Benin 
Republic West Africa. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing 
that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like 
I said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your 
assistance is required as a foreigner.
I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office, but last 
December I was asked to take osition of a Manager of our branch in Cotonou 
who passed on, so that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a 
fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $18.1 
million that has not been operated on for the past 3 years. From my 
investigation, I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr.  HAJI 
EL JAMAL ZOUE, a citizen of Lebanon who died on the recent plane crash in 
Cotonou Benin republic on the 26th of Dec. 2003 You can seach the Webside.
site;http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html )
I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come 
forward to claim the money as next of kin to the Late Mr  HAJI EL JAMAL 
ZOUE, meaning that no one is aware of the account.
I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and 
that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and 
share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power 
influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the 
next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the 
account, which I shall give you. I am seeking your co-operation to present 
you as the next of kin to the account. There is practically no risk 
involved, the transaction will be executed undera legitimate arrangement 
that will protect you from any breach of law.
If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share 
the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me 
as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together, so as 
to give you more details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. 
Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.
Meanwhile, I will like to speak with you on phone for more information.  
Please you are to keep this transaction a top secret in view of my sensitive 
position at the bank.
#NOTE: These are required of you.
(1) Your full Name.
(2) Your personal phone number.
(3) Your Address
Thanks and have a nice day.

DEAR:SIR/MADAM
I am Mr Joel Taylor I work with the office of the Director, Foreign 
Operation Department of Eco Bank NIG. PLC, Lagos Branch. It happened On the 
2nd of May 1999, Engr. S. BARNHILL, an AMERICAN  from New Orleans who used 
to work with Shell Petroleum Development Company In Nigeria (SPDC), Mr Engr. 
S. BARNHILL, his wife And their three children were involved in a car 
accident along Shagamu Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle 
unfortunately lost their lives. Since then, Eco Bank NIG. PLC have made 
several enquiries to  embassies to locate any of the extended relatives, 
this has also proved unsuccessful.
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives 
over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence 
I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money 
that belong to Mr Engr. S. BARNHILL, before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged. 
Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about 
$18.6 Million Dollars has issued a notice to provide the next of kin or have 
the account confiscated within the next ten official working days.
Since bank have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3 years 
now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased, 
so that the proceeds of this account valued at $18.6 Million Dollars can be 
paid to you and then you and me can share the money,50% to me and 45% to 
you, while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may require, 
I have the Certificate of deposit that can be used to back up any claim we 
may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this 
deal through.
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by 
my email to enable us discuss further.
Thank you

FROM THE DESK OF : DR HASSAN DANTATA,
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,
AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK ( A.D.B )
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.
Attention Please,
I am Dr Hassan Dantata, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting 
section of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West 
Africa. With due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a 
business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end 
of the transaction .
During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in a 
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank 
without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or 
relation before our discovery to this development.
The said amount was U.S 7.5M (Seven Million,Five Hundred Thousand United 
States Dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive 
information through internet directory . Meanwhile all the whole arrangement 
to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get 
the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been 
put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as 
soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist, and also 
benefit your self to this great business opportunity.
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it will 
require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin 
with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign 
account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his 
request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the 
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from 
to your own designation bank account.
I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone and 
internet bills, while 60% will be for me and my coleagues. Please, you have 
been adviced to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in service and intend to 
retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.
I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in. All other necessary vital nformation will be sent to you when 
I hear from you.
I look forward to receive your phone and fax numbers for easy communication,
Yours faithfully,
Dr Hassan Dantata

Qin Wang
Lloyds TSB Pacific Limited
Hong Kong Branch Two Exchange
Square Central, Hong Kong.
Attention,
Thank you for giving me your time, it is of great importance for you to take
care and understand every word which I have written down below; please be
patient and read the explanation in my email.
I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc. here in Hong Kong attached in Private
Banking Services, I am contacting you concerning a customer and an investment
placed under our banks management; as a matter of factit was 3 years ago. I
would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail private and
also to kindly respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result
of this email. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is
informed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with certain facts
that I believe would be of interest to you.
In 2001, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/958/042/0500 came to our bank to engage
in business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He
informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 15.37 million United States
Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the
officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties
as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services
epartment,especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.
We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and however
I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The
favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600
traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternative
investments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities
and made attractive margins for our first months of operation,the accrued profit
with interest included, stood at this point at over 16.2 million United States
Dollars,this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low
risk guaranteed returns on investments.In mid 2002, he asked that the money be
liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash
payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited
with a firm in Europe. I informed him that our bank would have to make special
arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the
bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking
and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around
when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.
Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of
9/11. I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainland
Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise
instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security
consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits
from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable
products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This
small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly
placed and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money
was deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his
arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had,
this transpired aroundbFebruary 25th 2003. In June last year, we got a call
from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular
portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the
fact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about
the deposit, and I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his
deposit.
I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating
him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days later,
information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead, a person who
suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of
France; we were soon enough able to gather more information and the cause of
death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into
possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come
forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs,
those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels
of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no
next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means
no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name;
depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also
gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the
bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said,
rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not
nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in
this case; he died Intestate.
In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we
instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have
right to claim the estate, this investigation for several months were futile.
We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate
companies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that
resulted in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being
as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the estate
even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the deceased).My
official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the
investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation.
What this means, with you being a foreigner, I have considered the fact that
our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This
leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing
situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the
deposit. According to practice, the firm shall by the end of this financial
year broadcast a request for statements of claim to our bank, failing to
receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to our
bank.This will result in the money entering our bank's accounting system and
the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services
Department. This will not happen if I have my way.
What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I want
you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking world who
finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of
private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy
certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you should have begun by now to
put together the general direction of what I propose. There is USD$
15,991,674(Thirteen million, nine hundred and ninety one thousand, six hundred
and seventy four united states dollars) deposited, I alone have the deposit
details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do
I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm is
concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the
funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just
customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single idea of what's
the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to
release the deposit to any party that comes forward, and this is the situation.
This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of the
deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family but
however the investigation has officially come to an end.
My proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction is
given to the finance firm to officially release the deposit to you as the
closest surviving relation/associate, and all etiquette shall be done in
accordance with the rule of law, I certainly can guarantee you that. By the
common law,the power of bequeathing is coeval with the first rudiments of the
law, and this power has been extended to all a man's Personal and Real estate
(Personalty & Realty). There is no ruling which prevents an inheritance from
being so exhausted by legacies as to render it unworthy of the heir's
acceptance; basically all persons of sound mind are competent to bequeath and
devise real and personal estate, excepting infants, with all this I would say
we have the clear advantage to carry out a smooth and perfect operation whereby
the paper work shall be coordinated in such a way that your status as a sole
beneficiary is confirmed. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share
the money with you in half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as
the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share
the proceeds 50/50.
I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have
drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit, but on
the other hand, you as a indifferent foreigner would easily pass as the
beneficiary with the rights to claim, I assure you that I could have the
deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the
final closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then officially
communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit
to you; with these two things: all is done.The alternative would be for us to
have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder, this
way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm.
We can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the consequences
of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest in this project that
you should discard this mail. I ask also, that you do not be vindictive or
destructive, if my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget
I ever contacted you; please not destroy my career because you do not approve of
my proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums
out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard
for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this
move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let
this chance pass me by and I hope you understand,because for once I found
myself in total control and face to face with my destiny. These chances won't
pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with
me please let me know, and hence move on with my life, but do not destroy me; I
am a family man and this is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities.
There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I
have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to
work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who knows of this
situation,good fortune will bless you and plant you into the center of
relevance in my life, let?s share the blessing.
If you find yourself interested to work with me,please contact me specifically,
through this email account mrqinwang1954@netscap.net if you give me positive
signals, I will initiate this process towards a quick conclusion.It is
necessary to inform you that under no condition should you contact me via
official channels; I will simply deny knowing you and about this project. I
repeat, I do not want you contacting me through our official lines neither do I
want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only
through this email address above; I do not want any direct link between you and
me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to
assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management
policy, please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a
family man; I happily married with kids, I send you this mail not without a
measure of fear as to what the consequences might be, but I know within me that
nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy
or on a platter of gold,this is the one truth I have learned from my private
banking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord I
shall have the pleasure of meeting you, after this task has been completed we
can plan a meeting.
I await your response.
Yours Sincerely,
Qin WangCALLING FOR HELP
  From Paul Kamara
Abidjan Cote D' I voire.
Email:paul_kamara@yahoo.com 
Dear One,
For my safety and security of my future I am making this proposal to you for our mutual benefit. This however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour it against your will. I am Paul Kamara, 23 years old and the only son of my late parents Mr.and Mrs. Kamara. My father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously during one of his business trips abroad on the 4th october. 2005. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 2 years old,
and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on 4th october, 2005 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of nine million, one hundred and fifty thousand United State Dollars.(USD$9.150,000) deposited in a bank here in Abidjan which he use my name as next of kin.
He further told him that he deposited the money with my name as the next of kin, and finally told him to tell me where to find the documents of the deposit which he said was in possession of his lawyer in sealed documents held by him and asked me to collect it from him and all the necessary documents to this fund. I am just 23 years old and a first year university undergraduate and really don't know what to do.
Now I want a trust worthy person who can help me to transfer this money  and provide an account overseas where I can transfer this funds.This is because I have suffered a lot
of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.
Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
1. Can you honestly take me as your own and help me.
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you after the money is in your account?
Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible so that i can forward the documents to you after we have agreed on the conditions for your assistance. My life is not safe here and i need to be out of here as soon as possible because now that my father is dead and with me only as a male child, my uncles will be seeking to kill me so that they can have all my fathers properties. i really don't want to
struggle anything with them in terms of properties but my presence will still be disturbing them. thank God they are not aware of this fund in the bank hence, I want to leave here as soon as you help me to lodge it into  a safe account in your stable country and then send me some amount to enable me prepare to meet you. Without your help, i will find it difficult to travel and transfer it myself alone with my little or no experience.
I am waiting for your urgent reply with your contact phone number so that i can give you the contact of the bank were my late father deposited this money 
for you to contact them as  my late father's partner. 
Thank you so much.
My sincere regards
Paul Kamara.

Dear friend,
Thanks for your concern to my proposal. I am Mr Mark 
Hernandez the linkman between the Organization For Petroleum Exporting 
Countries - OPEC and World Bank. I also attend OPEC meetings 
constantly 
in Geneva Switzerland on the auspices of World Bank.
Through the sale 
of our allocated oil quota in OPEC, I was able to 
makeS$22.2million, 
which is currently deposited in a Security firm 
abroad. I want you to 
assist me to claim this money as I cannot claim 
it directly because i 
am still a Civil servant in active service, and 
the code of conduct 
bureau forbids me to acquire such huge amount of 
money.
It is on this 
basis that I am contacting you for assistance, 
If You will be 
interested, and all claim documents will be processed, 
and sent to you. 
The documents with which the fund is deposited will 
be changed to 
reflect you as the new beneficiary so that you will be 
eligible to 
collect the fund on my behalf.
I will give you 30% of the 
fund for 
this assistance, while 60% will be for me and 10% will be for 
expenses 
that may be incurred on both sides. I am aware of the 
international 
monitoring of all large-scale financial movements after 
the September 
11th 2001 Terrorist attack on America (USA) and to avoid 
any state of 
financial Investigation I will provide a classified 
clearance paper 
from the relevant body, which will exonerate the money 
from drug, money 
laundered or terrorist related funds.
Kindly respond 
to my proposal 
through this my private email on the receipt of your 
mail indicating 
interest. I want to assure you that this is 100% risk 
free. I will give 
you more details concerning this as soon as I 
received your swift 
response which must include your full names, 
address, occupation, age 
phone and fax number.

Thank you for giving me your time,it is of great importance for you to

I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc here in Hong Kong attached in

What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice  
but I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the  
banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world  
aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with  
huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain  
portfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general  
direction of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I  
alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no  
one unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of  
this deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the  
transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds  
to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are  
just customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single  
idea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply  
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes  
forward, and this is the situation.
This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family  
of the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no  
family but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal;  
I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm  
to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon  
receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in  
half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of  
kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the  
proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to  
me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement  
in claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent  
foreigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to  
claim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a  
few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the  
file relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with  
the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you;  
with these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to  
have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account  
holder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving  
the money from the firm.
We can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the  
consequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest  
in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that  
you do not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal

These chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my  
chance, if you will not work with me please let me know, and hence  
move on with my life, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and  
this is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities. There is a

have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you  
refusing to work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who

If you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me

you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a

http://www.lloydstsb.com.hk
Thank you for giving me your time,it is of great importance for you to  
take care and understand every word which I have written down below;  
please be patient and read my email.
I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc here in Hong Kong attached in  
Private Banking Services. I am contacting you concerning a customer  
and an investment placed under our banks management; as a matter of  
fact it was 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep  
the contents of this mail private and also to kindly respect the  
integrity of the information you come by as a result of this email.I  
contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is  
informed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with  
certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.
In 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank  
to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services  
Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37  
million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over  
(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made  
numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief  
operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department,  
especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.  
We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed,  
and however I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with  
prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start  
by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200  
managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the  
money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our  
first months of operation, the accrued profit with interest included,  
stood at this point at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this  
margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk  
guaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the  
money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment  
requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the  
funds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe.I informed him that  
our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and  
in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a  
9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory  
charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I  
explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.  
Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the  
incidents of 9/11.
I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in  
mainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I  
followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds  
deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist  
private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and  
blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake  
transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly  
private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and  
well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was  
deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his  
arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication  
we had, this transpired around February 25th 2002. In June last year,  
we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of  
that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I  
was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking  
sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not  
understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I made  
futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating  
him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days  
later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead,  
a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart  
attack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather  
more information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank  
immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of  
kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his  
estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who  
patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels  
of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he  
listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an  
account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are  
rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the  
accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of  
having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring  
that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they  
nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not  
nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our  
care, in this case; he died in testate.
In line with our internal processes for account holders who have  
passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to  
determine who should have right to claim the estate, this  
investigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every  
continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to  
get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted  
in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being  
as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the  
estate even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the  
deceased).My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to  
supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results  
of the investigation. What this means, with you being a foreigner, I  
have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known  
or identifiable family member.
This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the  
prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late  
beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by  
the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of  
claim to our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most  
probably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the  
money entering our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be  
out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department.  
This will not happen if I have my way.
What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice  
but I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the  
banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world  
aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with  
huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain  
portfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general  
direction of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I  
alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no  
one unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of  
this deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the  
transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds  
to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are  
just customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single  
idea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply  
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes  
forward, and this is the situation.
This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family  
of the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no  
family but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal;  
I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm  
to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon  
receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in  
half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of  
kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the  
proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to  
me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement  
in claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent  
foreigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to  
claim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a  
few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the  
file relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with  
the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you;  
with these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to  
have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account  
holder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving  
the money from the firm.
We can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the  
consequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest  
in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that  
you do not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal  
to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please  
not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You  
may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of  
comparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a  
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this  
may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry  
dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way  
once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you  
understand, because for once I found myself in total control and face  
to face with my destiny.
These chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my  
chance, if you will not work with me please let me know, and hence  
move on with my life, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and  
this is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities. There is a  
reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I  
have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you  
refusing to work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who  
knows of this situation, good fortune will bless you and plant you  
into the center of relevance in my life, let’s share the blessing.
If you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me  
specifically, through this email account (qin2wang2000@yahoo.com.cn),  
if you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards  
a conclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition  
should you contact me via official channels; I will simply deny  
knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you  
contacting me through our official lines neither do I want you  
contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only  
through this email address above; I do not want any direct link  
between you and me.My official lines are not secure lines as they are  
periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line  
with our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this  
instruction religiously.
Please, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two  
kids, I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what  
the consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured  
is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a  
platter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private  
banking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one

Dear friend.
I know that this letter may come to you as a surprise.I got your address 
through a local Business directory on the web.I must apologize for taking 
some of your valuable time to explain a proposal that I believe will be of 
utmost benefit to us.
I am manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of 
African Developement Bank.(A.D.B.) In my department we discovered an 
abandoned sum of NINTEEN MILLION, THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS ($19,300,000.00 ) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer who died along with his entire family in a plane crash .you can 
also confirm this in the website as
Since the bank got information about his death we have been expecting his 
next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the 
fund unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately 
we learnt that all his supposed next of kin died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim and our banking law and 
guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five 
years,such money will be moved into the banking treasurer as unclaimed fund.
The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by 
the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot 
stand as next of kin. 25% of the total money will be for you as a foreign 
partner while 5% will be set asite to cover any expenses that might be 
incured during the process of transfering the fund to your nominated bank 
account.
If you're willing to handle this deal with me kind get back to me with your 
Private telephone and fax numbers for easy communicationas well as your 
personal picture or a copy of your international passport to enable me know 
whom i'm dealling with.
Meanwhile, i will send to you an  application form which you will fill and 
send  directly to the bank.
Note:I demand the hightest trust from you to keep this business strictly 
confidential for security reasons as you may know that the bank don't know 
that i am the one that contacted you to stand for this claim.
Best regards,
Mr Henry Kabore

19 KINGSWAY ROAD, IKOYI LAGOS NIGERIA.
Dear Friend
I am Barrister and a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Dr Adams, a 
national of your country, who used to work with CADBURY NIGERIA LIMITED, on 
the 21st of April 2004, my client, his wife and their three children were 
involved in a car accident along Sagamu Lagos Express Road.
Unfortunately they All lost their lives in the event of the accident,
Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my 
clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these 
several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his elatives over the 
Internet to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I 
contacted you. I contacted you to assist in retrieving the money and 
property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposit were lodged.
Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about 
US$10.5M (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United Stated 
dollars).Consequently, the bank issued me a notice to provide the next of 
kin or have the account confiscated. Since I have been unsuccessful in 
locating the relatives for over 2 years now.
I seek your consent to help me in the search of the next of kin of the 
deceased or will you accept the offer to stand as the next of kin Since you 
are from the same country, so that the proceeds of this account valued at 
US$10.5MD can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money. 50% to 
me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for expenses or tax as your 
government may require. I have all necessary legal documents that can be 
used to back up any claim we may make.

FROM THE DESK OF ( MR.YSOUF AROUNA)
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT /FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)OUAGADOUGOU -BF
REQUEST FOR THE URGENT TRANSFER OF THE SUM (US$10.5million) ONLY INTO YOUR 
ACCOUNT.
You may be surprise to receive this message from me since you don't know me 
in person, but for the purpose of introduction., I got your impressive 
information through an international business equiry .
But I respectfully insist you read crefully as I am optimistic it will open 
doors for unimaginable financial reward for both us.
This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of your 
business activities ,but I plead your assistance ,as your flair for 
profitable business is needed .
Permit me to introduce myself. I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of 
auditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of AFRICAN 
DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an abandoned sum of$ 10.5m 
US dollars . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who 
died along with his entire family in november 2002 in a plane crash.
Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased 
anindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately I learnt that all 
his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside
with him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.
It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don?t 
want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.
The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.
The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned bythe 
fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next 
of kin to a foreigner.
I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, 
inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me . There after 
I will visit your country with my family for disbursement according to the 
percentages indicated.
Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number,
your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication 
and location where in the money will be remitted .
On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or by 
email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide materials 
confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment formalities from the 
payment Agency. I willbe handling official

http://www.lloydstsb.com.hk
Thank you for giving me your time,it is of great importance for you to
take care and understand every word which I have written down below;
please be patient and read my email.
I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc here in Hong Kong attached in Private
Banking Services. I am contacting you concerning a customer and an
investment placed under our banks management; as a matter of fact it was 3
years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this
mail private and also to kindly respect the integrity of the information
you come by as a result of this email.I contacted you independently of our
investigation and no one is informed of this communication; I would like
to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to
In 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank to
engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services
Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37
million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over
(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made
numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief
operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially
given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on
numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and however I
encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The
favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on
600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternative
investments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various
opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of
operation, the accrued profit with interest included, stood at this point
at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full
potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on
investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the money be liquidated because he
needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He
directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in
Europe.I informed him that our bank would have to make special
arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process,
the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for
banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later
came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was
asking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict
since the incidents of 9/11.
I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainland
Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise
instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security
consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts
deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that
handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate
access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar
especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line
with instructions, the money was deposited; he told me he wanted the money
there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was
the last communication we had, this transpired around February 25th 2002.
In June last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us of
the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding
position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the
private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and
I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I
made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of
locating him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four
days later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently
dead, a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart
attack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather more
information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately
launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert
about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate. If you
are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our
services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from
conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In
the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will
know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors
use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives
the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the
bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I
said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart
from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in
our care, in this case; he died in testate.
In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed
away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who
should have right to claim the estate, this investigation for several
months were futile. We have scanned every continent and used our private
investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem. It is
this investigation that resulted in my decision to obtain your contact
details and contact you, being as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a
potential benefactor of the estate even if you are in no way affiliated
with this individual (the deceased).My official capacity dictates that I
am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to
receive the results of the investigation. What this means, with you being
a foreigner, I have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died
with no known or identifiable family member.
This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the
prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late
beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the
end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to
our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert
the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the money entering our
bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out
of the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have
my way.
What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I
want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking
world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational.
The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for
those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you
should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I
propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I alone have the deposit
details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them
to do so.I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the
finance firm is concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer
concluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions
in relation to the file are just customer services and due process. The
finance firm has no single idea of what's the history or nature of the
deposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to
any party that comes forward, and this is the situation.
This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of
the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family
but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal; I am
prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to
release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt
of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in half and no
more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them
release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the proceeds 50/50.I would
have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have
drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit,
but on the other hand, you as a indifferent foreigner would easily pass as
the beneficiary with the rights to claim, I assure you that I could have
the deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank
of the final closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then
officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to
release the deposit to you; with these two things: all is done. The
alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another
bank with you as account holder, this way there will be no need for you to
think of receiving the money from the firm.
We can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the
consequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest in
this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that you do
not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal to you,
delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please not destroy my
career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this
but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations
run the whole private banking sector, I am not a criminal and what I do, I
do not find against good conscience, this may be hard for you to
understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this
move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot
let this chance pass me by and I hope you understand, because for once I
found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny.
These chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my chance,
if you will not work with me please let me know, and hence move on with my
life, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and this is an occasion to
provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project
and it is a task well worth undertaking, I have evaluated the risks and
the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and
alerting my bank; I am the only one who knows of this situation, good
fortune will bless you and plant you into the center of relevance in my
life, let�s share the blessing.
If you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me
specifically, through this email account (wang6qin@yahoo.com.hk), if you
give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a
conclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition should
you contact me via official channels; I will simply deny knowing you and
about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through our
official lines neither do I want you contacting me through my official
email account. Contact me only through this email address above; I do not
want any direct link between you and me.My official lines are not secure
lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer
care in line with our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this
instruction religiously.
Please, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two kids, I
send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the
consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is
nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter
of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private banking
clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, I shall
have the pleasure of meeting you after this task has been completed plan a
meeting, soon.
I await your response.

Good day,
I am david scott, staff of International Private
Banking at Bristol & West Bank. I am contacting you
concerning a deceased customer and an investment he
placed under our banks management six years ago. I
would respectfully request that you keep the contents
of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of
the information you come by as a result of this mail.
I contacted you independently of our investigation and
no one is informed of this communication. I would like
to intimate you with certain facts that I believe
would be of interest to you. In 2000, the subject

at the London based security consultancy firm, Mayfair

Dear Friend,
Good day and Compliments.
I am writing this letter in confidence believing that if it is the wish of 
God for you to help me and my family,God almighty will bless and reward you 
aboundantly and you would never regreat this.
I am a female student from University of Burkina-Faso,Ouagadougou.I am 25 
yrs old.I'd like any person who can be caring,loving and home oriented.I 
will love to have a long-term relationship with you and to know more about 
you.I would like to build up a solid foundation with you in time coming if 
you can be able to help me in this transaction.
Well,my father died on 5th May 2005 and left I and my junior brother behind. 
He was a king, which our town citizens titled him over sixteen years before 
his death.
I was a princess to him and I am the only person who can take care of his 
wealth now because my junior brother is still young and my mother is not 
literate enough to know all my father's wealth. He left the sum of USD 
7,350, 000.00 dollars (seven Million, Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand US 
Dollars),in a security company.This money was annually paid into my late 
fathers account from Shell petroleum development company(SPDC)and chevron 
oil company operating in our locality for the compensation of youth and 
community development in our jurisdiction.
I don't know how and what I will do to invest this money somewhere in 
abroad,so that my father's kindred will not take over what belongs to my 
father and our family,which they were planning to do without my present 
because I am a female as stated  by our culture in the town.
Now,I urgently need your humble assistance to move this money from the 
security company to your bank account and I strongly believe that by the 
grace of God,you will help me invest this money wisely.
I am ready to pay 20% of the total amount to you if you help us in this 
transaction and another 10% interest of Annual After Income to you,for 
handling this transaction for us,which you will strongly have absolute 
control over.
If you can handle this project sincerely and also willing to assist me in 
lifting this fund,kindly reach me.You can reach me through this email 
id.(princess_silvee2006@yahoo.com).
Please, note that this transaction is 100% risk free and I hope to commence 
the transaction as quick as possible, I will send you my picture as soon as 
I hear from you.
Yours sincerely,
Princess  Silvee.

Dear Friend
My name is Mr. David Kofi, the regional manager of International commercial 
Bank (ICB) Kaneshie Branch Ghana.
I am a Ghanaian married with two kids.
I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us. As the 
regional manager of the bank, it’s my duty to send financial reports to my 
head office in the capital city of Accra.
On the course of the last year 2005 end of the of the year’s report, I 
discovered that my branch in which I am the manager made Six Million Five 
Hundred and Fifty Thousand US Dollars (6,550.000.00) of which my head Office 
is not aware of and will never be aware of. I have since then PLACED this 
fund on a SUSPENCE ACCOUNT without a beneficiary.
As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thus 
I am compelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into 
your bank account.
I intend to part with 30% of this fund to you while 70% shall be for me.
I do need to assure you that there is practically no risk involved in this. 
It’s going to be a bank-to-bank transfer.
All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund.
If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response.
With regards,
David Kofi

Dear Friend
Good day to you,
My name is Irvin Shawn I am an American soldier, serving in the military with the Third infantry Division in Iraq.

LIBERIAN
Dearest Beloved one,
Based on your profile, l am happy to request for your assistance and
also to go into business partnership with you, i believe that you will
not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you.
I am Mr Mcuty Udoa,19years old and the only Son of my late parents
MR.and MRS MUSTAPHA UDOA. My father was a highly reputable busnness
magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of LIBERIAN during
his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France
during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though
his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been
masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.
But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and
since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary
12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital
and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State
Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk
box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was
registered as family valuables personal for security reasons.
I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't
know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a
result of incessant political crisis here in LIBERIAN . The death of my
father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire
of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas
will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
1. Can I completely trust you?
2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you?
Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
Thank you so much.
My sincere regards,
Mr Macuty UdoFROM:MRS.GLORIA DUBE I NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE 
FROM:MRS.GLORIA DUBE.
Good  Day
I NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE
This may appear a bit surprising to you but very beneficial as a matter of
urgentcy,I am desparately looking for a foriegn partner whom i can trust
to handle
some investment or fund movement.I am Mrs.GLORIA DUBE,wife of late Mr.PETER
DUBE,who was murdered by the Zimbabwean veterans and irrate blackpeople.I am
writing from South Africa.I got your address from the internet through the
consultancy directory during my search for a reliable and honest person to
transact this business
with.
I write to solicit for your special assistance to a family shattered by a
tyrannical government led by a dictator and his(ZANU-PF)ruling
party-president
Robert Mugabe.Because of land and farm land crisis in Zimbabwe,the government
secretly sponsored the war veterans and some irrate party members to
disposess the
land being occupied by white farmers.This action has led to the killing of
some
members of opposition party including my husband(Mr.PETER DUBE).
But before the death of my husband,he anticipated some dangers and so he
deposited
the sum of US$15.4m(Fifteen million four hundered Thousand United States
Dollars)in the name of our only son JAMES DUBE,with the help of reputable
security
company in south Africa with the intention of using it to open fertilizer
manufacturing company among other companies in our neighbouring
country(Swaziland)after his university education.
On the 29th of June 2000,the war veterans and some supporters
of(ZANU-PF)ruling
party trooped into our compound and axed him(my husband)to death.Since
then,they
have been terrorizing my only son,JAMES DUBE,but we managed to escape to a
neighbouring country,South Africa as a political asylum
seeker(refugee).But our
position in South Africa does not permit us to open an account or run any
huge
financial business.
That is why I want this fund to be transferred into your private account
so that
you will assist him to invest it in your country.Hence,if you agree to assist
us,we will offer you 20% of the money for your assistance,80% will be for our
family investment in your country through your assistance.I need your
urgent and
confidential response.Please you can contact my son JAMES DUBE Email him
atjamesdube000@webmail.co.za
Best regards,
Mrs.GLORIA DUBE.
(For The Family).
Upon your immediate response,I will immediately arrange and send to you
all the
informations that will empower your good self in finalizing the
transaction with
the security company here in south Africa I will also send to you the
agreement
that will protect both interest.And also further information about
yourself is
necessary for I can not play on this.
Waiting for your prompt and positive response.Please read about problems in
Zimbabwe from the link below.

PLEASE CONTACT MY SON JAMES DUBE HE IS THE ONE IN CHARGE OF THE MONEYRE:INVESTMENT!!
Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met, permit me however, I am Mr. Alan Jack a Zimbabwean Farmer.
I am contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country (Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not guaranteed, just as reported by the International media.
This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more than 6000 white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 white farmers were killed; the government didn't stop at this, as just recently the government has asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives.
Therefore, I decided to contact you through my local Zimbabwean associate (Mr. Dennis Udongo) for your assistance so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your country. For this purpose, I have deposited in a Security Company based in Amsterdam (Holland) all the funds realized from the sales of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to USD18, 500,000.00 (Eighteen million, five hundred United States Dollars). These funds was packaged in two metal boxes and declared as personal effects and photographic materials so as to avoid detection by immigration/security officials. For now, I stay in Asia, because Zimbabwe is highly unsafe for me and my family. Upon your immediate response, I will immediately arrange and send to you all the documentation that will empower your good self in finalizing the transaction with the Security Company in UAE Dubai.
Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free and genuine and should also be handled in the most confidential manner. This proposal is NOT and must NOT be linked to all the numerous SCAM letters flying around the internet world today. The money (USD18.5m) already stashed in the two boxes could be termed as consignment and I will not hesitate to link you to my safe contact in the security company for further discussion. Lest I forget, you should be entitled to 30% of the total funds for your support and cooperation in the transaction. It’s also your duty to assist me in investing my own share of the money in your company or in your country. I shall be counting on your unalloyed trust and immediate response.
Best Regards and God bless.

My name is Mr. Melvin Samson I work as an accountant in a bank; I contacted 
you to work together with me in claiming my late client's estate.

you share the same last name with him.
This has officially transferred the right to you, as no other person from 
his family knows anything about this fund with our bank.If you are 
interested in working with me,
please get back to me as quickly as possible so that I give you the details 
of what we are to  do. I wait for your prompt response so that I can give 
you more briefing of what you need to and how to do it.
Thanks for your co-operation.

"Dear Friend,
I am Mrs.Lisa Williams from Malaysia.I am married to Dr.Williams Suzuki who worked with Satndard Bank in London for nine years before he died in the year 2003.We were married for nine years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.After his death in 2003, there was confusion in the entire family as regards sharing of the family assets and more also, there is envy and 
jealousy as it was obvious that I was my husband's favourite wife because my 
husband had three wife which i am the youngest and my husband was a 
muslim when he was alive.As soon as he passed away, coupled with the fact 
that, what i have and what is due to me might be taking away from me by greedy family relations whose reasons is based on family tradition and ethics i therefore decided to carefully moved out the fund which my husband deposited from the bank where it was originally deposited with the help of British diplomats and deposite it with a private organization abroad.The amount of the fund is 18 million dollars.
Presently,this money is still with the the organization. I'm asking your 
partnership to transfer the fund to your account.I took this decision because I 
don't have any child and my husband relatives are not in good terms 
with me.I don't want them to know about this development. With God all 
things are possible.I am prepared to compensate you with 20%.And i have 
also set aside 10% for any expenses that may incure in this transaction 
for both parties.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the

Attn:The President
Dear Sir,
I write to solicite your assistance and support to enable me execute a  very 
lucrative and high profiting business transaction.I am very  sure that with 
trust and understanding,we will be able to execute this busines to our 
mutual benefit and believe that you will not let down the  trust I am 
willing to repose in you.
I work for an Ivorien based import and export firm ("a-MIC"), I work product 
sourcing manager. Between the 17th -19th of may, 2002 a  business seminar 
was held in BOUAKE Cote Divoire  of which I attended.While in the Seminar, I 
was opportuned to meet ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD ,the President of 
ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & CATTLE FARMS ETS. ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD isan 
accomplished and widely known and recognised millionaire farmer in this part 
of the region. He has cattle farms in different  countries. Above all, he is 
one of the greatest supplier  of cattle,beef and other diary products in 
this part of the coast.On getting to know my proffesion, ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI 
MAHMOUD took me into confidence by informing me about the purchase of a 
particular but very  important medicine for his cattle. He informed me that 
he buys this  product at $5,000.00 USD per carton, and that he mostly buys 
to the excess  of 450 cartons. He informed me that he would like me to find 
out if my organisation could source for him a cheaper supplier considering 
the  recent trend of falls in the general price of beef in the world market  
which is affecting his business.
Back in my office, I discussed this proposal with my boss and he  decided to 
handle the  supply by himself.We carried out a market research and  
discovered that we could purchase this medicine somewhere cheaper in EUROPE 
for $2,000.00 USD per carton . We moved a proposal to ALI-MAHMOUD DAIRY & 
CATTLE FARMS ETS. to make the supply to them at $4,800.00 USD per carton of 
which  he accepted. Owing to my role in the transaction, I had an agreement 
with my  director to be receiving 15% of whatever gain is made on each 
supply of which he agreed. But on the completion of the suply and the 
receipt of the payment, my boss renegated on our agreement and refused to 
give me my  share of the profit. Since then our relationship has been at its 
lowest  ebb. I have since accepted it as one of life experiences.
However, as God would have it, recently, I ran into ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI 
MAHMOUD and he informed me that he would want us to urgently supply him  
with 1250 cartons of the same product before the end of Dec 2006.I  used the 
oppurtunity to inform Alhaji that I can  introduce him to the main producer 
of this vaccine who can supply him  the product at $4,400.00 USD if he will 
pay in advance as he usually  does. He was very pleased and has assured me 
that he is not going to contact my boss again for this vaccine. He is  now 
waiting for me to link him to the producer of
the vaccine. We will buy the medicine at $2,000.00 USD from EUROPE and sell 
at  $4,400.00 USD TO ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD,with him making a down 
payment of  50% of our quoted price first.
If you are interested and capable of handling this supplies on my 
behalf,kindly get back to me urgently through my e-mail,so that we can agree 
on the terms and profit sharing,after which I can then furnish you with the 
contacts of both our source in EUROPE and that of ALHAJI NURUDEEN ALI 
MAHMOUD . Kindly be notified that at no point in time should you let  ALHAJI 
NURUDEEN ALI MAHMOUD know that you are not the producer of the medicine and 
we  should never allow him to know the
contact of our real source in EUROPE  so that he would'nt bypass us to deal 
directly with them.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Yours sincerely,
MR KONAN ALAIN

http://messenger.msn.click-url.com/go/onm00200471ave/direct/01/Re: Inquiry From Kevin
Good day,
I am Mr. Kevin Garforth,staff of Cater Allen Private Bank. I am contacting
you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our
banks management three years ago.I Would respectfully request that you
keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of
the information you come by as a result of this mail.I am contacting you
independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this
communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I
believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2002, the subject matter;
came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private
banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of Six
Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us turn over
(invest) on his behalf.
I was the officer assigned to his case, I made numerous suggestions in
line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the
private banking sector then, especially given the volume of funds he
wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any
investments being placed.I encouraged him to consider various growth funds
with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to
start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and
2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the
money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our
first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this
point at over Two million United States Dollars, this margin was not the
full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on
investments.
In mid 2003, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to
make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He
directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I
informed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have
this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have
to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and
statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around
when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.
Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the
incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available
to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I
followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds
deposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist
private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and
blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake
transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly
private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and
well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was
deposited with the security firm.
The deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his
arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we
had, this transpired around 25th of November 2003.In June last year, we
got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of
that particular portfolio.This was an astounding position as far as I was
concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was
the only one who knew about the deposit at the security firm, and I could
not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his deposit.
I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.
I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal
investigations department of Cater Allen.Four days later, information
started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited
his description was declared dead of a heart attack in canne, in Southern
part of France.We were soon enough to identify the body and cause of death
was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into
possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to
come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking
affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but
also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his
bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking,
opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence,
accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to
make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors
of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring
that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they
nominate next of kin.
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also
usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased
died without a testate. In line with our internal processes for account
holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in
good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This
investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned
every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to
get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in
my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the
deceased.
My present official capacity as the Head of Finance dictates that I am the
only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive
the results of the investigation. What this means,is that our dear late
fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as
the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is
in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.
According to practice, The Security Firm will by the end of this financial
year broadcast a request for statements of claim to Cater Allen, failing
to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back
to Cater Allen.This will result in the money entering the Cater Allen
accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the
private banking division.
This will not happen if I have my way. What I wish to relate to you will
smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is
only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of
the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is
fraught with huge rewards for those that occupy certain offices and
oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together
the general direction of what I propose. There is Six Million dollars
deposited in a security firm, I alone have the deposit details and they
will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I
alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as my Bank  is
concerned.
The transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to
the security firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file
are just customer services and due process. The security Firm has no
single idea of what�s the history or nature of the deposit. They are
simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that come
forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money
trying to track this man�s family; they have investigated for months and
have found no family. The investigation has come to an end.
My proposal:I now seek your permission to present you  as a next of kin to
the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you
the beneficiary to the funds $6,000 000 00 (Six Million United states
Dollar) ; I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The
security Firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving
relation. Upon receipt of the deposit,I am prepared to share the money
with you. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have
them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 60/40.I would have
gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would have
drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit.I
assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few
days.
I will simply inform Cater Allen of the final closing of the file
relating to the deceased. I will then officially communicate with The
Security Firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these
two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have The
Security Firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account
holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the
money from The Security Company. We can fine-tune this based on our
interactions am aware of the consequences of this proposal.I ask that if
you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I
ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no
appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.
Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You
may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of
comparable situations run the whole private banking sector.I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good  conscience, this may
be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates
that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a
lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in
total control of my destiny.
These chances won�t pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance,
if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life
but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to
provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project
and it is a task well worth undertaking.I have evaluated the risks and the
only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my
bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has
blessed you with a luck that has planted you into the center of relevance
in my life. Let�s share the blessing. If you find yourself able to work
with me, contact me through this email account. If you give me positive
signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion.
I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I
will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you
contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting
me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers
I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want
any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are not secured
lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer
care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.Please observe this
instruction religiously.
Please, again, note that I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I
send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the
consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained
and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This
is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not
betray my confidence.

Dear ,
I am Mark Nguessane from Seirra-Leone I am the son of Chief Nguessane Bakari 
who was the managing director and owner of NGEBAK Import/Export

dollars) in a bank here in abidjan on behalf of his foreign business partner 
in abroad and he advised me to look for a co-beneficiary from abroad to 
transfer these money to his account for investment in his country.
Presently,the members of his extended family has claimed all his companies 
leaving nothing behind for us,his extended family members also sent us away 
from his house where we are living and they seized all our house hold 
properties.
We are presently now staying in a hotel here in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire 
because of our lives and the security of the valid documents which the bank 
gave to our late father on the day he made the deposit lest the members of 
our late fathers extended family will kill us and Claim these money in the 
bank.
Based on our ignorance in the international business world of this sort,we

money, for the bank to transfer these money to your safe and secured bank 
account in your country.

I am contacting you because of a business concerning a huge sum of money 
which was deposited by a client in the Security and Finance company where I 
work here in Nigeria.Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will 
make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will 
be well at the end of the day. I actually decided to contact you due to the 
urgency of this transaction.
PROPOSITION;
I discovered an abandoned deposit in my company owned by one of our
foreign customers who died along with his entire family as a result of
an automobile crash. He actually deposited this funds amounting to
US$40,000,000.00 (fourty million united states dollars), for safe
keeping in my company here in Nigeria. Company file records shows that the 
funds was actually for a project. Our late costurmer wanted to start a multi 
million Dollar steel plant in Florida, USA in the near futur,before his 
sudden and untimely death. As such since his death none ofhis relations or 
next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this property as the heir, 
this basically the reason why I have
contacted you. My company cannot release the property unless someone
applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our 
operating guidelines.
Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a
next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully
worked out by me for the funds to be released in your favour as the
beneficiary's next of kin. It may interest you to know that I have
secured from the probate an order to locate any of deceased
beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance
of our mutual business endeavour by furnishing me with the following;
1. Beneficiary full name and address
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers
3. Occupation and position
4. Nationality and Date of birth
5. Marital status
6. Gender/sex
These requirements will enable me file letter of claim to the
appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before
you can personally appear for the claim. I shall be compensating you
with 30% of the total money while 10% will be for any expenses incurred and 
the rest will be mine on final conclusion of this project. Please note that 
your share stays while the rest shall be for me for investment purposes.
If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of
the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your urgent reply through my

PLEASE MAIL BACK
My Dearest ONE
May the peace of gracious God be with you,please I have a problem which I 
needed a help from you,I have decided to write you for help.
I have a proposal for you-this however is not mandatory nor will I in any 
manner compel you to honour against your will.
I am in a state of delinma and made up my mind to send you this mail , I am 
ROSLINE MATHEW ,21 years old and the only daughter of my late parents Mr. 
and Mrs. MATHEW NZOBEl.
My father was a highly reputable business magnet (a cocoa merchant) who 
operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days.
It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of 
his bus iness trips abroad on 12th.Febuary 2004.
Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been 
masterminded by an
uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.
But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and 
since then my father took me so special.
Before his death on February 12 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied 
him to the hospital and told him that he has the sum of eight million, seven 
hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$8.700,000) left in one of the 
leading security company.
He further told him that he depaosited the money in my name, and finally 
issued a written instruction to his lawyer whom he said is in possession of 
all the necessary legal documents to this fund and the security company .
I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know 
what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result o 
f incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast. The death of my father 
actually brought sorrow to my life. I am in a sincere desire of your humble 
assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly 
regarded.
Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter?
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you 
after the money is in your account?
Please, Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
Thank you so much.Mey God bless you and your family.
My sincere regards,
ROSLIN MATHEW

Dear friend,
I am a staff of Private Banking Services at the Bank of China (BOC). I am
contacting you concerning our customer and, an investment placed under our
banks management 3 years ago.
I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail
confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a
result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation
and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you
with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to
In 2002, the subject matter; ref: bb/boc/bank/0012 came to our bank to
engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services
Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.35
million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over
(invest) on his behalf.
I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in
line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the
Private Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of funds
he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any
investments being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth
funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is
to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers
and 2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun
the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our
first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this
point at over 10 million United States Dollars,
this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk
guaranteed returns on investments.
In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to
make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed
that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm. I informed
him that the bank would have to make special arrangements to have this
done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to
make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory
charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I
explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash
movement across borders has become especially strict since the incident
of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate in and had the funds available.
I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise
instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security
consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts
deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that
handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate
access to cash. This small and highly private organization is familiar
especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line
with instructions, the money was deposited. He told me he wanted the
money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week.
This was the last communication we had, this transpired around 9th
October 2004.
In January this year, we got a call from the security firm informing us
that the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding
position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the
private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit , and
I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his
deposit. I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task
of locating him to the internal investigations department of the bank of
china. Four days later, information started to trickle in, apparently he
was dead. A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart
attack in Canne, South of France. We were soon enough able to identify the
body and cause of death was confirmed.
The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving
next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim
his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who
patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of
detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no
next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us
means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a
name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.
This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to
them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the
account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private
banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most
cases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died intestate.
In line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed
away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who
should have right to claim the estate. This investigation has for the past
months been unfruitful. We have scanned every continent and used our
private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the
problem. The investigation did not ever yield any result My official
capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation
and the only party to receive the results of the investigation.
This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the
prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late
beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by the
end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to
BOC, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the
deposit back to BOC. This will result in the money entering the BOC
accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of
the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have
my way.
What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want
you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world
who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The
world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those
who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have
begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.
There is US$ 8,370,000.00 deposited, I alone have the deposit details and
they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I
alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as BOC is
concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I
sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to
the file are just customer services and due process.
They are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party
that comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great
amounts of money trying to track this man's family; they have investigated
for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end.
My proposal;  I am prepared to place you in a position to give instruction
for the release of the  deposit to you as the closest surviving relation.
Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in
half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the
next of kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the
proceeds 50/50.
I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would
have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the
deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within
a few days. I will simply inform the bank of
the final closing of the file relating to the customer I will then
officially communicate with the  firm  and instruct them to release the
deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would
be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another
bank with you as account holder. This way there will be no need for you to
think of receiving the money from the firm.  We can fine-tune this based
on our interactions.
I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no
interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you
do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you,
delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my
career because you do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this
but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of
comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be

process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact

I am Dr. Peter Gungula the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting 
section Union Togolaise De Banque lome-togo and also Chairman of 
Investigating and Auditing Department of this Bank. With due respect and 
regard, I have decided to contact you on a Business Transaction that will be 
very beneficial to both of us and our families at the end of this 
transaction.
During our Investigation and Auditing in this Bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to one Deceased who died on 
October 24, 2004 Martinsville plane crash Aircraft type Beechcraft King Air 
As the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim 
of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation because he did 
not indicate any next of kin to this account.
The amount in the dormant account is Fourteen Million United States Dollars 
As it may interest you to know, I got your contact from the Chamber of 
Commerce on foreign business relations here in Lome -togo though I did not 
disclose why i needed a foreign contact and only told the director on seat 
it was for retirement and investment purposes.
Meanwhile as a Senior Staff in this bank, and the Director of Auditing and 
Accounting, I have in my possession all the necessary documents to perfect 
this deal by making you the bonafide next of kin/Partner whom this money 
will be transferred into your account.
I need your assistance and co-operation to get this deal done. Because as a 
foreigner, you stand a better position to be presented through documentation 
as the next of kin/Partner since the deceased is also a foreigner, this is 
the reason why I could not do this deal alone as a staff of the bank as 
well.
I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On 
smooth Conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone 
bills, while 60% will be for me and my partner. Please, you have been 
advised to keep this "Top Secret" as we are still in service and intend to 
retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.
I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm 
the money in your bank account. And ask me to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further investment,either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in.
All other necessary vital information will be sent to you when I hear from 
you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in 
this deal.
I am expecting your urgent reply as soon as you receive this message.
God bless you And your family.

Dear Friend,
I am Mrs.Suha Arafat Yasser from Palestinian. I am married to the late formal head of state of Palestinian for several years before he died in France after a brief illness. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only few days. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $18m (eighteen million U.S.Dollars)with a BANK in London. Presently, I have carefully moved this funds out of the bank in London and deposit it with a private company in Europe as a photo material for family use for safe keeping so that my govern we not know about this funds as they have already seized and freeze all the bank account belonging to my late husband both home and abroad. In fact the total sum allegedly discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of about $6.5 Billion Dollars. And they are not relenting on their effort to make me poor for life. As you know, the Moslem community has no regards for woman, hence my desire for a foreign assistance. You can visit the BBC news b
roadcast below for better understanding of what I am talking about.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3995769.stm
It is on this note that I'm asking your partnership to keep this fund to your account. I took this decision because my government is not in good terms with me; I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of the presence of my government agents around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of my lawyer who is base in London Uk to finalize this transaction with you.  
Best Regards, 
Mrs. Suha Arafat Yasser

to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer this money to a 
foreign account has been put in Place and directives and needed information 
will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness 
to assist me and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity, 
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this 
country as a civil servant and we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would eventually raise eye brow on my side during the time of 
transfer because I work in this bank.
This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who 
will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to 
the bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to 
be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification 
and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole 
money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.
I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free, on 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer, while 65% will be for 
me, please you have been advised to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in 
service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with 
I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank Until you confirm 
the money in your account, and ask us to come down to your country for 
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated 
and further Investment, either in your country or any country you advice us 
to invest in and all other necessary vital information will be send to you 
when I hear from you.
I suggest you get back to me As soon as possible and also include your 
personal phone/mobile and fax numbers for easy communication.
Yours faithfully,
Mr. Usman Sankara

Dear friend.
Good Day,
I am Mr NIABBA IBRAHIM, Senior Credit Officer of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 
ANNEX BURKINA FASO.Here is a 100% concealed and  mutually profitable 
business proposal for you. After the United States  and Iraqi war, our 
client Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in 
Iraq and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 12 calendar 
months, with a value of ten million five hundred thausand usd only in my 
branch.Upon maturity several notices were sent to him, even in the first 
quater of this year.Again another notification was sent and still no 
response came from him. We later found out that the Deputy Governor has been 
assasinated in Baghdad.
The websites below is a proof  and verification of the news about his  
death:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/middle_east/3970619.stm
http://www.uslaboragainstwar.org/article.php?id=6979
After further investigation it was also discovered that Hatem Kamil Abdul 
Fatah did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the 
paper  work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he 
was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, 
ten million five hundred usd$ is still lying in my bank and no one will ever 
come forward to claim it. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is 
that I will like you as a neutral person to stand in as the next of kin to 
Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah so that you will be able to receive his funds with 
my aid as the insider. THE PREREQUISITE OF THIS PROJECT:I want you to know 
that I have had everything planned out so that we come out successful.all 
that is required from you NOW is  for you to provide me with your Full Names 
and Address so that i can prepare the documents with your name. After you 
have been made the next of kin,you will also file in for claims on your and 
secure the necessary approvals and letter of probate to enable the bank move 
the funds to an account that will be provided by you.
There are no risks involved in the matter as we are going to adopt a  
legalized method and all necessary documents will be prepared by the bank 
for easy movement iof the fund into your account.Please endeavour to observe 
utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue.Once the funds have 
been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio 
of 60% for me, 30% for you and 10% for any expenses incurred during the 
course of this peration.Should you be interested, please send me your full 
particulars including your private phone and/or fax numbers for easy 
communication,and i will provide you with more details of this operation as 
well as my particulars.
I wait your respond
