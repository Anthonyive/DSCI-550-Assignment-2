OSLOâ€”Two weeks after he was arrested for the murder of a Norwegian churchgoer, the prime minister, Joko Widodo, said he would not seek re-election as his party's president next year, a move that may prove to be politically and religiously un-American.

The prime minister's move underscored the need for political reform in a country where the majority of the population is Christian and where, under the current political system, the church remains the sole source of political support.

"I will not seek re-election as president because the country is still in the crisis of the last 20 years and the policies of the current government are not applying in the way that I believe it is going to be," said the prime minister, who said his party would not accept any political or religious involvement in politics.

"I will not seek re-election because the country is still in the crisis of the last 20 years," he said. "We need a political reform that will ensure that the church remains the sole source of political and economic support in our country."
Mr. Widodo said he would not seek re-election because of the country's political situation as a whole, which is highly unstable and has lasted for four years.
"All people are entitled to their political and moral rights. I will not seek re-election because of the country's political situation as a whole as I have not seen any country where the Christian church remains the sole source of political support and financial support in our country," he said.
Mr. Widodo said he had made no secret of his political views and he did not want to overstate the fact that he still believes in a Europe-wide Christian nation-state.
"I will not seek re-election because of the country having no constitution or legal system to guide it. I will not seek political reform because of the pending war with the rebels in my country," he said.
Mr. Widodo said he will not seek re-election because the country is still in the war against the rebels because the government has not given the rebels a political mandate to take over the country.

Mr. Widodo said he will not seek re-election because of the country's politics and his family, including his late wife, died because of a heart attack.
