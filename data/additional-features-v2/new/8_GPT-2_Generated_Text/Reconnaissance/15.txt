The Democratic National Committee (DNC) has assembled a coalition of wealthy and Democratic Party members to fight for re-election in the upcoming November elections.
The organization has decided to seek investment from the state of West Africa to treat the issue as a foreign-sponsored problem, which is contained within the economic and security policies of the West. We have also decided to look for ways to develop the potential of financial assistance to assist us in our campaign.
In your assistance, we have considered the following:
(1) A low-cost direct deposit to be used as collateral or basis for any investment in this financial security.
(2) A foreign-owned company to allow us to use the funds for development of the South African National Petroleum Corporation (ANPC) that is currently owned and controlled by the United States Government.
(3) The country's monetary authority.
(4) A foreign entity to assist our revenue and expenses.
(5) A company to invest in South Africa that we believe will enable us to finance our development in a way which will enable us to increase our share of the total total money outstanding and thereby increase our share of the total funds outstanding in the South African National Petroleum Corporation.
Please be patient as we are trying to complete this project. We need your help to develop our investment.
Sincerely,
The Democratic National Committee (DNC)
