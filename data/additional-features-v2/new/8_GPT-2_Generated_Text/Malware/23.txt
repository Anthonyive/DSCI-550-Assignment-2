"I'm a family man. My wife works for the hospital and I have an associate of mine who is a bus driver in other field who has a full-time job and a part-time job. My daughter is an accountant who is working in another field. I get asked by the hospital to come to my hospital for a visit and the hospital asks for a sum of 1.5 million US dollars for the visit and this is a total of US$5.5.5 million. In the hospital, I am accompanied by my husband who is the head of the department. The hospital has conducted a investigation into these allegations and have decided to release the funds to the family. The hospital had issued me with the names of the accused as they are in custody but I am not a suspect. I do not know what kind of allegations they are making. This is because the hospital has decided to release the funds to the family and the hospital has told me that the investigation will not be done and that I will not be able to work with them. They have told me that I shall not be cleared out of the hospital as I am not a suspected person. I want my mother to know that this is a private investigation and that this will not be a part of the hospital. I am very sad as these allegations are not against me. I am not interested in a political or political party. I would rather be in a position where I am not associated with any political party. I am very sad. I have a lot of problems and I cannot handle them all. I have no choice but to accept this position. I am here to help the hospital make sure that they do not betray or betray me. I am here to assist them and help out in the investigation. The hospital has told me that they are not interested in any political party and that they are not interested in any political party because these allegations are not against me but they are against my family. I am very sad because these allegations are not against me. I am seeking the assistance of a lawyer to help me. I am interested in recovery of my father who was killed by a gun-battle in the Ninety-Ninth Regiment of the US Army in Iraq. He was an officer who was assigned to the division and was killed during his mission to liberate Kuwait in the late nineteen-eighties. As soon as he died, he was seized by the security forces and executed. I am the only surviving son of my late father, my late mother and my late father's wife. I have had family members who died in the field and this was due to the fact that their husbands were in the field when he was killed. I have had relatives who died during the fight and the deceased was seized by the security forces and executed. I am also seeking the support of a lawyer to help me.
