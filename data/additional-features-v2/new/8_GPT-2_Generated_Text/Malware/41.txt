I am a former hospital staff member in a hospital in the Eastern European country of the Republic of Croatia. My daughter, my wife and I have two late children. My husband and I travelled to the United States in 2002 to visit his family. My husband and I were married for four years before he died of a heart attack in a hospital in the Republic of Croatia in 2004. I met my husband on a private business trip to the United States where he met his late wife. I was looking forward to having a family to share many things with. For the last four years, I have been focusing on my work in my country to get a better understanding of the world around me. What is your project? What will you do to this? I have a few ideas that I would like to share with you. I want to work in a hospital to provide the care and security, as well as providing safe and clean living conditions for the patients, as a family. I have also tried to get my husband to the United States to travel to the United States to get a better understanding of the situation. My husband and I came to the United States from the West African country of the Republic of Congo where he was a hospital staff member in a hospital in the Eastern European country of the Republic of Croatia. My husband travelled to the United States with us to visit his family, but he died from a heart attack in a hospital in the Republic of Croatia in 2004. I had a hard time with the fact that I am a highly regarded individual and I have been waiting for my husband's death for more than a year, but finally came to the conclusion that he died of a heart attack in a hospital in the Eastern European country of the Republic of Croatia. I have decided to seek a new and better position to be a hospital staff member in the United States while to meet him in the United States as a family, as I believe this will be possible given the positive attitude and communication between the two of us. I would like to be the next to know of the death of my husband, as my husband died in a hospital in the Eastern Europe country of the Republic of Croatia after a tragic accident. My husband and I have travelled to the United States to help the parents and children of the deceased, as well as the care and security for them. I hope to assist them in a similar manner as the one who died in the hospital in the Eastern Europe country of the Republic of Croatia. I am interested in the desire of the family to communicate with one another through the Internet. I am interested in your suggestions to help me to get the proper communication and security as well as the knowledge to help the family. I am currently seeking your assistance to help me to ensure that all the information regarding my husband's death is available for people to contact and seek assistance. I want to have my husband's body examined and do a thorough investigation to locate the body, as this would be the only way to find out what the cause of death was. For the purpose of this proposal, I have used my best efforts. I have made my proposal to you to use your best efforts to arrange for my husband's body to be found and brought back to the United States for burial, as I am very interested in your help in this direction. I seek your assistance to assist me to establish an official base for my husband's body to be found as soon as possible. I have also made a proposal to the United States government as a safe haven for my husband's body to be located in a safe location for burial. I am seeking your help to lodge a proposal with the United States government for the burial of my husband's body to be released from the United States for burial. This proposal has been successful and I am in the process of giving this proposal the highest level of respect for my husband's life. My proposal is to be accompanied by my husband's family and closest relatives as well as anyone who knows me personally. I have planned to communicate with my husband through the Internet as soon as possible, I am not interested in any charges or charges to be paid for your assistance. I have also planned to send you emails with your proposal when possible and the response will be sent to you immediately. I have also set up a task to transfer the proposal to the United States. If you would like to be the next to know about this proposal and the execution of the transaction, please contact me through my personal e-mail address: stela.grashen@gmail.com.au.
I pray that God will bless you with the blessing of your death. 
I would like to ask that you please be patient with me as I know that if you do not respond to my email or email me, you will not be able to contact me and I will simply send you the reply you requested.
Please understand,
