My next of kin is a US citizen who is married to one of the Bank's designated foreign account holders.I discovered the money in his account before my arrival here,his wife died in a car accident some time before my arrival here. He is a highly regarded bank security officer. He has been in service at various levels of the bank.
The bank has had a lot of trouble in the past which has resulted in the death of my husband and the death of my wife.
This money is in a foreign bank account that I got from a risk taker who was the head of my security department.
I have been informed that a foreign bank has been established to handle the money for us. All the details we need to complete the necessary paperwork for the transfer are in its possession. I am asking that you not to contact the bank to which this money belongs and only go for what you are going to do.
