It's been a very busy week for me, but I got your email this morning to contact you - as I am not quite sure what to do. And I am going to share with you a list of things that I need to do for you. I need your honest assistance in making this happen, and I want you to be the one to listen to this message. PLEASE, DONT HELP ME!!!
