I am Dr. B.R.K. Sulti.I am the Chief of Department for the Department of Finance. I have made arrangements with you to invest in your country, I have paid off the balance of my last account in your country with one of the foreign banks which I have met with no success. We need to get this money out of your account, I have been appointed by you to do this job. I have been waiting for you to contact me in order to finalize this deal.

I received this email from a foreigner in the Republic of the Philippines. I have been living here since I was a child. I have been told that my money will be used for the disbursement of your money for the security of the investment. I have been provided with the funds by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Philippines.
Recently, we discovered that your bank account is at risk of being seized by the Government of the Republic of the Philippines. Through the efforts of our colleagues here in the Philippines, we are able to get this money out of your account in your country. We are in a position to use this money for the purpose of foreign exchange purposes, however, we cannot use this money for anything less than the transfer of this money to a foreign account.
The Government of the Republic of the Philippines has been trying to put this money into the country so more and more people will come to the United States and all these people will be notified to our bank. These people are the only citizens of this country who can legally claim this money for themselves. We are going to relocate the funds to your account in your country in order to use for foreign exchange purposes.
This is not a money transfer, this money is sent to you through your account. This is because you cannot transfer funds through the account without the consent of the bank's director. This is why I decided to go ahead and transfer this money into your account, I have all important paperwork in order for this to happen.

Your accountant is my best choice as he handles all the paperwork for you. I have to ensure that the money is safe and kept in a safe and secure place. I am going to instruct your accountant to transfer the money into your account and the balance to your account in your own country. This is the only way you can claim the funds while remaining safe and secured.
All we need to do is to send you the following information for your assistance.
your safe and confidential details.
your phone and fax number and all other information you need to claim this money from your bank account.
your bank account phone address, fax and real-time address.
your full name and telephone and fax numbers.
your bank account and bank account numbers.
your account number and your telephone and fax numbers.
for all other necessary details.
