I got my phone call from an American who was in a very good position to assist me in the investigation. My question is, when will the assistance be given to you?
I am a foreigner and am not sure what to do now. I am going to have a business meeting in Europe next week before my stay in this country, which should be very profitable for us. I want to hear from you before you send me any money or any information concerning the matter. I do not want any risk but we are going to be very careful in this regard.
My wife and I are not big business type people and we have no other choice but to give up the business we have to live in this country, as we got into trouble owing to the fact that we are foreign citizens.
I am a foreigner and my wife is also a foreigner. We are in a very difficult situation. I am in a very low paid position as a law firm and the position I am in is very low. I need your help in this regard.
Please reply to this email/phone/fax to tell me that you are ready to assist us and I will give you a very good reply, as I am the only foreigner in the room that is affected by the transfer. I am very grateful for your help.
I want to assure you that I am very confident that you will do your utmost to take care of this matter as soon as possible. I am very sure that you will not disappoint with your efforts and will be very easy to work with.
Best Regards
Mr.Robert K.M.

It is well known that the British Government secretly took away my passport. Though I am not a foreigner, I have just discovered that my foreign passport was some fifty million dollars.
The reason I discovered this money is that I was abducted as a child by a foreign man.
My parents died when I was 2 years old. My father was a member of the British Secret Service and the whole thing lasted for over a year.
Now I am back in my country with my father who is a member of the British Secret Service. I am in a deep need of money for my business. I have met with some foreign officials and it is very alluring for me, since I have been seeking for a foreigner to help me in my business dealings. The officials from the American Embassy and the American Embassy in Malaya had told me about this money and I had not been able to get it because my passport is now in the British Government Bank account. They claim that I am not a foreigner, but I am a foreigner and I am very grateful for your assistance.
I have also been contacted by the American Embassy in Malaya who have sent me a statement that they are back in the whole matter and they have said that they will not let me go because I am a foreigner and they want to send me money to help me in my business.
I have also been contacted by the American Embassy while I was in the custody of the United States Government in various foreign countries. I will now seek your assistance to get this money out of the British Government Bank account of my father.
I have been told by the American officials that the money is for a foreign account and they will not let any foreigner in unless they can show that they are capable of taking the money out of the bank account of his father.
