JEFFERSON J. KUSHNER
MOMENT OF SATURDAY, MAY 5TH 2002.
I am Mr.Jefferson KUSHNER, a student of the United States National Security Council. Since the end of the Korean War, I have been the subject of numerous confidential documents being handed over to the United States government for payment.
When I was a senior officer in the United States Air Force during World War II, I had the courage to disclose the details of the injuries inflicted on my colleagues by the American and British forces during a total surprise attack on the regime of Kim Il Sung, the country's first prime minister.
It is said that the only thing that kept the world from believing that my colleagues were executed is my honest and honest belief that my colleagues would be executed. But the truth has never been known like it is on the face of it.
I believe that we must continue to deal with these kinds of situations in our daily lives. I have been informed that the American and British governments have a secret plan to use these documents to make an international banking transaction to make a profit, and that the board of directors of the Bank of the Republic of Korea have decided to use them for a foreign transaction.
I have decided to use these documents to make the transaction through the banking company of the Bank of the Republic of Korea (BOCK) capable of transferring funds to the Bank of Korea.
The Bank of the Republic of Korea (BOCK) is a central bank with its headquarters in Pyongyang, North Korea, which has been under the control of the United States since the end of World War II. It is a part of a consortium of banks, investment banks, and foreign banks that are under investigation for the execution of foreign branches of foreign banks.
The Bank of the Republic of Korea (BOCK), having concluded its investigation, has decided to use these documents to transfer the funds to another foreign bank.
It is because of this conviction that I decided to use these documents to make this transaction through the banking company of the Bank of the Republic of Korea (BOCK) capable of transferring funds to the Bank of the Republic of Korea (BOCK) for the transfer of the funds to foreign accounts.
The bank has decided to use these documents to transfer the funds from my company, Mylden Bank, to another bank in the United States.
The bank has also decided to use these documents to transfer the funds from my company, Mylden Bank, to another bank in the United States where we will have the right to receive the funds from.
I have decided that I will be the only one who will give the bank the funds to transfer to other accounts.
I have decided to retire from this business in my role as a consultant to the official account holder of the bank in the United States.
The bank has declared that the fund will be for payment of the expenses incurred by me and my colleagues during the bank's investigation into the death of my colleagues, who were murdered by the British during the Korean War.
I intend to transfer the sum of $5 million,000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.000.00.000.000.00.000.000.00.000.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.000.00.000.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000.00.000
