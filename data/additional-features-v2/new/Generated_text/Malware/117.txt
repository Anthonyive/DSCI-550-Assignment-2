A lot of people have asked me since the winter of 2006 what exactly I did as a journalist in the USA. There are enough examples out there to keep the whole thing alive. In just 4 years I had the audacity to say that I was a foreign agent and not a city official. I was arrested in the United Kingdom and the UK after a high profile terrorist attack on the London Bridge. I am the first foreign agent I have been arrested for.
I have a tremendous amount of respect for the UK and the people of my country. I am a local journalist and I have done my best to do my utmost to keep this country and its people safe. I also have a lot of respect for my country's leadership and the fact that I am a foreigner in my country. I believe that I am a journalist in the USA. I have made my name in the past by working with the US Embassy and the US Embassy in London. I have been a member of the UK government for over 40 years. I have done my utmost to protect the country's security.
I have a lot of respect for the people of my country. I do not want any of this to become a secret. I believe that it is a duty of every citizen of the United States to stand as a political, civil and political leader and have a very strong political and economic support for the people of my country.
