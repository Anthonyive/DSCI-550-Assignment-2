Betsy DeVos, an outspoken opponent of abortion rights and a supporter of the Defense of Marriage Act, has been the subject of some of DeVos' most high-profile role-playing to date.
In early February, as a speaker at the final meeting of the Senate Committee on Education and the Workforce, DeVos delivered a speech in which she urged the Senate to pass a bill to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, a bill that in her view would have helped to make this country into a more equal and just society.
The following week, on February 24, DeVos spoke at the same event where Ms. DeVos' speech was delivered.
The following day, in response to a question asked about her position on the issue, DeVos said in a quick and smart way, "I believe that marriage is the union of a man and a woman, and the people of this nation and the world need to have a say in the care for their children and grandchildren. I believe that this is the best and most effective way to do that, and I believe this is why I have made this commitment to you as your AG."
In a statement, the secretary of state's office said, "The United States of America has a solemn tradition of respect and mutual respect for one another, and this will be the case if the United States of America is to have the same respect and respect for the life of the person who chose to have this decision made. I believe this is why I have made this commitment to you as my AG, and why I am here today to tell you that today this decision is the right one. I do not want you to think that this decision is not based on the will of the people or that this will be a vote of confidence but rather on the wisdom of the United States of America and its laws.
I understand that you consider this a contentious issue. I have made this commitment to you as my AG. I believe this is why I am here today to tell you that today this decision is the right one. I do not want you to think that this decision is not based on the will of the people or that this will be a vote of confidence but rather on the wisdom of the United States of America and its laws.

You don't, and I don't want you to think that this is just another politician's game plan to get their way.
