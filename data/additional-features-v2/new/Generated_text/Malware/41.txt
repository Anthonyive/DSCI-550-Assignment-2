The party's chief strategist, Rick Baker, who runs the Florida office of the Florida Republican Party, is on death row for using his position as U.S. Secretary of State to engage in political action that would have resulted in impeachment of President Bill Clinton.
Baker, who is married to one of his family's top officials, is not just a top official in the Florida State Department of Management and Corporate Affairs, he is also a top official in the National Security Council.
Baker's role is in the state of Florida and he has an extensive financial portfolio. In his capacity as secretary of state, he is responsible for funds raised by the National Security Council and for the secrecy of his personal, business and personal banking accounts.

He has also been in unclassified discussions with the Treasury Department, Department of State, Department of Justice, and the U.S. Attorney's Office. He has not been in office since 2006, when he was in the position of chief of staff of the Treasury Department.
Baker reportedly passed on the money to his wife and children, a total of $120,000,000 in total during the period of his tenure as secretary of state. He has also passed them on to his children, who have been in the U.S. and abroad, which is why they have not been in the position of chief of staff for more than a year.

Baker's role in the current crisis is also seen as a key reason why he did not take any action that might have resulted in impeachment, and why he has decided to seek the release of the money.

She is the sister of one of his closest aides, the late U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
Baker has also pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering and money laundering.
He also pleaded guilty to being part of a joint bank account with a foreign official.
Baker will be tried in the United States for his role in the financial crisis. This could be the first time in the U.S. that a person has been charged with involvement in the financial crisis.
Baker's wife was also a subject of some of the most serious investigations in the world of business.
Baker's wife is now a U.S. citizen, and has been in the U.S. since 2005, when she was in the position of chief of staff of the Treasury Department.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Florida is handling the case.
Baker's wife, Diane, has since died.
