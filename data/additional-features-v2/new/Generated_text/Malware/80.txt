CALGARY (Reuters) - Alberta's economic growth has been strong since the oil price crash in 2008, and the province has been on the move to keep up with the pace of growth, despite the financial crisis that struck the province in March.

The economy has grown by 1.1 percent in the last year, with the dollar's yield rising to 7.25 percent, and the B.C. government's yield going up to 8.5 percent.

But for the first time since the crash, the province is losing ground.

The government said in a statement it was suspending the program of restocking and drilling in the province.

"The government has no business doing business with any private company that is not a member of the Alberta Oil and Gas Association (AOKG), the provincial government and the private sector," the statement read.

"The province is also facing the prospect of negative interest rates if the government does not agree to a new program of restocking and drilling in the province, which would put the province in the hands of private investors, who will receive a share of the revenue from the project."

In January, the province released a report on the government's financial state that said 22 million barrels of oil and natural gas were in disrepair in the last quarter of this year.

Asked if the government expected more than half of that to come from private investors, Alberta Energy Minister Brad Duguid said there was no basis for any doubt in his mind.

"The government will not be taking any action to get that this year's revenues are going up," he said.

If the economy is to thrive, the government can't just print more money and expect more people to come to Alberta.

"We are not in the business of printing money. We have the power to do that, and that is why we have the power to do it," Duguid said in his final address before the legislature on Monday.

Duguid's government has been trying to get the oil and gas industry to do business in Alberta as part of a $5.5 billion pipeline project that would carry the oil to the United States.

The plan is for the project to be completed by the end of this year and was supposed to start by next year.

The government has promised to save $5 billion by the end of next year, and to fund the project under the new B.C. government's new Oil and Gas Investment Development Program.

However, it has been repeatedly attacked by critics, and has said it is "basically a bank of honour" and "will not be given back to you".

In an interview for the National Post's The Oil Price, Duguid said he did not know if private investors would come to his government's assistance.

"I don't know if the money will come back to me in the next few months or not. I don't know if I will be able to make it to you in the next week or not. I don't know whether it will come back to me as soon as possible. I don't know if I will be able to make it to you in the next few weeks or not," he said.

Duguid said he was confident the government would come up with a response.

"I know the government is not confident in their response to the committee in question. I don't know if they have any choice but to come up with a response that will work in the interests of the government and the private sector," he said.

Duguid said he was confident he would not be able to make it to you in the next few weeks or not. He said he did not know if the government would come up with a response.
"I can bet you that the government of Alberta will not come up with a response to the committee and I cannot bet your money that they will come up with a response to the committee. I believe that the government has a good shot at the next $5 billion of investment in Alberta," he said.

Duguid said he had not been told whether his government would come up with a response to the committee in question.

In an email to the National Post, his office said the government had been told to send a letter to the committee by 9 a.m. on Tuesday to inform it of the committee's decision not to come up with a response.

"We have a serious and urgent need of you to understand our time and the urgency with which this cannot and will not be done," the email said.

On Monday, the committee's decision not to come up with a response to the committee's decision to come up with a response to the committee's decision to come up with a response was made by the committee's secretary, who told the committee's secretary that the committee had concluded that the oil and gas industry was not interested in doing business in Alberta and therefore
