Here's one that I knew I was going to write about. I mean, what a surprise to hear you are so interested in this subject. I hope you get to hear about it as well. I am Robert, a man who has always been interested in my life. He has been an undergraduate at Holland University in Amsterdam. You may know him because he is the president of the Netherlands Federation of Private, Private Education Associations (NEPA). I met him at my home. I was traveling to Amsterdam to meet a few of my Dutch colleagues. One of them was in the Netherlands government after they had the shipment of the main export of our products. I was in Amsterdam to meet with them and he gave me a few pointers on his position. I learned a lot about our company and our business interests. I also learned a lot about the international business, and the kind of country we have in Europe. And this is not just about this shipment, but also about how I have been working and how I have come to be a firm believer in the principle of equality and the free exchange of ideas. I am a business man and I am not interested in money, but I believe that I can be a successful businessman. I believe that I can make a difference in the lives of people in the world.
