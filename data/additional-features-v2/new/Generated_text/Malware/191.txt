MADISON, Wis. â€” A former Gov. Scott Walker has been indicted by a Wisconsin grand jury in connection with his role as the sole chief campaign manager of the Republican presidential candidate's campaign.

The indictment was announced Thursday by U.S. Attorney David M. Dean.

"I believe that Mr. Walker is in fact the candidate who should have been indicted for his role in an effort to undermine the integrity of the campaign by refusing to release the names of his political associates," M. Dean said in a release. "I believe that he should not be indicted for his role in this effort to undermine the integrity of the campaign by refusing to release the names of his political associates."

U.S. Attorney Dean said the indictment, written by former Wisconsin Attorney General and current State Auditor David M. Dean, was based on a letter the former governor sent to Walker in June 2004, a day before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, where he was the primary campaign manager.

The letter to Walker said: "I want to make this very clear: I am not the person who approved of or approved of Mr. Walker's campaign or any of his activities; nor am I the person who knows the political process well enough to make the required disclosures to the U.S. Attorney's Office. I have no direct role in this campaign or any of his activities. I have no authority over the matter and I cannot, and shall not, do so under any circumstances."

The indictment came less than two weeks after the former Wisconsin Gov. and presidential candidate's campaign for U.S. Senate in a bid to be re-elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014.

Walker's campaign was accused of failing to disclose personal information about tens of thousands of former and current state and local officials who have been charged with official corruption and other charges in connection with his presidential campaign.

"I have no authority over this matter and I cannot, and shall not, do so under any circumstances," he said in his response.

In a letter to Walker, he said he was aware that he was in the process of becoming a U.S. Senator.

"I have no direct role in this matter and I cannot, and shall not, do so under any circumstances," he wrote. "I have no reason to doubt the integrity of my government and the integrity of the United States Senate and the integrity of the United States Senate and the integrity of the United States Senate. I have no authority over this matter and I cannot, and shall not, do so under any circumstances."

Walker's campaign has said it will not disclose the names of the people indicted for criminal wrongdoing, but the indictment was the result of a series of private discussions between Walker's campaign and the Department of Justice.

Walker's campaign said in a statement that he and other top officials discussed the investigation and investigations into his private email account.

On Wednesday, Walker's campaign released a statement on its website that said he had been arrested in Boston, Massachusetts, that was later linked to a 2010 death in the United States of a man who died in a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

Walker's campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

R.D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said Tuesday that the mayor's office was informed that the indictment was on which it had been based.

"The mayor's office did not know what to make of this news, and we are working with the U.S. Attorney's Office to secure the release of the names of the people who have been indicted for criminal wrongdoing in connection with the death of Mr. Benham, Mr. Doolittle and Mr. Doolittle," Bowser said in a statement.

Bowser said he was not aware of the investigation into the death of Doolittle, but he was told that the death was an accident and that no one had been killed.

The indictment against Doolittle, Mr. Doolittle and Mr. Doolittle's wife, Tammy Doolittle, was handed over to the FBI in June 2014 after the state of Michigan discovered emails that linked them to a man who ran for president in a special election in a county in northwest Michigan's Wayne County.

The man, who belongs to a family of high-profile people in Detroit, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the death of Mr. Doolittle.

The indictment said that the accused had a history of political misdeeds.

A source said that the source said the indictment included an arrest warrant and investigation into a high-profile political operative who had allegedly promoted a US$10 million private jet to be used as a foreign base in the United States.

The source said that the indictment was in response to a request for information from the MI-13 Special Investigative Unit, the US government's private security unit.
