This is a very high priority for you.
The following documents are part of the contract with the World Bank of China
Acting Director for Underwriting Operations for the Bank of Nigeria (BND).
The contract contains a contract for the transfer of the security deposit of
three million, eight hundred and fifty thousand US dollars (Yakima Banknote) to
the Bank of Nigeria, a treasury account in Nigeria.
The security deposit was first paid to A,063,000
Dollars ($1.5 million US dollars) and
was subsequently transferred to the account of the assistant
account holder for the transfer of the security deposit to the
bank account of the bank.
The bank has a strict procedure for the transfer of the
security deposit to the account of the bank administrator and
the bank has to indicate the amount of the security deposit
to be transferred to the bank account of the next of kin
account of the deposit.
If the amount of the security deposit is less than that specified,
the payment will be taken into account as a percentage
of the total sum received by the next of kin
account.
The bank has the right to recommend the bank to
have the security deposit transferred to the account of the bank
as a percentage of the total sum.
As of July 31st, 2000, the account in which we deposited
the security deposit was not in a foreign bank.
Please note that the bank does not provide for us to be
transferred to foreign accounts for security deposit transfer
transfer.
In the event of an emergency, the bank shall notify
all the necessary officials of the Bank of Nigeria, the
country where the deposit was deposited, so that they can
assist in the transfer of the security deposit to the account
of the next of kin account.
Please also note that the bank does not provide for us to be
transferred to foreign account for security deposit transfer.
As a result of your assistance, we have decided to
transfer all of the security deposit to the account of the next of kin
account.
The next of kin account will be established in your country and
the deposit will be paid to you by your side for your
remittance to the bank account of the next of kin
account. The account will be audited by the Bank of
Nigeria and the next of kin account shall be
issued by the bank to enable you to invest your
asset
funds in your country.
The bank has also decided to permit us to
apply for and receive your deposit as a collateral
fund of your choice.
Please note, however, that if you are willing to assist us,
we shall inform you of the reason for our
request and we shall even release your deposit
as a security deposit for your use.
The bank shall provide you with a copy of this document
and will send
