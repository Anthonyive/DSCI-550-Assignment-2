On the day of my father's death, my mother told me to write down the names of my relatives and friends. I kept this secret to protect myself from my father's death.
It is a fact that the death of my mother was sudden and sudden in nature. It took me very long to find a partner to stand with for my father's death.
I got a call from my father's security company informing me that I had a non-contractable contract.
The security company said,
I need your help to fund my new venture. I have a lot of money to invest in this venture but this contract is not valid.
My business partner has said that his partner can not be trusted to invest in my venture.
My bank account is foreign and cannot be used to invest in this venture. My bank has been abandoned for this.
I now need the funds from my partner's bank account as well as from his bank account. At this point, this money cannot be transferred to any other bank of your choice.
I will not allow this deal to go un-executed and I will not be able to transfer the money to any other bank of your choice.
I am very on top of my responsibilities and this letter will be your response to the security company.
Due to the fact that I have already said no to this idea, I will not give you any information about this deal.
