A broken or broken-down building is a serious risk. But this is not just a case of a property go-through. It's also a risk in itself.
For security reasons I have decided to open an account with this company. I have a deposit of $30,000 floating in my account here in the US. The balance is being held for security reasons. It is a very serious risk for me.
So here is my note, a thank you for your willingness to help me open this account.
Thanks for your prompt response.
Kindly reply.
Respectfully yours,
Dr. Anthony Stetson
