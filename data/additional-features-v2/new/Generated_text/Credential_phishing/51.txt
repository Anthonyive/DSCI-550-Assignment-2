The president of the United Nations, Johannes Hahn, was a very famous and wealthy man. While he was president, he was assassinated in the Soweto massacre in Soweto, Nigeria. We shall be going over this in a short essay but I want to stress that the President of the United Nations, who was arrested by his political associates for some time after the Soweto massacre, has been awarded $20,000,000.00 plus interest on all debts incurred by him in the course of his life.

He was also a member of the United States Central Committee of the International Security Assistance Force (USCCISF) during World War II.

Mr.Hahn was a member of the United Nations military commission that issued the execution orders for Gen.Lazarus Dimitriou. The report was not a deal-breaker between the President and the commission, and hence he was not involved in the execution of its report.
