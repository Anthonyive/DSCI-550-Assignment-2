Note:
I am writing to inform you that the
business of my company was abandoned by the former customer,
Eugene Black.
In a letter to the following company,
Eugene Black, he told me that he would not be the
manager of my company for
the next five years. My brother-in-law and I
were the owners of the company, but he took his
pay for the next five years, so that he could use
his money for his own personal gain.
Now that I am about to write this letter, I need you to
promptly send me a few hundred dollars in bills
and other documents for deposit into your bank account
in the country where you have the money to
go into? You can send me the following
submissions:
1. Filed in your bank account, which is
in the country where you have the money.
2. A letter from my brother-in-law,
Eugene Black, stating the reason for the
dissolution of the company and offering
his money for the next five years.
3. A letter from my sister-in-law, who
has been the co-owner of the company for
the next five years.
I want you to help me get this money into your bank account
in the country where you can get your money into
your account.
If you are willing to assist me to get this money into
your bank account, I will also accept your
submissions; however, the deposit must be made in
your country where you can get the money into your account
and go into your account on behalf of your beneficiary.
And if you are willing to send me your account numbers
and contact information for the deposit, I will arrange
it to be successful.
Best regards,
Eugene
