I am Dr. Robert S. J. Brochstein, President of the National Council of Order of Pardons and Paroles (NPCPOP) of the United States.
I am writing an article entitled 'NPCPOP - The New World Order' which I am co-directing and co-sponsor of with my partner, Mr. Mr. David and Mrs. Dr. David, entitled, 'The New World Order'.
I seek your assistance in writing this article in your country's largest NPOP.
We are in the process of building a NPOP to manage the supply of hepatitis C vaccine for the World Health Organization. We are also going to have a major contract executed in your country's third country for your assistance in this deal.
Please know that we are in a huge political crisis in your country.
We want you to help us open up the NPOP to the world.
This proposal is from a foreign agent who in your country is a major political prisoner of the NPOP system which was established by the US, France, and Great Britain to transfer the money to your country for safe keeping and to disburse it abroad for safe keeping and transfer to your own country.
Your help will enable us to safely open the NPOP for you to use as the beneficiary, and provide us with the funds for transfer to your country.
This is not a political proposal, this is a proposal to consider the long term interests of the NPOP system in your country.
Please enable us share this proposal with your colleagues and co-workers in the NPOP system in your country and with your companies. Once you have been contacted and we have provided you with all necessary information we will allow you to come and apply to the next of kin to transfer this money to your country.
As soon as we receive your response we will give you all we have to share with you and your colleagues. Please, as soon as we can, seek your assistance in making this deal happen.
We shall then have to deal with the payment of the 7% of the total amount. We don't want to risk this.
You shall be the one to pay for the fixed sum of 7% of the total amount.
I propose that you be the beneficiary of the money transferred to your country for safekeeping.
Receive this information as soon as possible.
Thanks. Mr. David
We shall commence the transfer of this money, $5.5 million to you and $5.5 million to your country.
Before we begin the transfer we shall inform you that the money will be paid back to you by the finance ministry which will pay all expenses incurred by you and your company to you.
We shall also contact you to inform you that we have not secured your investment and interest in property in your country.
Please be advised that with no money to transfer to your country for safe keeping we shall need to locate a foreign partner or partner that can provide us with funds to the full extent of the law to transfer this money and you shall also be required to give a document with you which will enable us determine whether you will accept it or not.
Please be advised that we will be dealing exclusively with your company, which is also a partner of yours which has been executed in your country for safe keeping.
On the other hand, we shall be dealing exclusively with the contractor, which has been executed in your country for safe keeping.
You may contact you through The NPOP on the following phone numbers:
