Thank you for your interest in this email.
I am Mr. Paul M.K. and I am a member of the Davey Island Committee, a group of people who have been in contact with me for over 30 years. Since I was a child, I had been interested in contact with people from the Island.
I am a member of the Committee and I would like to present you with an opportunity for a business transaction.
I will once again seek your assistance to unearth the documents that I discovered in the mail, which I have discovered on my own.
I hope that you will not disappoint me.
Thank you,
Paul M.K.
