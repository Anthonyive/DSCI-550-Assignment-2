The first line of the official letter from the National Executive Committee of American Jews (NECAJ) to President Charles H. H. Dubois, requesting that his son James M. Dubois be ordained to be a New York bank director, was sent on the 25th of September, 1841.
The letter was attached to a special report in the Committee of the Bank of New York of America (CBNA), which was to meet in New York to discuss a proposal for a bank account for the next of kin of the bank director and the bank directors and other officials in that bank.
The committee was hearing from numerous bank directors, officials of various bank branches, and other officials of the bank. It was decided, during the committee hearing, that James M. Dubois should be the next of kin of the bank director and the bank directors and other officials in that bank.
I am now asking that you sincerely and honestly assist me in my efforts to get this proposal through the committee.
I have been told that Mr. Dubois will be the next of kin of the bank director and the bank directors and other officials of the bank, and that I am so very sorry for his death and illness.
Mr. Dubois was a young private who was a member of the bank board of directors and the head of a foreign branch when he was killed in a plane crash in France in October, 1945.
I have been told that he has the capacity to be the next of kin of the bank directors and other officials of the bank and that I am so very sorry for his death and illness. I am in the process of contacting you for a final and final communication with you.
I have also been told that your presence will enable me to reach you in person.
My request is that you invest in a bank account for the next of kin of Mr. Dubois and the next of kin of the bank directors and other officials of the bank.
I am still awaiting your response.
I will send you this letter as soon as possible so that you can assist me in attaining your desired transaction.
In the course of my investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mr. Dubois, I discovered that he was a former member of a foreign branch of the Bank of Africa, which was a branch of the Bank of the Congo.
The bank board of directors had been in charge of the accounts for a quarter of a century.
During this time, Mr. Dubois was a member of a bank board of directors and a member of a foreign branch of the Bank of the Congo.
He was the son of a former member of a foreign branch of the Bank of Africa.
I am so very sorry for his death and illness.
