This is a review of my work with the Council of the South-Eastern Banker Association, a branch of the Bank of Romania, 2008/09 World Bank World Development Bank. I've come to the conclusion that the Bank's World Development Bank policy of raising interest rates to meet current interest rates requires strong support from the Central Bank of Romania and other banks in the country.

I am the president of the Bank, and I am engaged in the business of running the bank. I am the only one who has the funds to pay all expenses incurred by me, including the taxes and fees that I may incur in the course of running the bank. The bank's world development bank is a part of the Bank's World Development Bank. I have the necessary expertise and ability to not only do business with the Bank, but also to deal with the taxes that may arise that might arise from my involvement, including the taxes that could be paid to the bank by foreign depositors.

I wish to express my utmost gratitude to you for your willingness to help me.

I am Mr. Klaus Korcic, a member of the Bank's World Development Bank board and a former member of the Board's International Committee of Accountants.

Before I write you this letter, I want to share with you some information that is going to enable you to better understand how I came to this conclusion.
