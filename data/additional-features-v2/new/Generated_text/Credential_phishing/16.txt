The first pictures of the building were taken a few days ago and will soon be very live-in.
It is not necessary to look for the first source of the building. I will be using my position as an associate to locate and document the building as soon as I can.
The main building is in the town of Njirard in the Senegal-West Bank. The main road running through the town is now closed to traffic.
It has been a while since I have seen the building. My first contact with the owners was in the email I sent them for the payment of the bills.
Before I can contact them, they have been contacted by a foreigner who said he was from Kenya.
I am going to have to contact the foreign customer, preferably a foreigner. The only problem is that I am not your customer.
After a trip to Africa, I discovered the building was still used for business and personal use.
Finally, when I was told by the owner that he could not be contacted, I decided to invest in a new business that I shall invest in myself.
Best regards,
Mr.Tajesh
