I want to share my story with you as it relates to the discovery of this news.

I was a student at university in France. I was researching for a career as a chemist.

My mother died when I was a child. My father died when I was in my late twenties.

Now I am a merchant in France, but I can't afford the bills because my mother died in a plane crash.

The government of France is still not able to pay the bills of my mother because she died without a home, so I have just got my first job.

Now I shall be part of a capital project for my mother, but I have not published anything about it in my papers and so this has not been my first time to get this information.

It is no surprise that my mother died without a home and so I want to share this information with you so as to enable you to to get the full information about this transaction with you.

My mother was a merchant who also worked with France's National Oil Corporation (NOC)

and I have been instructed to contact you to ensure that you are not involved in this transaction.

Please don't be an idiot and wait for the response of my mother's lawyer.

If you are willing to assist me here, I shall be the only one who cannot help.

Please, keep this information confidential and of such confidential nature as to enable me to get the full information on this transaction.

Good day Mr. God bless you. God bless you,
Yours faithfully,

Dmitry

Dear sir,

My name is Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Russian who discovered that the world has been lined with diamonds that were worth five million dollars, five hundred thousand and twelve thousand, respectively.
The diamonds are made by the top officials of a rich country, and the diamonds are held to account by the owners of the diamond business with the state.
The diamond business is valued at US$500 million, but as soon as the owners of the diamond business are discovered to be involved in the financing of the project, the diamond business is liquidated.
I discovered the diamond business at a local diamond dealer in Russia, who were also in charge of the diamond business, and so he offered me his services to start the diamond business.
Now I am leaving the country, but I have decided to seek help from abroad, for this reason I will call upon you to contact me to arrange for the money to be paid to me.
However, I will give you my full name and address, in order to enable you to get the full information about this transaction.
I am Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Russian working for the National Oil Corporation.
The National oil company is a top-secret government-corporate body with no clear mandate or authority. It is operating the country's largest oil fields.
The official position of the company is that of the president of the company, which is the next of kin to all the companies that have been discovered to be involved in the financing of the building of oil pipelines.
I have discovered that the diamond business is in jeopardy due to the fact that the diamond business is liquidated.
I am seeking your assistance to provide for my immediate transfer and transfer of the money to the next of kin of the deceased, that is, the company secretary.
Please, do not be an idiot and wait for the response of my mother's lawyer.
If you are willing to assist me here, I shall be the only one who cannot help.Please, keep this information confidential and of such confidential nature as to enable me to get the full information on this transaction.
Good day Mr. God bless you.

Yours faithfully,
