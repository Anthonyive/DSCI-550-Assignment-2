In late May, I was contacted by a representative of REX, Inc., a company that handles the sale of your service overseas. I told him that I would contact you via my contact information for the transaction. He then said that he had the authority to facilitate the transfer between my bank and REX to you. He informed that I had agreed to the transfer and that I would contact you in person and give you the necessary information that may enable you to understand the deal. I stated that I will be contacting you through your contact information for the transaction and this information will enable you to understand the deal.
Upon my reply, the representative of REX told me that he had the authority to facilitate the transfer between my bank and REX to you. I explained that I would provide you with detailed information regarding the deal and the necessary documents for the deal. He then told me that he has the authority to facilitate the transfer between my bank and REX to you.
This transaction is a huge win for both parties.
Received your confidential response on behalf of your bank in person!
Sincerely,
REX, Inc.
