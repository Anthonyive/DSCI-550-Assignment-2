It's been a while.

I was in a hospital, and my wife and I were going to
go to a foreign country for a day trip.
This is when an international business partner approached me to
help them export this product.
He said he was going to fix a building in the
Wong Five mills in the Pretoria area of South Africa where
we had manufacturing and warehousing in the past.
So I agreed to help him.
The next day I got a phone call from an
international business partner who told me that he had come to
help with shipment to the next of kin of the customer.
He said he was going to deliver this product to
the next of kin.
I was expecting him to provide me with information about
the customer so I called to say that he had contacted me
and said he would come and fix the building for us to
go.
After the phone call I got a huge surprise.
He told me that he had been in contact with a
foreign company for a long time and that he had
discovered the new shipment in South Africa.

wiped out the production line with the
supply lines fully closed.
I decided to contact a foreign company to
help with this transaction.
I said that I have a contract with the
foreign company to fix a building in
the Pretoria area of South Africa where we
will export this product to the next of
kin.
I said that the contract is in good standing
and the contract was executed without any issues
which is why I am now contacting
this foreign company to get a better understanding of
this
contract
