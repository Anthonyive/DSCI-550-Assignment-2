In the course of my search, I discovered a large sum of money (US$18.5M) belonging to a foreign person, and I have not paid it.

So far, the fund has been paid out in France.

So far, I have not received any payment, and the fund has been dormant.

Therefore, I am contacting you as a foreigner to seek your assistance in locating the money.

In conclusion, I have decided to seek your assistance in locating the fund for your benefit.

Please, I am audited for security reasons, I need your permission to commence this transaction.

Please note that my contract with you is confidential, and I have no other choice.

Please, please, for your honest assistance, I will seek your further cooperation.

Sincerely

Dear Sir/Madam

I am Sir/Madam.I am re-inventing the idea that more money should be paid into your account as soon as possible after it is paid into your account.
I will present you with the details of the transaction, for your safe return to me.
I have not been able to find you in this country and am still in a state of shock that this money is still in your account.
I want you to keep this money as an account which you can share with other people. You can share with your trusted relatives, relatives of foreign partners, foreigners and other relatives of foreigners.
I want you to know that your account was never a money account, but a life account created to accommodate your needs.
I want your understanding to enable me, as a foreigner, to enable you to call on the other side because this money is no longer a life account and is not being treated with respect as payment for your share.
The money is to be used to fund your personal expenses, such as dentistry and household expenses.
If you have any questions, please call me on-line or in private.
