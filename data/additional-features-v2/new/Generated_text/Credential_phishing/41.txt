My home is in the South Central Bank of Nigeria (SABI) capital city of Borno, Nigeria. The bank has a number of branches in the city, which are being used to facilitate the transfer of assets between Nigeria and the South American country.
In response to the arrival of my partner, I contacted you through my partner's telephone number. We now have a communication and we both want to share the following information:
1. Your full name and address.
2. Your full telephone and fax numbers.
Please note:
I am the Director of the Bank's Transfer Unit, which handles the transfer of assets between Nigeria and South America. I am able to provide you with information on the assets and transfer transactions we have seen linked to the transfer.
Please note:
1. We have not both met in person.
2. We all appreciate your willingness to share this information as we have come to the conclusion that this whole matter will be of no consequence to you.
Please note that this communication is confidential, your security and communication with me is no problem.
I hope you will not disappoint with this opportunity to share this information with you in a more confidential manner.
Best,
J.M.
Dear Sir/Madam,
I am working with you to transfer the funds from my company account to your bank account in your country of origin. I want to make sure that this money is safe in the bank and that your company will not betray your confidence in me.
The banks of your country are known for their secrecy.
This is because the bank has no security letter attached to this account, and therefore the funds are not safe to transfer to you
because of the nature of the business.
However, I was aware of the fact that your company is being investigated for safe handling of this money and therefore I decided to release the funds to your company.
I ask that you do not disappoint me with this information, because my company can be of benefit to you.
Best,
J.M.
