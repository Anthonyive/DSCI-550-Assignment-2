A great place to start is to look for a partner who can donate the money to your organization. As soon as I receive your letter I will set you up as a partner and send you a copy of the document.
I will contact you to confirm my choice of partner and I will use this opportunity to help you find a partner.
Best Regards,
Dennis

I want to tell you that I am going to be your partner for the next 10 years, because of the financial well being of the company that is currently in the process of securing the transfer of all the money from the United States to your country.
I am not going to change the name of the company, because I don't want to risk the company's reputation for my country's sake. I want you to be the one to give me all the funds necessary to build my company into a profitable business. My goal is to set you up as my partner for the next 10 years, when you will be ready to donate the money to the company.
I am going to present you with a list of all the parties involved, which you can view here. I want you to nominate the person that will be the next of kin for me.
I will then use this opportunity to set you up as the next of kin for the next 10 years. I will use this opportunity to set you up as a partner and I will use this opportunity to help you find a partner.
Best Regards,
Dennis Diakonyi
