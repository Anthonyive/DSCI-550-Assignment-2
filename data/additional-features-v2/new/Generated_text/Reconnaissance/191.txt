The U.S. government is imploding.
Our economy is going through the usual churn as a result of the second bailout.
The first bailout brought in by the government was for the construction of a new NIS 200 billion (US $39.5 billion) out of our own country's treasury, to support the development of foreign investment and also to fund the construction of new infrastructure.
The second bailout brought in by the United States government was for the construction of a new NIS 250 billion (US $39.7 billion) out of our own country's treasury.
This money is now coming to us through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United States Government.
Since the second bailout, the amount of this money has increased by over 20% from the original amount of US$30.8 billion (US$41.5 billion) to over US$46.5 billion (US$55.5 billion)
The amount of the money has also increased by over 30% from the original amount of US$26.7 billion (US$28.7 billion) to over US$34.4 billion (US$35.3 billion)
I am asking for your assistance to assure that this money will be used on important projects that are not yet done as we need an investment of over US$35.2 billion.
I will also ask you to have me make a written request for your assistance in this regard.
Due to the nature of the matter, I am unable to do this. I am asking you to assist me in my efforts to secure a foreign investment in this country.
I believe that the United States Government is currently under the control of the Federal Reserve and therefore, the transfer of the funds to your country has been a priority. However, I am not sure whether this will be a good outcome for the United States Government as the Federal Reserve may not be able to provide you with funds due to your past.
I am asking you to assist me in my efforts to secure a foreign investment in this country. I will also ask you to have me make a written request for your assistance in this regard.
