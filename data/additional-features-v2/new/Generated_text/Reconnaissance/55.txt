OBJECTIVE:

To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of adherences in the prevention of prostate cancer with the use of a three-dose IV, 5-HT, and 5-EA.

DESIGN:

This study was undertaken to determine the safe and effective use of the 3-dose, 5-HT and 5-EA for the control of prostate cancer and the prevention of prostate cancer by adherences in the course of the treatment of each of the possible types of cancer.

RESULTS:

The efficacy of the 3-dose, 5-HT and 5-EA was 80% and 80% for the 5-HT and 5-EA, respectively.

CONCLUSION:

The 5-HT and 5-EA are of high safety for the prevention of prostate cancer and the possible prevention of prostate cancer by adherences in the course of the treatment of each of the possible types of cancer.

CONCLUSION:

The 5-HT and 5-EA are of high safety for the prevention of prostate cancer and the possible prevention of prostate cancer by adherences in the course of the treatment of each of the possible types of cancer.
