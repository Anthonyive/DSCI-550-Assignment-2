AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) â€” A former Atlanta police officer in a federal lawsuit is in custody in the U.S. after he was rescued by a military helicopter.

Morton Edward White, 57, was arrested on June 25, 2001, after his car was discovered on the George C. Scott Highway in Atlanta, Georgia.

He was found in the car with the contents of a box that contained a handgun.

The contents of the box were found in a box and the contents were found in the trunk of the car.

The federal lawsuit says he was helping his father, who died with his mother in the late '80s, and her co-workers when the military hijacked a United States military aircraft that was in the country and took him there with a cargo of weapons and ammunition.

The suit says the second plane that the plane was making a fly-by was still in the air, and the contents of the box were still in the trunk, but were not in the trunk.

The suit alleges that the United States government and military officials used the box as a sort of oil storage facility and that the contents were shipped to a country where the former United States president was alive and who was to inherit the money.

White is seeking compensation of $10 million,000. The suit says the money was held in a military tax safe in Incheon, South Korea for the next three years.

The suit is seeking to hear from either the United States or the United States government as to whether the contents of the box were in the safe and whether the military or the United States government used it for other purposes.

White is seeking damages of $15 million,000,000.00. The suit says the money was transferred to his name.

A spokeswoman at the Federal Bureau of Investigation said the agency is investigating.
