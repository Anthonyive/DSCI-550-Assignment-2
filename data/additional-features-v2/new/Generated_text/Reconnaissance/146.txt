Astonishingly, it's not as if any of the above mentioned assets are in the possession of the Awan family.

The Awan family is a conglomerate (of a company and a government) that is based in Dubai. It's based in Dubai.

The company is currently under the control of a Dubai-based security company who is also operating in the United Arab Emirates on a foreign security contract.

The company is still under surveillance by the United Arab Emirates security company.

The security business has been recently transferred from Dubai to the United Arab Emirates.

The company is now in the process of an investment of over US$30 million,000,000,000.00,000.00,000.00.

The investment is now in the United Arab Emirates and the security company's management is asking for your help in the provisioning of funds for security in the United Arab Emirates.

This is also why I decided to contact you to assist with the offshore transaction of this fund.

Please also be alerted to any of the above mentioned assets if you are interested in helping us in the process of this fund.

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,

Ceissaire

Abdullah bin Hasan,

Banker

At least for now, no one has come forward to claim the funds as foreign, and this is because this fund is in the civil service with the Ministry of Finance.

It is also because of this foreign ownership that the fund has been registered in Dubai and where the funds have been deposited.

The funds were deposited in a foreign bank in the United Arab Emirates.

It is that reason that I decided to contact you in this regard. Since the government of the United Arab Emirates does not have any authority over this fund, I decided to seek your assistance.

Since this fund is not in the civil service with the Ministry of Finance, I decided to seek your assistance.

I am Abdul Hadi Awan, the chairman and chief executive officer of the Awan family.

He is the son of the late Sheikh Abdul Rahman Awan, and he is now the president of the United Arab Emirates.

In a recent report, the United Arab Emirates Government revealed that the Awans have transferred over US$30 million,000,000,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00.,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00.

The report stated that the money came from an investment made in Dubai and that the total value of the investment was USD$15.5 million,000,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00,000.00.

The report stated that it is possible to transfer the funds to another country and to claim the funds as foreign, but this is because this fund is in the civil service with the Ministry of Finance.
