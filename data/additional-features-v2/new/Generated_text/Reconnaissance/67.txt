At a time when U.S. President Barack Obama is trying to win over the African and Middle Eastern countries in the African and Middle Eastern region, to help the African and Middle Eastern countries to recover from a deep recession that has killed over a million people and destroyed over a trillion dollars in wealth, the United States has decided to invest in the development of new, viable investment opportunities in the United States for the benefit of the entire African and Middle Eastern community.
A good starting point for this investment is to invest in the development of new, viable investment opportunities in the United States for the benefit of the entire African and Middle Eastern community.
It has been my experience that these investments have been almost entirely political in nature, and that the most important investment on record for the United States is in the investment of new, viable investment opportunities in the United States for the benefit of the entire African and Middle Eastern community. I have always believed that the United States would not actually need the investment to attract investment funds in the United States.     I would also like to assure you that I am blessed with the opportunity to invest in the United States for my country's security and happiness.      I am so fortunate to have found this opportunity.  
The United States has always been a strong supporter of the right of the people of Africa and Middle Eastern countries to self-determination, and to the security of the United States.                   
Killed hundreds of thousands of people and destroyed over a trillion dollars in wealth,
the United States has decided to invest in the development of new, viable investment opportunities in the United States for the benefit of the entire African and Middle Eastern community.                
I hope that this investment will help to provide for the development of new, viable investment opportunities in the United States for the benefit of the entire African and Middle Eastern community.
