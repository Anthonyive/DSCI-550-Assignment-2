Funny question, since I got the message to read my reply...I sent out the following reply to these people:Please, contact me for further assistance.
My name is Mr. K.U.I SAHAN.
I am a 29 yr old student from Chiang Mai. I am currently studying Business administration in Ateneo-Christian University of the Republic of Thailand. I have been studying for my degree since the late 90's.I have a five year old daughter who is now three years old. She has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. Before my arrival in Thailand, I was a student in a private company that was recently acquired by the government. I managed to get my passport/passport expired and my passport was issued. I was told that after my application for the passport, I would be required to write a letter of application. I was also told that my passport would be forwarded to me in an envelope containing a total of $20,000.000.00. I was also told that I would be required to give all this money to the government for future use. I have a security clearance which I have been required to carry out for about 10 years. I have never been in love with my life, I want to move abroad with my mother.
I am the son of a rich businessman who was the head of a good company in Thailand. He was killed in a plane crash by his own son during the overseas business business.
The son got rich off of this business and after his death he was also remitted to the country with his mother. Since he was still alive, we decided to invest in a company which he is interested in building to be the next owner of the company.
I was also told that I would be required to carry out all necessary business transactions to get my daughter back home and to be able to leave my husband, who is now deceased, for the foreign country where he lives.
I am currently seeking for a lawyer who will protect me from any legal action against me because of the fact that I am a student in a private company that was recently acquired by the government.
Considering my situation, I want to obtain the necessary documents to expose myself as a foreigner to the country where I live. I want to leave my husband, who is now deceased, for the foreign country where he lives, where I had this investment, to the country where I am now living.
I am seeking to be allowed to have children of my own as they are the firstborn of my first wife, who is now deceased. I want to secure the right to have a foreign partner to assist me in taking care of my children.
Regarding the money, I also want to make sure to set up a mobile phone and internet connection in order to reach my mother-in-law while we seek for a foreign partner to assist us in the process. My daughter is now five years old and my wife is 25 years old.
I am asking to hear from you soon enough.
