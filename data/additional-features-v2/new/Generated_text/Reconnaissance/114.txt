UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Monday approved the introduction of a new set of sanctions on Russia over its military intervention in Ukraine's recent parliamentary elections, the Security Council said.

A special rapporteur on the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Secretary General, Christophe Laguete, said he was ready to assist the Security Council in curbing and/or revoking the use of force against the state.

Laguete, who was the head of the Security Council's security committees, said he was ready to assist the Security Council in curbing or revoking the use of force against the state.

He said he had a confidential 10-page document which he and his colleagues sent to the Security Council, which was written by Laguete, that will be used in the event of a foreign military intervention in Ukraine's recent parliamentary elections.

Laguete said he would issue a proposal for a special foreign international military assistance to be made available to the United Nations Security Council if a proposal is made.

He said he would also be willing to assist the Security Council in revoking or revoking the use of force against the state.

"I am also ready to assist the Security Council in revoking or revoking the use of force against the state," he said in a phone briefing from the United Nations Mission in Ukraine.
