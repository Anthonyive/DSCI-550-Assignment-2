ASURGENT SON OF THE KOREAN ROYAL GOVERNMENT OF THE KOREA
My name is IANS KURSEN. I am a member of the Government of South Africa's Council of Ministers (CAG) and the Government of South Africa's National Anti-moneyLaundering Committee (NAMC).
I am a member of the United States Treasury Department (Treasury) and the United States Government's National Anti-MoneyLaundering Committee (NAMLC)
I am also a member of the Democratic Committee of South Africa (DRCS), an important political body which has given close attention to the corruption problems of the Federal Government's Treasury Department (FED).
I also want to share some of my experience as a member of the CAG/NAMC and the mayors of the Bank of South Africa (BSA) and the Central Bank (CBN). I also want to share my experience as a member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).
I am also a member of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (EECAF).
I have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (Nobel Peace Prize) by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (EECAF) for my work to promote peace and prosperity in Africa.
We want to establish an African Infrastructure of Cooperation and Development (AMIC)
It is important for us, because it is a very important issue for us and is sensitive to our country's security.
We were convinced by the Security Council (SC) Resolution 1918 (2000) to give Africa the support and influence needed to aid the Government of South Africa in its efforts to remove the remit of the remuneration that was subcontracted to the Government of South Africa, to the tune of more than $12 billion dollars.
We now know that this remuneration is not for our country or our country's security, but for the security of the country and its investment.
Also, because of the strong relationship this relationship has with the United Nations, we believe that we should establish an AMIC to assist our country in this matter.
We are planning to reach a compromise with the Security Council for this investment.
Upon this we will seek to negotiate mutual investment of the funds that are to be used for this investment, a service that is unknown to us, and is not to be neglected.
We also want our country to be able to assist us in this venture.
We want to invest in a country that is free of corruption, the most important of which is the exploitation of public funds to fund the construction and maintenance of the country's infrastructure.
This is why we want to invest in a country that is free of corruption and that has the highest security standards of the world.
Our country should also be able to assist the United Nations Security Council in this venture, as we have the highest security and reputation in the world.
For this reason, we decided to invest in a country that will be able to assist the United Nations Security Council in this venture.
We will also seek to negotiate mutual investment of the funds that are to be used for this investment, a service that is unknown to us, and is not to be neglected.
