A few months ago, I was writing a letter to my Dear Friend, in which I insisted on going to a financial institution where the amount of money will be deposited and the amount will be remitted to the States. I have also got a reply from one of my former colleagues who is writing to inform me to give him the resale of the money, to which I have decided to give him all the documents of the money and the amount of money deposited in my account. I am hoping to complete this transaction and assure you that my family will be taken care of by the Government of India.
I have also got your reply to this letter. I have been awaiting your reply since my late husband died in 1999.
