The family of a 60-year old man killed in an earthquake in the South Pacific island of Cancun, a port city in the Philippines, has been awarded over $500 million for the family's assistance with the immediate release of four of his relatives including his wife, who were killed in the tsunami.

The business was handled by the company of the deceased businessman, Dr. Barungo Dr. Mariling (the son of the late Dr. Mariling Estrada Estrada, the late main architect of the Federal government of the late President Marcos and now the late President Ferdinand Marcos).

Dr. Mariling was the son of Dr. Mariling's father, Emperor Mariling Estrada Estrada, who died in a landslide in the late 1970s in a military attack.

During the war years, Dr. Mariling's father was killed in the crash of a plane he was carrying.

The company of the deceased businessman, Dr. Barungo Dr. Mariling, has been awarded over $500 million for his assistance in the immediate release of the four of his relatives including his wife, who were killed in the tsunami.

Dr. Mariling's mother has been awarded over $500 million for the immediate release of the four of his relatives including her son.

The family is seeking for a foreign investment company that will handle the sale of the company, and in return for the fund of over $5.5 million, the deceased, should be allowed to live in a country where he will not be a threat to the government of the country.

The family is seeking investment in a new nation with a better health and environment, and our country should get rid of all the major problems of the past.

Dr. Mariling's mother was a nurse and social worker in the United States who died of a heart attack while she was fighting for her life. In her death, she was described as a high profile multi-nationalist, who in the past had been a political prisoner.

Dr. Mariling's mother was married to a member of parliament from the Republic of the Philippines, who was murdered in a military attack in the late 1970s.

The family has decided to seek foreign investment in the country, as the process of the sale of the company is still in progress.
