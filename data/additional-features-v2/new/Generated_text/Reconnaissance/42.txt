Dear Sir,

I am Dr.S.R.S.I.P.I, the head of the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Development Program Partner for Central African Republic (CARDR).

I have been total failure during the last four years in my service as a refugee from the violence of the country and the infighting of the government's warring parties.

The country has been under the control of the United Nations Development Program,
until now. I have been unable to reach a reliable source to reply to your email and
respond to my phone calls and faxes.

I am Dr.S.R.S.I.P.I, a refugee from the violence of the country and the infighting of the government's warring parties.

I made a telephone call to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in your country
and they have decided to release me, which has resulted in my
dissenting from the United Nations Development Program.
Therefore, I am the head of the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations Development Program Partner for Central African Republic (CARDR)
for Central African Republic.

I want you and your family to know that I have been in a highly-enslaved position with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
since I was born in Ghana in 1978.
The funds are to be used to fund the construction of a new and more advanced military
supervision facility in the country with the assistance of the United Nations Development Program.

ready to assist you in your efforts to fund this fund.
