The incident happened in the southern Philippines on October 10th, 2017 with two foreign nationals and one Filipino student.
This is what I had to believe from the bottom of my heart:
The student was a student of a foreign country,
It was the first time he had been approached by me and my relatives.
He was seeking for a foreign student to come and study for the Philippine National University.
During the course of our discussions, we decided to discuss a business proposal which the student's father has made with my family.
Upon receiving this proposal, my father left me to take care of the student in his home country. Also, I sent a letter to the embassy of the Republic of the Philippines in which I stated that the student should declare his intention and that he will give up his student's father's country,
I also have requested your assistance in the maintenance of my school.
Therefore, I am asking you to allow me to carry out my business proposal in your country.
For this reason, I have decided to issue a certificate of incorporation and your payment will be made for the student and the student's father.
For this reason, I have also decided to issue a foreign passport to the student.
I want this student to be a member of my family who will be able to help me in this business venture.
I want this student to be able to assist me in the payment of the expenses of my school and the incidental expenses of my foreign student's return to the Philippines.
I want this student to be able to assist me in the application of the law in this matter by presenting the relevant documents to the embassy.
For this reason, I am looking forward to your response to help me in this business venture.
Yours sincerely,
S.M.
