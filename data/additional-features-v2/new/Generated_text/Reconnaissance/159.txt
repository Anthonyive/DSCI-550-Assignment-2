A war of attrition has been starting to break out among the warring parties. In the past two months the French military and security services have been trying to remove from the country the chief of state of the military, who is the son of the late General Sir Edmund Félix de Réa.
This is because of the positions that he holds in the National Guard and National Maritime Service. He is a major military strategist in France. He has been a close adviser to the French president during the late president's stay in Paris.
He is also known as the Duke of Saint-Léonimont, he is said to have been a military adviser to the late president.
The military is also convinced that he has taken many of his former military and security officers on the Voltaicrai Crusade, also known as the French Civil War.
Their claims are that he is from the country of the former king of Lesotho, the last of the kings of the Kingdom, who were killed by a US military force during the civil war.
The army has also been trying to clear out the criminal activities of the military leaders in charge of the operation, who were executed by the US military.
During the civil war the military representatives of the former king of Lesotho were arrested, but after the execution of the officials in charge they were released and the military in charge of the operation is now on their way to the disposal.
The situation is completely different in the military. The military has decided to remove the Deputy General of the National Guard of the Kingdom from his position in the National Guard.
The military has also decided to transfer the former king of Lesotho to another country where he will be able to stand as a civil servant, the same as the former king of Lesotho.

This is mainly due to the fact that the former king of Lesotho is a former political prisoner of the king of Lesotho. He has been in exile in France since he was executed.
This is because a report has not been made of his whereabouts, apparently he has left the country.
