And now for the full-fledged and detailed report on the contents of this document.
In the last tutorial I mentioned that I will be applying the principles of this document to the scientific research office of the Federal Government. The above message is not a very common communication among scientists and I am not sure how to convey this message. But I do want to emphasize that I was not a member of any political party. I was not a member of any political party for the last five years and I am not quite sure how to handle this situation.
I have enjoyed the political career of President Reagan and I am very interested in this project. I decided to request your assistance in this project because I am not sure how to handle this issue. For the past few years, I have been in contact with a foreign diplomatic authority who is actually interested in this project. I have been given the opportunity to become a foreign diplomat in order to serve as a special envoy to the foreign government and hence I am interested in it.
This is why I am asking you to assist me in this project. I decided to acquire the necessary foreign ministry licenses by IANS in this regard. I also raised the issue of the security of the documents when I obtained them. The documents were made available through this forum and have been forwarded to the foreign ministry's offices for their review.
I was nevertheless told that the security of the documents will be your problem because of the fact that I was not a member of any political party. I had no interest in this project because of the fact that I am not a foreign diplomat in this regard. The documents are part of an international agreement and I am seeking your assistance because I am not an official foreign minister under the law.
I shall also be of great assistance to you if you are willing to assist me in this project. I will be available for your assistance to talk to you and if you are willing to assist me in this project, I will be able to provide you with assistance.
Please kindly take the confidence of the foreign ministry office where I am currently residing. I will also be of great assistance in this project if you are willing to assist me in this project.
Thank you,
Dr. SANS ALBERT.
