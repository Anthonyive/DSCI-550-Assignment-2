I am a 26 year old male from South Africa. I have been looking for a handsome and selfless person who will invest my money, in my name and on my behalf.

I am willing to pay the fee of 10,000 US dollars (US$1,500,000.00) to have my name and the name and address of this individual, legally, called my father, Robert.

I need your assistance to fund this investiture.

Please send me your contact and phone numbers.

If you are able, I will also be willing to pay for your special services to invest in your country.

My mother died before she could invest in my father's country. I can only pray that you will not act as a consignment to the wrong people.

I also want to provide you with some details about the investment, and the money I will get from the scion of my mother.

I want you to know that I will be going through the financial transaction with the government.

I will be keeping a watch over the funds as I have decided to do in the interest of the country.

I believe that all is not lost in this transaction.

I also want you to know that I have all the necessary documents to invest the money in your country.

I will not be contacting the people of South Africa for your assistance in this transaction.

I am not going to be contacting the government for your assistance. I am going to fund the law firm within your country which will handle the paperwork for the investment.

I also want you to know that I intend to introduce you to the people of South Africa as soon as possible.

Before you get there, I will require your cooperation in the following ways:

1. Your personal and business information and documents may be of assistance to me.

2. I will have your private and banking details for the deposit and investiture.

3. I will be keeping the position of the scion of my mother as a secret.

4. I am willing to accept your investment for your country.

My only hope is that you will take this opportunity to invest in my country.

I hope to be able to invest for you during your stay here in South Africa.
