Dear Sir,
I am Dr. Gerald Thomas of London. I am the son of a late American diplomat and a late American diplomat.
I was the son of a late American diplomat who was killed in a Soviet air crash in 1963.
I was a company owner who was aware of the fate of our company owner. I was the only surviving son of the late American diplomat.
I and my brother had six children when the Soviet Union collapsed. I lost all my money and all my possessions and all my homes.
I was a very rich and successful merchant. Since my death, my son and I have been exhibiting the business and finance of our family. I have decided to introduce a bank and a major credit union as branches of these major credit unions.
I have decided to invest the entire sum of $10.3Million.
I am in charge of contacting the authorities in the Soviet Union to arrange my transaction with the authorities and to arrange my son's transfer to the capital of our country. I have also decided to give out a total of $10.3Million as a guarantee to all my creditors and me.
The money is an inheritance which I are asking for as a guarantee.
I am asking you to send me a security deposit. You will not be able to get this security deposit without your cooperation.
I will be contacting you by phone on the following dates:
I am afraid I will not be able to get your assistance because I have no money.
I am afraid that I will not be able to get you to give me a security deposit because I have no money. I am afraid that I will not be able to get your assistance because I are a widow and have no child.
I am afraid that I will not be able to get your assistance because I do not have any income.
I am afraid that I will not be able to get your assistance because I have no money. I am afraid that I will not be able to get your assistance because I have no money.
I am afraid that I will not be able to get your assistance because I have no money. I am afraid that I will not be able to get your assistance because I have no money.
I think you will do well to contact me to let me know that you are willing to assist me as a widow in this way. I will then take care of your future security.
Yours truly,
Your Highness.
Yours truly,
Dr. Gerald Thomas of London
