My name is Nancy D.S.My husband and I are the only surviving children of an early family. We are from the same family of merchants and law firm, and we are from Nigeria. We were in Nigeria as refugees.
Before we got to this remote area, we decided to start a business in the town of Moni, Nigeria.
We got a letter from a Nigerian business company that said that we have been dispatched to Moni with a package containing 3,000,000.00 (US$6,000,000.00).
We have been looking for a reliable and safe source to send us the funds which will enable us to start our business. Since we are in a small business, we decided to go for a business that will enable us to do business with the people of Moni, Nigeria.
