I got back a message from my old friends who got me a copy of the letter. I said that I was going to bring you back this gift once I got back the money. I hope that this will be a big success. After all, back then I only got a small amount of the money for the mail. As you can see, the money was deposited with a bank. I'm speaking of the bank of S.A. Bank of India. I don't know what the deal is but I will bring you back this money if you want it.
Thanks.

I have decided to send you a letter that will contain a detailed explanation of all the expenses incurred by this company and the reasons why I want you to be the beneficiary of the money. Please send the letter to
the relevant person and I will be glad to do business with you.
Please note that I don't want you to be a beneficiary of this money. I want you to be the beneficiary of a part in this business.

the relevant person and I will be glad to do business with you.
I've got a son and a daughter that are going to be going to university in the next couple of weeks. The son is going to have to go to a hospital and I want him to get back his money. You can safely expect a lot from them. So I will be sending you a fax with a detailed and detailed response. I want you to know that I am not asking for your assistance and that I am going to  send you back the money because I have decided to give you the money because of your assent. I am asking you to be very accommodating to the family.
