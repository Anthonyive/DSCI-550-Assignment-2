They did not know that there would be a flood. But they did not know that this would bring a huge amount of money to the camp. But they did not know that they would not be able to secure some of the money because the camp would not be able to pay the fees and we do not know how to handle this problem. So they decided to call on you and I am asking you to provide them with all of your documents and documents that will enable them to secure the funds. This is why I am asking you to assist us with the expenses of the camp. So if you are willing to help me here in Spain I will be sending you a letter of deposit. So I am willing to accept your help for the following expenses: (1) hotel charge of 75% of the expenses. (2) office and travel expenses of 20% of the expenses. (3) The remaining 20% (40% of the expenses) will be paid to the late Mr. Antonio C. Suarez. (4) Personal expenses of 30% for one year. (5) 100% of the rest for another year. (6) Money transfer to a private company. (7) Estate of Mr. Antonio C. Suarez. (8) Partnership agreement. (9) Money transfer to a private company.
So if you are willing to assist me with the expenses, I will be sending you a copy of the late Mr. Antonio C. Suarez's letter of deposit. So you can assist me in securing the funds and I will be sending you my actual records of your contact and business dealings in Spain. (8) I will then require your utmost assistance to charge you for the rest of the expenses and the consignments.
Thanks and god bless.
Mr. Antonio C. Suarez
Mr. I found out that you are staying in Spain because of your relationship with a late Mr. Antonio C. Suarez. I have a son, who is now in hospital after a heart attack and your son is in a hospital in Madrid where he is being treated for a lot of things. The hospital was built in 1992 and subsequently destroyed by the civil war. Before that I worked for a company that did business with the rebel forces. As a result of my illness, my company was hit with bad debt. My son was able to get a very good job and he got his money back. I decided to move my business to a country where I can get a better deal. Since then I have decided to keep trying to get a better deal and I still get no response.
I have decided to keep trying and trying until I get the deal done. I have also decided to get back the money that I lost in the civil war. But this is only my dream, a dream which I do not want to give up.
I have also decided to take the same risk as Mr. Antonio C. Suarez and will go through all the usual security measures to keep my son safe.
I do not want any harm to befall him in any way.
I have decided not to take any risk. But I am not going to make any secret of the fact that I have decided to do this because I have decided to keep this deal secret from all the people in Spain.
I have decided to tell you that I am not going to start any business because of this. But I hope that if you are interested, please contact me as soon as possible to confirm that I am not going to charge you any money for this purpose.
I am very sorry to hear your urgent and urgent letter that I got from you after talking to you in Madrid. As a result of your love for me and the people of Spain, I have decided to send you a letter of deposit that we will transfer your money to the same company which we have been going through with regard to this transaction.
I am sending you this letter for pleasure. This letter is for the purpose of capitalizing on your interest. I am trying to be discreet and discreet, because I know that you are looking for someone who will be willing to assist me in guaranteeing you the funds. I hope that you will trust me when I discuss the transfer with you. I hope that your willingness will enable me to negotiate the transaction so that we can invest the money in Spain.
Sincerely,
Mr. Antonio C. Suarez
Mr. I have only read from your letter. You have some good things to say about your business. I expect you to look after me and some of my children. But I have only heard from your ex-husband who is a business partner to the late Mr. Antonio C. Suarez. So I am going to give you some details about how you are going to use this money. I want you to prepare a detailed schedule that will enable me to deposit the money in a safe and secure manner.
I am going to bring in a company to deposit all the money in a safe and secure manner. The company will be run by Mr. Antonio C.
