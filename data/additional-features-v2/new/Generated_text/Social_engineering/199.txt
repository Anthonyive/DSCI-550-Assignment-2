Greece wants to set aside €30.9bn in emergency funds to fund a new kind of gas pipeline that will carry oil from the north-western Europe down to Europe's southern African states and across the continent.

The money will not be used to invest in oil and gas fields, but to fund the development and expansion of new European Union states and fields.

"Rather, the money should be used as a means of financing the production of oil and gas, thus helping to strengthen the Union's security and Western European security interests," a source in the government said at the time of writing.

The finance ministry said the money would also be used for further investment on the gas pipeline project.

The country's oil and gas industry has been decimated by the war in Iraq and the civil war that has ravaged the area.

Under the Anti-Corruption Law, any company that knowingly and with negligence is accused of corruption and is found guilty will face imprisonment of up to five years.

Consequently, all foreign companies that do business in Greece without a licence within the country must promptly return all relevant documents and documents.

The business will be for 5 years from the date of filing and the company is currently in readiness to invest for the next 5 years.

However, the ministry said that the company has no choice but to plead guilty.

"We will not hesitate to give you the necessary documents and the required documents to prove the company's ownership of the gas pipeline and deposit on the project," the source said.

The source said that the country's oil and gas industry is now in crisis due to the civil war and the collapse of the political leadership and the rebels.

The corruption, which will have a huge effect on the entire country, was discovered in the military government's Grozny Report into the Civil War and the subsequent war and occupation by the rebels.

The civil war left over hundreds of thousands of civilian dead and some 2,500,000 injured.

The depopulated country's economy became untenable due to an economic crisis, which led to the collapse of the country's oil and gas industry.

The government ended the conflict and declared the independence of the country.

Since the war, however, the government has decided to bring in the richest and most powerful people in the country.

Three of the richest of them, Sir Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, and the late Mr. Robert Menendez, the chairman of the finance ministry, have been arrested for alleged involvement in the war in Iraq.

This, however, only affects the few people who were involved in the looting and plunder of the country's oil and gas fields.

Therefore, the remaining members of the country's oil and gas industry are in serious doubt about their financial security.

I believe that this is because, as a result of the war, over €30.9bn of emergency funds that have been deposited in cash boxes, secret boxes, and boxes, and more are waiting to be transferred to a foreign bank.

This money may be confidential, but the secrecy of the money means there is no guarantee that the money will ever be used to invest in European Union states and fields.

Therefore, I am asking you to come forward and provide me with details of your financial security, including your name, address, and bank details.

This is how we will invest the funds:

$25,000,000.00 EUR

$20,000,000.00 U.S. dollars

$10,000,000.00 Euros

$5,000,000.00

This will enable us to secure the funds for a new gas pipeline that will move oil and gas to Europe's southern African states and Europe's outer borders.

We will also setup an office to invest the funds in Europe's largest firms.

Please all you need is a computer, a mobile phone, and a good computer/phone/datagram to transfer the funds.

Please contact me if you are interested in starting a business here in Greece, please enable my voice mail and fax numbers in order to contact you.

Thanks and good luck to you both.
