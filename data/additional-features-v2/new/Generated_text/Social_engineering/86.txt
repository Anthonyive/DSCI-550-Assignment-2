After the death of his father, the son left his home in the village of Kachin to go to Zimbabwe. He was arrested by Government officials and then taken to the authorities where he was further arrested and executed by the Government.

Since the death of the son, my family and I have been asking for your help in this regard.

Please give your full names and contact details as follows:

I am asking you to be the one to present the letter of the consent for the transfer of my son to the Government of Zimbabwe.

I want to know how you will deal with this charge and how you will assist us as we seek to establish the real ownership of the property.

I have given you a wealth of documents with all the necessary documents for a legitimate transfer.

I will also suit you with the guarantee that you will assist us in the transfer of all the documents in the custody of the Government of Zimbabwe.

This guarantee will enable us to secure the release of all the documents in the custody of the Government of Zimbabwe.

All documents are to be treated as genuine documents and I shall be bringing your assistance in this regard as well.

This guarantee is to be concluded in your name and that is why we have decided to issue you the consignment of all the documents as stated in the consignment documentation.

I will also bring you the contact of the Country and the telephone numbers of all the relevant Government offices.

I will be contacting you on our own terms.

We will in no way disclose your name, your address, your bank and the full name of the person who will be holding the consignment.

However, I will be willing to give you the full information on all necessary security measures which are required for a successful transfer.

I am asking you to be the person who will be helping us secure the full custody of the consignment in your name.

This guarantee will enable us to secure the release of all the documents in the custody of the Government of Zimbabwe.

In the event that you are willing to assist me in this transaction, I will transfer the consignment and all the relevant documents to you as soon as possible.

I will also be making a special contact to arrange for all the documents and documents to be seized from the consignment.

As soon as the consignment is reunited, I will bring the documents to you as soon as possible.

I expect your understanding on this transaction.

Regards.
