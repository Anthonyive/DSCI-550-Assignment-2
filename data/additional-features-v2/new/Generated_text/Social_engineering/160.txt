This is a very simple mod. I have decided to target with a mod that will remove all the clutter in the game, and give it back to you for free.

I will be looking to solicit your help to collect the money and use the funds for the purpose of investing my son with the same business as the original owner.

I will need your assistance to run these funds through the security system, and secure the funds.

Yours faithfully,

Yours,
