BEIJING/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's top nuclear expert said on Thursday that the country is considering a move to stage a nuclear test, the first by a major state nuclear company.

The former chief of the Nuclear Exporting Corporation of China, He Xilun, told a news conference in Beijing that China's government is considering a move to stage a nuclear test.

(Reporting by Daniel Cooperman; Editing by Sigrid Kondra)<|endoftext|>In the late summer of 2003 I got a fax from a friend who stated that he was interested in taking over the management of a private business that was going through a major change. He said that he was going to take over the business from the founder of the company and his son.
This was my first investment decision in the company. I decided to invest the money in a new and better business which I expect to bring the total to $5 million.
I have done this in the hope that the owner of this business will be able to avoid taxation. But, after the death of my son, the business was destroyed by the owner's son, and his son's son died a few months later.
I have decided to either convert the business into a company where I will own the remaining $5M and invest it in a new and better business, or I will invest the money in a private company that will provide security.
This is the only way I can bring the total investment to this late date.
Before I go further I want you to reply with your own story and your current condition. I will be contacting you through mail before the start date to discuss your details. I will be contacting you on the following days of the year:
My client is a total stranger who died a few months back, and I have decided to invest the money in a private company where he will invest the remaining $5M.
I have contacted you through email as follows:
Dear Joining me on this email is my client, When he died in hospital, he said that he did not want to move on to a new company, and that he did not want to lose this money because he did not want the remaining money to be lost. He also said that he would bring the money to the owner of the company, and that I would invest it in a new business which will provide security. He said that he was looking forward to investing this money through a private company.
I want you to contact me through your normal email address. I will be sending you information on the person you have said you are contacting, so that you know more about this business.
Thanks and God bless.
My client

With your help, I can bring this business to a standstill. The confidential information about the ownership and money transfer transaction will be preserved for future use with full confidence.
