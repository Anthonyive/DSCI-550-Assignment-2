I will be going through all the people who have the letter and the paperwork for you to be able to play with them. I will be looking forward to hear from you as I go through this business.
Thanks for your trust and I hope you can accept the offer because I am hoping to have you as my next of kin.

"You are the only one who have the necessary documents to come to this place. I will be looking forward to hear from you as soon as I know more about you.
I also want to hear from you as I am going through this business as well as your relatives. I will be asking for your address, phone and fax numbers. I will also want you to confirm your ability to play the game.
Please note that I do not want to put you in any danger because I am not going to give you any information about the game since I am not going to give that information to you. It is going to be some very short period of time before I get the documents, then I will need to produce them to Mr. (Mr) (Mr) (Mr) BANGKOK to show him that you are willing to assist me with this transaction. It is going to take about 20 days for me to come to you. This is how this business got started.
I have been claiming your services as the game owner for over a year now and I have never before ever claimed to have a child. I also claim the game as a child because I am very afraid that I will have my child killed by the family. I was also looking forward to have my child back because I am afraid that if I do not prove my claim that I will be killed.
I decided to bring you to one of our party places because I will have a large room with a room full of people to play the game with. I also want you to have the opportunity to stay with us for a while. I assure you that we will be there for you for a reasonable amount of money and that you will have the opportunity to be with us all for a while.
I will be going on with the business as I am going through this business because I have a new wife and a child, all of which I have already given to my late husband. I have my place in the Netherlands and I want you to be a part of this operation because I want you to do everything to get the child back as soon as possible. My husband and I have both been married for over 20 years now. We have lived together for 5 months now and at the time I am with you because I want to give you the child back because I do not want the child to be as sick as I am going to get. I am going to give you the child back because I want to give you the ability to play with you and have fun. All I want you to do is to stand by and accept this offer because I want I will be here to give you the child back because I want you to be with us all for a while and because I want you to be with us all for a reasonable amount of money. I am going to give you the child back because I want you to be with us all for a while.
I am going to talk to you once the child is about to be born. I want you to be with me for a short time and to keep on doing this business because we are going to go through our business as we have not met before. I want you to be with me for a short time because I want you to be with us all for a while.
I want you to be with me for a short time because I want you to be with me all for a while.
Before we get to the point where we are going to get the child back, I want you to be the one who will stand with me. I want you to be the one who will stand with me for your security. I want you to be the one who will stand with me to bring the child back to where he belongs. I want you to be the one who will have this child back to where he belongs.
