Two weeks ago we posted a video of a boy who was brutally beaten to death by his family. He claimed they had to help him escape because he got caught in a security breach. But when we got back to him he said they were not going to let us out of this country because of the security breach.

So why didn't they let us out of this country?

Because his family was a total loss because of the security breach. So why not give them a chance to move out of this country and bring in money.

So why not give them a safe house in this country?

As you can see the plans are to move the money out of this country in the next few weeks.

We are looking forward to hear from you soon enough.

Sincerely yours,

Eddy

Dear Sir,

I am writing you to ask you to help me bring my son to safety.
I have been desperately searching for two years now for a reliable and safe moving company to move all the money. I have been looking forward to this business for a while now.
I am looking forward to bring you as a trustworthy and well-regarded person to bring your full attention and support to this business.
Now that I have the financing, I want to move all of this money into a safe and secure house for me and my son.
I want your honest participation and assistance to bring out the best in me.
I know that some people will not follow through with this project, because of the risk associated with this business.
But I believe you will be the best choice for this purpose.
So I am going to need your assistance to bring this money out of this country in a secure house for me and my son to bring it out and into the world.
I am not asking you to give me your money in exchange for your help, I am asking you to help me move this money out of this country in a safe and secure house for me and my son.
I will also need your assistance to bring out a custom written letter of deposit and signature which I will need to get your assistance on this transaction.
I know that some people will not follow through with this project because of the risk associated with this business. But I believe you will be the best choice for this purpose.
So we can move this money out of this country without fear of retribution.

My name is Fredy (Eddy) and I am looking forward to share my story of how I got arrested and my father's money. I decided to go to jail for life because of the security breach. But then after my arrest, I decided to move out of this country because I cannot afford to lose my son. I decided to move out this money out of Europe because of the security threat. But my son lost his job with us because of this security breach. But I believe that you can help me move out of Europe before I lose my son.
I have a good friend who works in a big offshore company that is a major investment company. He is looking forward to share this story with you all because he knows that you are going to come back to me with your honest and 100% trust.
