How we got here

The news I got from the relatives was that my father is dead
and his wife is recovering from an illness
due to which she is now in hospital. I decided to get the money
from a bank that I have the power to have in my name
and this will enable me to buy a new home.
I will be able to pay all the bills and fees
and I will be able to give you all these details.
I do not want you to be afraid of death and
the death of my father. I want you to forget that you are
really only listening to the word of my Father.
I want you to understand that I am not asking you to
accept my offer. I want you to do the same for me.
I want you to be as patient as possible. I do not want you to
get in any trouble for my sake.
My only condition is that you pay with your
money. My only hope is that you will do the same
to my Father.
I have decided to give you all you need to know about this
business
