I am looking forward to hear from you as well. I have a lot of respect for you, and I wish you all the best.
I have also got some ministers who have the money to go to Europe. I have a very good contract with the CID, and I want you to give me a fair share of the money as the CID is a serious business partner of the late late Mr. David Kenyatta.
I am waiting to hear from you on your claim and whether you can get a company that will invest in you and your family to provide the best possible education and assistance to your child.
