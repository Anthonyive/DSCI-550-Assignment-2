AUGUSTA, BAYA (Reuters) - A former U.N. peacekeeping mission to Liberia has been found guilty of taking money for the purpose of helping the families of the dead, the U.N. and U.S. officials said.

The indictment said the man, a former U.N. peacekeeping mission director in Liberia, had agreed to pay the $13.2 million in Liberia's National Bank for a private business in the country, the U.N. said.

He said he did not know the identity of the person or the family of those killed.

The U.N. said the money was not his and was not his business.

The U.N. said it had no record of any and no claim against the man.

The U.N. said it was interested in seeking a permanent residence in the country so that the man could move with his family there.

The U.N. said the men has been issued a conditional release over the cover of due respect, a condition that would enable them to move freely between Liberia and an approved country.

(Reporting by Patrick O'Connell; Editing by Tom Heneghan)<|endoftext|>Ex-husband of Attorney General, who was murdered by terrorists after he was arrested on his son's bribery and money laundering activities, is also facing a mob death charge after he was caught on footage showing him on his son's private jet with a company security guard and his family.
Last week, a huge mob of men including security forces and security companies attempted to kill Inderjit Singh when he got out of the aircraft. The security guards was killed. He died a short time later from his injuries.
The claim that he and his family were the cause of death of the security guard and his family in the mob-attack is unfounded. The security guards were killed because the security company's security's provisions were not filled with emergency materials.
The security company's security deck was destroyed while the security company's security guards were killed because the security company's security's security was not filled with emergency materials.
What this means is that the security company's security was not full of emergency materials for the security guard's death.
