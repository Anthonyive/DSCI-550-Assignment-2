In 2003, the late Dr. Paul Wolfson, a caretaker for the late Dr. Y. Yaxley Tsonga, was killed by a mysterious car bomb outside his home. The next day, his son and I, a friend and former partner, were attacked by a group of 40-30 men, all of whom were under the age of 20. On the 24th of April, we were attacked by a group of 20 or more men who ran out of petrol from the Suez Canal. The group claimed that the group were not operating under the protection of the Suez Government, but were trying to escape the country through a private home.

On the 25th of April, a group of 20 or more men attacked us. After a few attempts, we were finally able to escape.

Following the attack, the family decided to evacuate the family and protect the remaining 20% of our wealth, including the hospital and the rest of the investment properties. The family then decided to invest this money for a home and where it will be spent.

This move entailed taking out all the money in a bank and the deposit and distribution and asking for a 60% share. The remaining 10% interest will be used to purchase a new house and a new certificate of deposit and distribution.

We are therefore asking you to assist us in securing this money to be deposited in a safe house, at a private home, and where we will be investing our remaining 20% of the money.

We pray that this transaction will be executed properly.

This move will also require the approval of the Government of the Republic of Nigeria according to the law.

This transaction will also require all necessary documents and a certificate of deposit that will enable us to secure the deposit and distribution of this money, including a certificate of deposit and distribution, as well as a certificate of holding, the relevant documents and the requisite all necessary security clearance documents.

Please also note that this transaction is not without risk.

As the only surviving son and I, we will need your assistance in the execution of this transaction.

Sincerely,

Nigerian President

Presidente
