With the debut of the new general manager of the Asa Mohammed family
as an elected political party leader, I am asking you to assist me in bringing the Asa Mohammed family back to the
21st Century.
I am asking you to assist me in bringing back the Asa Mohammed family to the
20th Century.
With your help, I will be able to guarantee that this
family will not be returned to the 
present state, and that all documents needed for this
government
will be kept in the hands of the people.
I am asking you to assist me and my family
to bring back these documents. This will enable us to
expect to pay for the necessary expenses
because of this
satisfaction. I will also be able to supply you with
information on what you can do to help.
This
will also enable my family to carry out my plans to
invest in the Asa Mohammed family to help them
get back their assets.
I have been advised by your assistance that
this money will not be used for political purposes
because the purpose of the money is to
help you to get back your Asa Mohammed family's money.
On the condition of confidentiality, I will only disclose
the
amount of this money among the family and not the people.
Please accept the offer of this offer
and your honesty.
Sincerely,
SATOMA.ELEANAMH.
