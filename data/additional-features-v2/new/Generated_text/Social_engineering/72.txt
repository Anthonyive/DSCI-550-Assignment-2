In the past few weeks, I've been working on a project that will go on for a while. I can't keep this up, because I don't know how soon it will be finished. I have a few hundred thousand USD in my hands and I want you to help me figure out what I'm going to do with that money. I am going to be contacting my friends from the South America and Africa, who are in charge of managing this money, to give you the details of what I'm going to do with it. I'm going to give you all the necessary documents to start with.
I am going to negotiate with you to give you the money. I am going to give you as much as I can give you of your labor, you must have sufficient status to be allowed to take this money. I want you to accept my offer. I want you to be very curious to get a sense of the condition of the money, because I want you to hear from me before I move forward with this transaction. I also want you to be very frank. I want you to only tell me about the money you have invested and about the condition of this money. I want you to be very frank about the fact that this money will not be able to go on as promised.
Before I move forward with this transaction, I want you to know that I am not going to give you any details other than that you are going to receive this money as a result of this transaction. I am going to give you the following information:
1) Your age and your company
2) Your actual salary and
3) Your full Social Security Number. (like I said before, you can only tell this to a husband/wife/husband's family.)
4) You are willing to donate some of the money to charity 
where you can give to more needy people.
I am not going to give you your contact numbers, because I am not going to tell you anything you might not know about this deal that I'm going to do with this Money, and I want to give you the full picture of this deal. I am not going to give you any idea what I am going to do with this Money, and I want you to be very patient to be honest. I am going to be honest with you, and you will appreciate that.
