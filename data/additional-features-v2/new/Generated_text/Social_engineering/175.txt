Dear Sir,
I am J.M. Simeon Gebo, I am the son of the late Sir R.F.R. Simeon Gebo, the late C.C.C. Simeon Gebo and the Chief Attorney of South Africa.
Since I did not seek a lawyer, I decided to seek out a private attorney in order to assist in my economic reform plan. So that I will use your funds on a company and I will give you some assistance to invest in this company as well as my own money on the following:
-All my investments for my son, I intend to invest as much as I can in these properties, as well as my son's personal documents.
-All my business expenses will be sent to you as soon as possible.
I have decided to send you the following documents:
-All my business documents
-Investment Summary,
-My Position and the Company
All of them will be forwarded to you by you.
I will then call you to make your decision on the company. I will also be sharing your full details with you.
I am looking forward to hear from you soon enough.
Best regards,
Mr.Gebo.
Your honest and professional response will enable my son to get a business deal with you that will enable him to invest the money he has earned in these properties for the benefit of his family.
I am looking forward to hear from you soon enough.
Best regards,
Mr.Gebo.
