I can't believe it when I read this. I am not a doctor. I am a farmer who is looking to have a home. I have decided to have this son as my only child. This is why I decided to give him the same name as my partner.
I am no expert in the health of my son. I am going to be honest and give you the full details of my son's condition.
I will not be lying when I say that I am extremely proud of my son. He is my son's son.
I was married to a farmer for a year and a half. I told you that this is where his condition and manganese deficiency came into play.
I have seen him for over 20 years now. I have seen him with the help of his family. He is going to be the son of a farmer for the next 15 years. I am not going to rest until I have seen that this is going to be a normal life.
I am going to tell you that my son is going to be as big as his mother ever dreamed of. This is because I am going to invest the money in a business that will enable him to buy a house with all the expenses in one go. This will either be a business of my son's that will benefit him and my family, or a business that will benefit myself and my son.
I will be sending you my actual financial papers, this will be my full name and last known address. I shall be asking you to get back the money and your support.
I know that this is something that needs to be said with absolute confidence to all of you. I can assure you that the funds are going to be used to buy properties and farms in the area of this farm owned by your support.
I want you to have the absolute confidence that I will not be lying about this business and that this money will not be misused against my son.
