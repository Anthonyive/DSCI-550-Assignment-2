INTRODUCTION

This is the first of a series of recent articles that will build on the above four and a half years of research and analysis that I had conducted and that made me not only know more about the game but also the people that made this game possible.

I have been looking forward to writing you for a long time, but now I know that you are not interested in the game.

What is the purpose of this letter?

This letter was made to you to present you with a list of individual people that make this game possible. This list will then be used to start and then to further develop the game and to list the supposed business partners behind this game. I will provide you with a list of the business partners that I have with us to be contacted by all the relevant government agencies and people in charge of it.

I hope that this letter will send a clear message to you that this game is not to be encouraged by anybody, and that I am not making any secret of this fact. I hope that you will be able to understand what I am trying to do here.

Sincerely yours,

SILENT SOURCE
