The US Government has decided that the country shall not receive any assistance from any foreign country for a period of three years. Upon receipt of your request, we shall give you a receipt of the total amount of expenses incurred by us until all reasonable expenses have been paid.
We will also forward your requested funds for the transfer to the highest security office of the US Government in the same country where we are located.
This account shall be fully managed by a security company and will be subject to the same terms as the US Government.
The Government of the United States of America will be fully responsible for all costs incurred by the country due to our participation in the process.
Please contact us by e-mail at:www.wholenamenetwork.com and we will issue you 5-7 days notice of the transfer to provide you with all your documents, documents of record and all necessary information needed for the transfer.
If you are still with us, we will be happy to assist you with the transaction and we shall be glad to provide you with any necessary assistance to enable you to re-enter the United States.
Your best regards.
United States Department of Commerce,
Telecom and Information Service.
