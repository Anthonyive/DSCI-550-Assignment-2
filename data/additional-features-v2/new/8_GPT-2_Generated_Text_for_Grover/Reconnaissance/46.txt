Briefly, Ivy Johnson was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the United States. While I was a member of the ACLU, I was named the next Vice President of the United States for the next twenty-five years. I was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 by President George W. Bush for his efforts in ending the war in Iraq.
Ivy was arrested by the United States government on 10/18/2004. He was tortured and killed in an American military base. He was executed after he refused to cooperate, and his body was found in a field outside the United States.
During his execution, he was left with only his head and face, and his arms and legs were left strewn across the field.
Ivy was brought before the United States Supreme Court in the United States District Court for his involvement in the murder and the murder of the civil rights leader Mohammed al-Bakra. The Supreme Court decided to hear my appeal.
The appeal was to the United Nations. I was very grateful for the opportunity to be heard. I would like to include a copy of your letter of appeal here.
Ivy is a former POW, but soon after his death he was transferred to the United States as a prisoner of war in the Korean War. Since his death he has been in the custody of the United States for all the torture and murder, and has been in the custody of the United States for the last fifteen years.
It is my hope that this letter be of assistance to you and your family.
Sincerely,
Mrs.C.S.
