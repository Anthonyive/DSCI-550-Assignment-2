This week on SI's Road to the White Rabbit podcast, I meet with a new member of the Review Board.
He is a member of the Review Board project. In my brother's years as a member, I was told that most of the war time money was unclaimed. This has made it very difficult for the Review Board to seize the money.
I told him that because of the war, I want him to look into this and I want to get the money back.
He agreed to this and after we met with the Chairman of the Review Board, I got him to come to my office in London.
The Review Board is a non-profit organization which is registered with the London office of the foreign office of the National Bank of England.
It is the main business of the joint venture between British and foreign investment firms in the area of foreign exchange.
We have worked hard to get this project started and are now working with the private investment firms to form a new fund under the name of Investment Fund, to be used to invest in the area of foreign exchange.
The money is to be used to buy the new aircraft that we are working on and to build a new training facility.
I will be here to discuss with you the details of this project and what you will do with this money.
As soon as we are able to get this project off the ground, you must give it your full attention. I am glad to have you here and my name is Patricia.
As I start my life as a foreigner, I know that I am not the only one to get this project off the ground to use for foreign investment.
The world needs foreign investment, and foreign investment is a growing problem in foreign nations.
As such, I want you to assist me in this. You are the only person who can do this task.
I am Dr. Nabil al-Mohammed, a member of the Review Board.
I worked with the British Foreign Office to develop the project. The project was to have the following objectives:
Aircraft acquisition of a high level of capability and the establishment of training facilities.
Training in a military or intelligence branch.
Time for the establishment of a verification agency that must carry out the work of the project.
The establishment of a foreign bank in the area of foreign exchange.
The creation of a training facility.
The establishment of a new organization that will deal with foreign investment.
The making of a proposal for the transfer of the funds.
The filing of new and amended tax returns.
The management of the project.
The administration of the project.
The payment of the expenses of the project.
We are very glad to invite you to come and discuss this project with us.
If you are interested in joining our review board, we would be glad to hear from you.
If you would like to contact me immediately via telephone or fax, please contact me as soon as possible.
