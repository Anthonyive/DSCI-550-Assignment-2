"I am really sorry for this delay, as I have been very busy. I have been doing this for over a year. I thought this had been a very important issue in my life. Before I died, my husband and I were alive. In the last few days, I received a telephone call from my boss. I said, 'I am in a gallows with your boss. I want to hear from you. Please come and talk to me.' I got some reply from you immediately. I am very sorry for this delay. I am very tired and I am in a very bad condition.
I have been using my emergency room for over 4 months now. I am getting a little more and more worked up. I have made very good efforts to get you to see me in hospital, but I am still in a very bad condition. I am quite ill now and the doctor wants you to get your hand clean of all your hair and body hair. At the moment, I am still very busy working.
I am going to get you to see my boss and his condition. I am going to get you to see my husband and his condition. I am going to get you to see the doctor because he is a very smart and well-travelled man. He is very careful to ensure that I do not get any serious health problems. I am going to get you to see me in hospital. I am very glad that you are interested in this opportunity.
Sincerely,

Dear Dr. Chestert
The telephone numbers I got were from a gentleman in the United Kingdom who was on the phone with the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, who stated that the annexation of the Russian government, in the form of a fund which has been set up for the benefit of the country, in order to enable foreign investment, is prohibited, as we are not the most reliable and leading companies, but I am convinced that this money will enable this country to acquire the necessary equipment for the construction of facilities, and to produce products for the defense industry. He told me that we are going to assist the Russian government in this matter by providing a fund which will enable us to get the equipment for the construction of the facility, and to produce products for our country. While the fund is being set up, I will be contacting you to discuss this matter. Please contact the finance person for details. I will be more than glad to assist you in any way of payment, and will be glad to assist you in any way of payment of money which has been set up hereunder.
Sincerely,
