I'm starting the process of writing a paper for the European Commission. I decided to take over the role of the Commission for the proposal. I will be writing this paper for you, the European Commission, because I want you to know that I know that if you want me to do it, you must be the one who wants it. I don't want you to be alone in this venture. I don't want to be without you. I want you to have a say in the decision and you must want me to invest the money in you. I want you to be the ones who decide whether it should be invested or not. The thing is, if you want me to invest the money, I do not want you to buy my products. I want you to have the financial security of the Commission. I do not want you to invest your money in any companies that fail to sell their products to the Commission. I want you to know that I do not want any one to steal your money and I want you to be the ones who decide where the money will be spent. I want you to know that my chief partner (former president) has made known to me that he intends to invest the money in you, and that he wants you to take the risk of the Commission. I don't want you to be alone in the decision and I don't want you to be afraid of the Commission.
