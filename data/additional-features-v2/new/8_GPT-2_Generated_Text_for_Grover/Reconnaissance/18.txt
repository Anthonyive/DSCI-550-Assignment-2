It's a clever idea to have your business address, telephone number, fax, and email address in the database, as your individual sales representatives. I am seeking your assistance in setting up a business account, and then out of the blue, I will transfer your business address to my home, the only thing I need is your assistance in setting up a business account for me. I will also give you a telephone number and fax number for support and assistance.If you can tell me your name and a telephone number for me, I will reply to you with your contact details.Thanks.

The BSA's United States Bureau of Standards
Department of Commerce. Since the end of the war,
the United States Government has been concerned with the
buggery of the goods and services we produce in
some countries. The recent
accident by a group of foreign security contractors resulted in
the theft of over $100 Million dollars of
American and foreign currency. This led to a
thinking process of all the banks, banks and financial
operations in the world where the security contractor,
M.L.
F.R., some years ago decided to lift the
Government of the United States out of the way of the
government
of Zimbabwe. Then the security contractor,
M.L.
F.R., purchased and used almost all
of American and foreign currency which has since been stolen
and when he got out, he discovered that the
government had not got the necessary bills, we have
all been safe from the security contractor for over
three years now. The security contractor is
currently in prison but is presently ready to be released.
I am willing to help you set up a business account for me
as well as my company, who will be responsible for the funds
now being transferred out of the United States. I will also have the
asset(s) and your secret code(name)
for all communication with the United States. I am afraid that you will not get any
response from me after this. I am currently
working on a project on your behalf.
I know that you are very interested in setting up your own business account
and/or business partner in this area. I am very
comfortable with your idea and look forward to your approval.
Sincerely,
Doug Louise
