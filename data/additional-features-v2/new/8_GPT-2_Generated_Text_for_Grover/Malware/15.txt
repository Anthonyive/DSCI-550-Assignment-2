'The head of the U.N. Children's Fund has said that there is no need to discuss or discuss the issue of child refugees in any country where there are no children. But, he said that this is not a million miles away from my house in the country of my birth. I want my children to come home to me and they are my children.

'My father who was born here in the UK, was a successful merchant in the West Midlands. He died in a car crash on the way to work. He was accompanied by his wife and their three children. The children have now been orphaned and the only thing they have left is the money, they decided to take it out to fund their family abroad. I had a family of seven kids before I moved here, they are now all just orphans. But they are the only ones left. I have told them that I am expecting a family of seven kids, they are now just orphans. We are just two of our associates, the other two are really just parents. I have told them that I am expecting a family of seven kids, that is why I am asking them to send me the money. I want to be able to take the money with me and the children, but I am also asking that they have the right people to come to my house. This is because I work with the United Nations Children's Fund. I want our kids to be safe and in good health, so I have set up a safe house in the family. I am also asking that my kids come to my parents' home to have a private meeting with them. This is because my parents are not here, they are in the United Nations child protection organization. They are supposed to be a guardian to my kids.
