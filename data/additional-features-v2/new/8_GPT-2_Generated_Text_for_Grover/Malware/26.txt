JERUSALEM (Ma'an) - The Arab League has released a statement to the Palestinian Authority, insisting that they do not expect to be successful in the Non-Proliferation Peace Initiative (NPA)/Yasser Arafat's (PA) highly anticipated, three-year policy of peace, security, and civil partnership with the Palestinian Authority.
The statement issued by the Arab League states that that the two sides in the NPA/Yasser Arafat peace negotiations are not interested in any more negotiations or cooperation.
The involvement of the Palestinian Authority in the NPA/Yasser Arafat peace negotiations is an internal matter, as it is not an official part of any government in any country.
The two sides have been in a peace process for over four years, and the Palestinian Authority has managed to avoid conflict with the Palestinian Authority and the capital, Nablus.
After the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority agree upon a plan for a two-state solution, the two sides have to present a security proposal to the UN Security Council, in which they would like the Security Council to approve the security proposal and have it executed.
Since the NPA/Yasser Arafat was assassinated in 2000 during a political crisis, the Palestinian Authority has brought down the Palestinian Authority with massive security and security assistance.
The security proposal would be executed by the Security Council, which would then have to approve the proposal, after which the security proposal would come up for a final vote before the Security Council could approve it, in which the Security Council would then have to approve the proposal as well.
According to the security proposal, the security plan would be based on the following four principles, which include the following:
1) The Security Council would have to approve or deny the proposal after the Security Council has to approve the proposal.
2) The Security Council would have to approve or deny the proposal after the Security Council has to approve the proposal.
3) The Security Council would have to approve or deny the proposal after the Security Council has to approve the proposal.
4) The Security Council would have to approve or deny the proposal after the Security Council has to approve the proposal.
According to the security proposal, any proposal that is not so successful as to be unsuccessful would be considered a security weakness and would be confiscated.

In order to be successful in the NPA/Yasser Arafat peace negotiations, the Palestinian Authority would have to give up everything they have gained from the NPA/Yasser Arafat peace negotiations and maintain the status quo of the NPA/Yasser Arafat peace negotiations.
