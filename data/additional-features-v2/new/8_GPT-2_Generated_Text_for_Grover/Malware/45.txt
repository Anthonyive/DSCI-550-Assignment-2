HOLD IT FOR JUST A MINUTE. I AM HOLDING YOU THIS DAY.
Greetings,
This is my partner who will be my next partner today.
I am Yassera Wadiah, a married mother of two at the moment.
I am from the family of a huge family, there is a real sense of humor and sorrow in my life, but also heartbreak when I look back on those days.
I came to the United States with my husband and three children; a daughter and son.
Since then, a lot of things have happened in our lives. I met my husband during our days; we met on the bus here in the United States.
My husband and I met at an event for people who have met someone through a Foreign Policy Forum in 2004; as soon as I met him, I decided to come to this country because he is an Arab.
Now, I will be the only one to witness the event but it will be my last day as a married man.
I am Yassera Wadiah, and I wish to share this event with you because I am so grateful to be a part of this family.
I have lived with my husband and his three children for over 30 years now. I was a married mother of two and before that, a husband and two children.
I have spent the last ten years living in the United States with my husband, my husband and my children, although I have been divorced for the last ten years.
I have met my husband and his children through various foreign policy forums. Most of the time, this has been linked to the political crisis in Iraq, but the most important thing is that I have made this decision to share this event with you.
Before my marriage, I married my husband because he was the only father of my children. My husband and I had a child and son, a son and a daughter, but for the most part, this is about my son and daughter being married to each other in the United States.
Before our marriage, my husband was a farmer and all my children are farmers and they are all very poor.
After my husband took me to the United States, I decided to come to this country to see my children where I am from and to share this event with you.
I will be accompanied by my husband and his three sons and their two daughters.
I just want to share this event with you because the risk of the situation in Iraq is very high.
My husband and I believe that if we meet again, we will have a chance to meet face to face and share this event with you.
I am Yassera Wadiah; I am the daughter of a farmer and she was my mother. I was married to my husband for the last 10 years.
Now that I am married, I wish to share this event with you because I feel so blessed to have met you.

My husband and I have come to this country because of the crisis in Iraq. I am now in a position of being the only one who can help me and my children.
I am the only one in the family to have a child born in Iraq; I am the only one to have a child born in the United States.
Now that I am married again, I want to share this event with you because I believe that if we meet again, we will have a chance to meet face to face and share this event with you.
