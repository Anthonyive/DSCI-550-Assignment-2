Khaleda Helsid, a British citizen and member of the black-rooted Muslim Brotherhood, was arrested on 14 July for his alleged involvement in the financing of the aegis of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. His trial lasted for five weeks before a jury of four men and four women, who unanimously unanimously declared him not guilty by reason of insanity. The prosecution claimed that he was assassinated by members of the Muslim Brotherhood.
During this trial, the trial court unanimously decided that he was not a war criminal, that he was a citizen of Sudan, and that he was responsible for the total collapse of the country. The jury decided that he did not have any relation to the Muslim Brotherhood or any other political party or organization.
During this trial, the trial court also concluded that he did not have any political or financial involvement with any political party or organization, that he was not involved in any political activities anywhere, and that he was not a member of any international political party or organization.

The trial court concluded that he did not have any financial involvement whatsoever with any political party or organization, that he was not involved in any political activities anywhere, and that he was not a member of any international political party or organization.
Before he died, he consented to an execution on his behalf by a church elder that was made out of the dead people.
The execution was carried out by a security service and the church elder was not alive to look for him.
The next day, the church elder was able to look for him and found him in a church that I had visited in Sudan for numerous years. He died in his arms. I have a proposal to you that should be forwarded to you by a high authority in your country. I want you to assist with the transfer of this sum to your country.
I have a son and we are looking forward to be married for a very very long time, hence why I am contacting you.
I want you to know that I am giving you 100% of the total sum of the money. I will also be giving you the share in any business venture that you engage in. You can only donate this money to any church that the church elder is able to work with. I will give you 30% of the total sum.
Please, if you are willing to assist me, please send me a private email address
