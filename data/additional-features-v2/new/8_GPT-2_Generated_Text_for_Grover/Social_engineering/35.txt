U.S. PRESIDENT ADEM
DEAR SIR,
I am writing to you to seek your assistance to get me to claim the release of the documents we have for you and for your assistance in both this and the next year as the result of which I will assist you in waging war against the Federal Government of the United States of America in order to retrieve the documents necessary to enable us to establish a reliable government in your country.
I am Mr. Robert F. Haskins from the Federal Government of Nigeria. I am in charge of the National Security Branch in charge of Security of Nigeria for Nigeria. I and my family have been in exile in the United States for over 40 years, but have never met.I have always maintained that the President of Nigeria, Mr. President Muhammadu  Kabila, is the Most Powerful God in the world. I have a son, Mr. Robert, who was killed by Boko Haram, but the President of Nigeria was killed before he could be re-elected. So I decided to seek for the release of these documents and they are in our possession.
I told you that I have got documents that claim the release of the documents but I will be glad to assist you if you are willing to assist me in this.
I want you to be my next of kin and I will only want to claim the release of these documents so that we can establish a reliable government in your country.
Thanks and God bless.
Regards,
BENEFICIARY
Mr. Robert F. Haskins
