I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and the Harry Potter films.
This is why I decided to make a website for you to share your interest,
I am looking to share information about Harry Potter and the Harry Potter films,
this is why I decided to do this website,
my name is Shijun Obeidu from Guinea. I am married to the late Shijun Obeidu, a.k.a. Mr. Harry Potter.
I am married to the late Shijun Obeidu from Sierra Leone.
I am a United States citizen with a child that died when he was a child.
My late husband was a highly-regarded and highly well-liked man.
He was among the first leaders of Liberia to declare unclaimed war claims on the land of his country.
He was the first to crash the Congo and to trade with the European Union.
After the war, he was forced to flee to Europe as a refugee
and later died on the way.
Before his death, his son, Mr. David Potter died.
Since his death, my husband has been trying to bring him back to the family.
But finally, I got a telephone call from the Ministry of the late Mr. Paolo Obeidu,
who said that he was going to bring him to the embassy in Dakar where Mr. David Potter was born.
I was going to bring him to Dakar to give him a better life. I decided to make this website to share the best
information I have about Mr. David Potter and his son,
this website is going to serve as a personal contact for you.
I want you to be as surprised and amazed as I was ,as to the ultimate result of this proposal.
My name is Mr. William M.B.U.Iuwe, President of Liberia.
I am the son of former president, Mr. Charles Uwe uwe who was assassinated in a coup in Liberia in 1999.
My father was one of the country's leading propagandists for the rebels against President Robert Mujica.
When the rebels were overthrown he led a coup in Sierra Leone to oust his then president, Uwe.
We were the only surviving son.
My father and I were both killed in a complete and total surprise attack by the rebels while we were in exile in Europe.
My mother,who was a childless widow, was the one who was responsible for my mother's death.
My father was so well-liked in Europe that he was a major supporter of the rebels in Sierra Leone.
My mother was also a reliable diplomat with the European Union.
My father died in a major plane crash while in exile in Europe.
My mother's family in Europe were utterly destroyed by the rebels.
My father was in exile in Europe for some years before he was discovered murdered in a plane crash in Nigeria.
My mother was the only surviving son.
My late father was also a leading propagandist for the rebels.
I immediately decided in my late father's favour to seek for legal and religious assistance for his soul to come to the United States.
I decided that I would seek for a widow and a childless orphanage in this country to be with my father in the hope of securing for him the best life possible.
I am seeking for the cooperation of the leading propagandists in Europe who are both now dead.
What I want you to do is to help me seek for assistance so that he can come to America to claim the life and property of this late President.
This proposal is highly confidential ,because I am not in a position to tell the truth.
There can be no secret of the fact that I am seeking assistance from all over Europe.
All I can hope for is for you to come forward and declare you are ready to assist me.
Before you come forward, please be assured that this proposal is highly confidential,because I am not in a position to tell the truth.
I believe that you will be most beneficial to me; I do not want any child to be the next to die in this manner.
I guarantee that this proposal will be of immense benefit to you.
I assure you that this proposal will not be fated for the sake of politics,but will serve as a constant reminder to all that is right about the United States of America.
I hope that you will consider this proposal as a very wise and simple regard to you.
I will be glad to know that you will be favouring me as you are.
Best Regards,
William M.B.U.Iuwe
