My name is Michael Bobert JEAN, I am a private consultant and security consultant to a European company. I am a private consultant of whom I have deposited around US$35,000,000,000.00 (EUR) with your company. I have also deposited this sum with a security company in Europe.
My company have a security company that is in Spain in charge of the money. This company was in the process of buying a new eighty-five million euro (US$15.6 million,000.00) house in the old city of Madrid Madrid.
The house was destroyed when a rebel group attacked the house. And the owner of the house died after being poisoned by the rebels.
The box that was planted with this box was official proof of ownership and the owner's identity. But the box was made in Russia and is still in the custody of the security company in Europe.
The box was destroyed by rebels who claimed to have stolen the box from a security company in Europe. But this claim is now being probed by the government in Europe who claim that they are following the law and that the box has no physical evidence to back up it.
Meanwhile, a lot of money was deposited in a foreign bank which was confiscated by the rebels and the boxes were later destroyed.
As the government is still in the custody of the country's security company in Europe, I have decided to move the money to a trust fund in Europe for safe keeping.
I am making this proposal to you because of the security risk involved in this transaction.
I am contacting you on your behalf to discuss the best course of action to take in this transaction.
I will want to declare that this transaction is an investment and I do not want to lose any money that I invest in this country.
The risk involved in investing in this country is not acceptable and this transaction is not for the money to be left to the rebels, but for the country to become prosperous again.
Therefore, this transaction is not for the sake of money, it is for security reasons and this risk is not acceptable to me.
Nevertheless, I am going to contact you to discuss with you your best course of action.
Best regards,
Michael Bobert JEAN
