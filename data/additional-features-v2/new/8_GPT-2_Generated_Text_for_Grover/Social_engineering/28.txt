There are no more than 20% of the total deposit due on an individual basis. I only want to use this money as a security measure to prevent any misappropriation of this money.
This amount will be used for all necessary expenses including real estate, so that the family can be kept in good health.
I am making this arrangement because of the positive response I have received from Europe. I am a widow of the late King Charles I, who died October 5, 2011. I am quite wealthy, I have eleven children and have five younger sisters. I was born into a rich family. During the war in My country, I lost over one million million (about US$21.3M) of my father's money.
My father died in the year 2000 due to alcoholism. However, his health deteriorated drastically. I decided to inherit all my father's money before the war. I got the help of my late husband who was the president of the Provinces of My Country in My country. He was a highly respected and respected man, and his son was a senior officer in the Security Forces of my Country.
During the war, my father was assassinated by the rebels led by General Sir Joseph Rotsdell, and was executed. He was also the only son of Sir Joseph Rotsdell who was a rebel leader. I became ill and died 20 years ago. My late husband was also an officer in the Security Forces of My Country.
I hope you will give me the assurance that I will not forget the last days of my life.

Dear Sir,
I am seeking your assistance to maintain the security and confidentiality of our correspondence. I am not afraid of death, and I do not fear death as much as I fear the death of my husband. Though I have been a very liberal person, I did not intend to be a tyrant, so I decided to share this money with my people and I hope to be rewarded. I do not want anyone to know about my story, but I am not afraid of death because I am a Christian and I know that life will be blessed in my husband's name.
I am Dr.MRS. MARRILLA.M.I.N.A.I am writing your letter so that you may understand how I got here. I am a very young widow. I was married for 20 years before I died by suicide. I have two children, one is a son and I have two of my late husbands.I always maintained that my husband was the only son of Sir Joseph Rotsdell who was a rebel leader who was killed by the rebels.
My late husband was a highly respected and respected man. He made me believe that the only man worthy of the office of President, that is why I decided to stand before the people of My Country with my husband, and seek a better life for myself and my family.
My late husband died on the 5th of May, 1946. I have always maintained that Sir Joseph Rotsdell was the true ruler of My Country. In fact, Sir Joseph Rotsdell was a highly respected person who proved himself to be the most reliable man in My Country, and the only one who ever worked for the Government of My Country. But before Sir Joseph Rotsdell died, I was told by one of my friends that Sir Joseph Rotsdell was dead. I took this information to my late husband who told me that he was going to give me back my late husband's money as a security measure to prevent any misappropriation of this money.
After Sir Joseph Rotsdell died, Sir Joseph Rotsdell was arrested and taken to an unknown location for execution. The chamber of the execution was found to contain the remains of Sir Joseph Rotsdell. I was an attorney with the Ministry of Justice. Sir Joseph Rotsdell was also a highly respected person who maintained that Sir Joseph Rotsdell was the true son of Sir Joseph Rots
