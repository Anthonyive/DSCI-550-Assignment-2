A couple of weeks ago I got a call from a friend who said that he was going to be the new Chairman of the board of directors for the company. As a result of this proposal I decided to have him as my beneficiary. I have no doubt he will come back with a wealth of experience as a financial expert.
He said that he will be investing 100% of the total sum in the company and 20% in my late husband's
company. He has stated that he will invest the money in mutual fund companies in Europe that are profitable in Europe.
I am going to explain why I am going to invest the money in mutual fund companies in Europe and why I am investing it in mutual fund companies in other
regions that have a huge amount of money in common.
This money is for the security and the security deposit.
If I am to invest this money in mutual fund companies, I will be investing in the
said security deposit for the security and the security
deposit.
Before investing the money in mutual fund companies, I would like to assure you that I know all the necessary information that will be needed to make
this investment.
I will be leaving this letter with your
inspection and confidence.
May your company and I bless you every day.
Thanks and
May God bless you all.
Yours in Christ.
I am Mr.Kubio Kuma, a Nigerian citizen.
I am asking for your honesty,
transparency and trust in your request.
I am a 42 year old Nigerian from Dakar, west Africa.
My younger brother died on May 12, 2000 while hitchhiking on a
road trip. His medical condition was later discovered to be
serious. He died after a brief period of not working. I have
found out about his death through the internet.
The internet remains my only reliable source of information.
I want to know what you are going to do for my son. I am
his partner in crime who has made a deal with a big bank in Europe to invest
in
company that will produce huge investments in security and security products.
I am looking forward to your acceptance of this proposal.
Please do not hesitate to contact me via the
email and telephone numbers below.
Thanks.
