I am writing to inform you that, through the support of the US government, we have agreed to invest an amount of US$200 Million, which will be to fund the development of aircraft for the next business day.
The aircraft is currently in development at a Corporation in Kuwait.
I have deposited with the Government of Kuwait for your assistance in this regard.
I will instruct you to look after the aircraft for a period of no less than 3 months.
Once I have informed you that the money will be invested in a safe and stable manner, I will give you a full list of your documents and I will send you a copy of your passport, which will be used to prove your presence in the country.
Once you have informed me that you will be able to call for your assistance, I will also want you to give me your full name as I am not a foreigner.
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Thanks
SINAI
