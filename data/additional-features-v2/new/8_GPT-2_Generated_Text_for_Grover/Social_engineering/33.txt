The Trump administration is accused of trying to undermine the independence of the Sudanese people by transferring the wealth of the former regime's treasury into a country not of the Sudanese people, which would be a war crime in its own right.
The president of Sudan is the son of former president Joseph Kony. He was assassinated by a mob of over 100,000 Sudanese rebels in the late late late 1990s.
It was the largest military coup in South Sudan's history, and in response, the President was overthrown by the rebels.
The rebels have since claimed the president's leadership and he is now trying to overthrow the president through military means.
In response to the Sudanese uprising, the rebels have lost all confidence in the president and he has decided to leave office, which is why he is keeping the money in a country not of the Sudanese people.
The president was a top economic officer for the Sudanese Government and he was arrested by the rebels in the late 1990s.
He has since been released from prison and is currently in good health.
Since his release, the rebels have secretly looted all his properties in East Africa.
The rebels have managed to transfer the wealth of the former regime's treasury into a country not of the Sudanese people, which would constitute a war crime in its own right.
It is estimated that over 200,000,000 US dollars ($200.000.000.00) is in a bank in East Africa, in a country not of the Sudanese people.
The rebels claim the government of President Omar al-Bashir as their leadership, members of the ruling party, and they have seized all the government properties in East Africa.
They claim a huge amount of money from all over the world for security reasons, including Africa, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe.
The rebels claim to have looted all the government properties in East Africa, which is why the president of Sudan is in need of urgent medical attention.

I am Dr. Daniel Sabin, a Sudanese Dr specializing in medicine and health, a highly respected doctor in politics, business, and finance.
I am writing to urge you to stand firm in opposing the rebel cause, because this war is going to be waged on the basis of lies, hatred, and the desire to destroy the Sudanese people.
To the rebels, the only legitimate country they have is Africa, as the capital of the Sudanese People.
The rebels are seeking the release of Mr. Omar al-Bashir from prison and then to claim the remaining 75% of his funds, which they want to invest in the Sudanese People.
The rebels are trying to seize all the government properties in East Africa to prevent the release of Mr. Omar al-Bashir and his family to Europe.

You have no idea of what a war will do to our people.
My father, I am the son of late President Joseph Kony.
I am a Sudanese refugee from Sudan who was killed in a civil war by rebels in the late late 1990s.
I was born in the war-torn country of Sudan, and my mother was one of the security forces killed in a civil war by the rebels in the late 1990s.
During the war, the rebels took over all of the government properties in East Africa, and after the rebels control the government, the rebels base their plans on the assumption that the rebels can seize all the political, economic, and military properties in East Africa, thus it is the only way they can hold on to the remaining 75% of the fund.
Now, I am making this proposal as a child who was a victim of the civil war.
