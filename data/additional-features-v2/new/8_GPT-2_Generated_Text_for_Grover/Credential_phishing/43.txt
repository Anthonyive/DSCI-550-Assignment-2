The original source for this article was discovered by an anonymous member of the company who is not a member of pom.org. I decided to share it with you so that you can understand what i'm talking about.

This was my 3rd attempt at contacting the company, and I had decided to give the whole process up for review, since they don't want any money involved in this transaction.
This is because the original supplier of the original list of names is now no longer on the company's payroll.
Since the original list was discovered by the company, I decided to share this information with you, since the company won't tell me, and I want you to understand that it is a huge deal for the company.
The original names of the company are now being transferred to a foreign company, which is being investigated by the government and the foreign company officials for its involvement in this transaction.
This information is for the benefit of the company and the company's management, as this is not a risk to the company due to the fact that the original names of the company were transferred to foreign companies before this transaction.
The net result is that the company will not be able to meet the payment of the original funds and the company will be unable to provide for the expenses incurred by the company in this transaction.
So, I decided to share this information with you to help the company to better understand the situation.
Its not easy to find the original source for this article, but I have no other choice other than to contact the original source for this article. I want to make sure that this information is reliable and that it is legitimate. I want you to understand that we are not living in a free world, and this information is for the benefit of the company and the company's management.
This is because the original supplier of the original lists of names was still on the company's payroll. The original company officials decided that the original names of the company are not allowed to be transferred to foreign companies until the company receives reliable information that the original names are not allowed to be transferred to foreign companies.
This business is very profitable, since the original company officials decided to give the company the money for its transfer. Since the original company officials don't want any money involved in this transaction, the company will not be able to meet the payment of the original funds and the company will be unable to provide for the expenses incurred by the company in this transaction.
You will not be able to tell my colleagues and I the truth as to who is behind this transaction; I want to help you to understand this business better, since the original company officials are no longer on payroll.
