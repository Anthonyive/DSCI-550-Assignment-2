U.S. Senator Al Franken said on Saturday that his country could not accept that the United States Government is involved in the murder of his daughter, orphanaged Ukrainian immigrant Ulyan Borodai.

The death of Ulyan came as a surprise to the whole of the world.
Ulyan was the only child of a pro-Russian prime minister who died in a plane crash in the hands of rebels in eastern Ukraine.
President Vladimir Putin called the death a 'disgrace' and said he will not betray his country. The president also said he will not betray the confidence of the United Nations Security Council.
He said the death may not be a surprise but it is a total shock to him because he has never before been in this role.

The farm that Ulyan was selling to his father is now to be used for settlement in the country. It is a place for children of foreign origin and for open communication.
The minister of treasury for finance and real estate, the minister of education and the minister of health have decided to transfer this fund to another account. This is necessary to further the fund's end of life.
Ulyan's father died in the bomb blast accident that claimed his life. The bank account for this fund will be transferred to the account of the department of development and development, the minister of health and the minister of the treasury for finance and real estate. This fund will be used for personal, banking, civil and political purposes only.
