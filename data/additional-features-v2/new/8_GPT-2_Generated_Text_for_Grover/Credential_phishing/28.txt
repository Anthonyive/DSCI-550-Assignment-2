I am a professional software developer with an interest in the internet industry, but my main interest is in a project that will be executed in the US. I have decided to invest in various funds (US$5,000,000.00) to fund my next project - Internet Relay. The funds will be used to fund a business in the US, and I would like to receive your honest responses to this proposal. We have been negotiating the terms of our partnership for some time, but the US government and the search companies have not been able to arrive at a satisfactory settlement, so we are ready to start compromising the terms of our partnership. I am asking to invest in the fund to be used to fund the company. Please, I am asking for your honest response to this proposal. I am contacting you to make a contract, and I want to hear from you soon enough so that I can contact the company officer who is the head of the US Federal search and rescue agency. I want you to help me. I will never accept a contract, and I am going to be paid around US$5,000,000.00, but I will not be assigned to the search and rescue department because the contract has expired, and I do not want the job to end with me being the manager. I have been informed that you will not be given the contract, so I want you to take your share, and I want to hear from you within 7 days of the end of weizing. I have procedures to follow to be honest to you and reliable in the execution of the contract so that you can contact me immediately to get your reply. I will not give you a contract because you will not be assigned to the search and rescue department. But if you are willing to assist me in this transaction, I want you to know that I am not a lawyer, I am just a former official of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) who was the original owner of the original US Government documents and documents. I have had no dealings with any Government official who has these documents in his possession for all these years. I am confident that you will not be the ones who are going to be the real beneficiaries.  I want you to keep the following in mind when I send you this proposal: 1. I want you to be honest, trustworthy, and trustworthy, and to give me confidence in your ability to make the deal work, and you can use this money to help me get back to the US and in the future transfer the funds to my account in your country. 2.
