-I am the president of the Bank of France (BFR).
My colleagues and I have decided to invest this sum of $10M,000,000.00(US$12M,000,000.00) in the new Investment Bank of France (BFR) in the country of our choice, with the intention of 
immediately opening a new investment bank, with the proceeds 
invested in stocks and real estate in the country where the funds were originally 
invested. We are just over a month into the project. Most of the money was lost in a crash in 1999. We have decided to 
immediately start the process of re-investing the money in a new investment bank.
The banks are operated by our nominated officials from the banking industry and all the 
businesses involved are now in a state of total co-operation with our central bank, which will 
expect us to invest the funds to a fund in the country of our choice where the money will 
be re-invested.
The funds will be used for the various investment projects that we are currently proposing to do in the country of our choice.
This fund will be used to buy  crops, etc. and the cost of the investment is paid in 
the end through the banks accounts we have in the country of our choice for the 
investment. We are in the process of transferring all the funds to a new account in the 
banking sector. All the money will be used for the investment.
The proposal to us is that the money will be given to you in the form of 
a security deposit for the purpose of any repayment of the funds.
The money will be equal to about US$10M,000,00.00, which we used for the purchase of a new 
car. We are going to give you the full name of the bank and the account where the funds were originally 
invested. We are going to give you the amount of the money and the account where the funds were originally 
invested. The funds will be paid to you through the accounts of the bank that 
we are in the process of transferring to your bank account.
You are free to accept this proposal to your bank account at any time, but please be aware that the claims that you have 
made on this proposal are only for the purpose of making known to the banking 
system that you are a foreign with no other bank account in your country, as this 
proposal will have to be abandoned and we will need to pay you 
for your part. We are working very hard to make this transaction as smooth as possible, so that you 
will not be disturbed by this transaction. But please note that we intend to invest this 
fund in a bank that will handle  the necessary balance transfer payments and in which 
you will be allowed to operate.
We are very interested in hearing from you.
Thanks for your prompt response.
Mr.Sareen Suwani.
Abu Rumayra.
