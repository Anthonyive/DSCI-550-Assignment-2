My partner and I...
My partner and I are from Yemen, we are the prime contractors and we have all the necessary documents to use in this transaction.
Before I get into the details of the transaction, I must firstly explain that I am a married man with an established relationship with my partner and I want to share with you what we discovered in the past months. I am a married individual who does not have any children. I am the sole beneficiary of the contract in question on behalf of a foreign company.
We were given the money to send to a foreign bank account for investment purposes. Since we are not married nor have any children, the money is still in our custody so I am very concerned about the consequences of this transaction.
I am the contractor and the country manager of the contract the project. I have been involved in all the various management and policy approvals that have been put before us. We have also been told by the contractor that the money will be in the bank account of the foreign company where we will be paid.
We are now in the process of going through all the various security measures that have been put in place before us. It is God's will that all the above mentioned risks be taken into account, hence we are going through all the steps to get the money into your account.
I have discovered that many foreign companies that offer to transfer money to you or your partner can be highly profitable. Since the funds are being transferred over to your partner's account, we are in a huge banking crisis in the country. We are now in a huge risk situation as the total amount of the transfer is not in your country, US dollars. This is why I am going through everything to get the funds into your account.
The government in that country is also banking on the money and we have decided to transfer over the money to another bank account that will handle the money.
We are going to give you the opportunity to invest in this country that will provide you with a better future. We need your help to get this money into your hands and we need to hear from you soon enough.
Before we head out into the field of business, I know that you are going to be very interested in the information we have about you. If you are willing to assist us in this transaction, we will give you the opportunity to invest in this country.
I guarantee that your assistance will enable us to finally get this money into your hands. I want you to know that it is easy to be a contractor and to have your partner as the sole beneficiary of this money. I don't want you having to worry too much about this transaction because your partner is the only beneficiary of this money.
I want you to know that this transaction has been completely transparent to us. We are not allowed to disclose foreign bank accounts or any other sensitive information to foreign banks and we are in a position to transfer the money to your partner's account. You should really be the one that receives the money and give it to us. We are not allowed to share this money with any foreign partner. We can't have this money for any reason.
I want you to know that this is an investment transaction and we don't want anyone to know about it because of the secrecy of the matter. We are just people with no business to do, but we are going to do this to get this money out of evil hands. We don't want the middleman to know about it.
Please, take this matter into your own hands.
Sincerely,
Yours faithfully.
Yours faithfully.
Regards.
