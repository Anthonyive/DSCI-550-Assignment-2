I got an email from a company that does business in the country where I worked.
I want to share this information to my colleagues and colleagues in the Foreign Service and it belongs to you.
I am Yvonne Bivakova from Yemen.
I am a member of a 20-man delegation that accompanied Iyero to the United States for the first time. I was the only foreigner in the delegation. I got into an argument with Mr. Iyero who was a member of the delegation but the situation involved in this matter does not give him hope of finding a reliable person to handle this situation.
Mr. Iyero has a very good and trustworthy person. I gave him the number of my company which I am required to transfer back to my company.
I have been working in a private attorney's office in the capital and I am still waiting for his response. I have to ask that you not let this person get in your country and that his name be removed from my company name.
I am writing you as a foreigner in order to protect you. As I mentioned above, we are in a foreign country and we have never met before.
I met with Mr. Iyero about a week ago and I was wondering if any of the other foreign officials in the delegation would be willing to assist me.
My question is that you do not want any foreign officials in your company to receive your funds.
I have explained to him that a foreign person is not fully trustworthy in this business. He told me that the government does not want you to make any huge payments to this company and that if you don't cooperate with the government, you will be put in a position to receive the money, so that you will not have any part to play in the transaction.
Now I am in need of a reliable person to handle this transaction. I want you to keep this information confidential and that you will not put anything in your company's name. I hope that you are willing to come up with a confidential arrangement to fund this transaction.
I am contacting you to assist me in the transfer of your company funds to your account. My client is a member of the delegation and his name is Beji, a member of the delegation. I am not sure if he will be ok with taking my money and I hope that he won't.
I want you to be the one to forget about this matter. I want to be able to have this transaction and this money with my country and let this person be my partner. I want you to be able to handle this transaction and that you will not put anything in your company's name. I want to protect you from any possible risk.
I want to hear from you. Your company name and your company's telephone and fax numbers are included in the transaction. We both want to know about this transaction and what your company's transaction will be like.
Thank you very much.
