The news that my wife and I are going to the hospital for a week-long as a result of a serious illness, we decided to go on a business trip to see our daughter, who is very much alive.Now, all the details are being discussed with my wife and with the security company in your country. I will be expecting your best regards in the next of kin for your assistance and help to pass on to your next of kin for your assistance.
I have been informed that you may want to invest your money into a trust so that the trust will be made safe for your account. My wife and myself are not aware that the trust is still in place and would be very interested in your assistance.
My wife and I have been married for over 10 years and the only thing that has kept our relationship from going into trouble is the fact that we have been married for a long time now, when we got married in London, but we both had very good lives. Our husbands died in a plane crash and many of us were in the hospital with our husbands.
We are still in a very good health in the hospital and we are going to be closely monitored for next of kin and for any connected financial transaction.
We are in the process of leaving and will get back to you by the day of the hospitalization. I will provide you with as much information as we need to make your transaction as happy as possible, but we will be able to share the money as soon as it is safe to do so.
