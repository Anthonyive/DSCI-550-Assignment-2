US$ 100,000.00
In the amount of US$100,000.00
Thrilled to share this amount with you with the benefit of my involvement in this business, I am looking for a person who has the necessary funds to enable me to invest this money in an acceptable company, and who will be willing to assist me in the process of obtaining this money. I would like to start a business in the United States, through which I may receive this money. I have no other choice but to seek for a foreign partner who will assist me in the process of securing a reliable partner. We are currently in discussions with an investment company in which I will invest the money, but we are still waiting to hear from you.
I am the CEO of an investment company in which my company has been awarded the contract to operate the transfer of the money to a foreign account.
The company claims the fund to be non-monetary, and I am presently in a position to establish a safe haven for the money.
My company has been placed under a trust by its foreign partner, who is the president of the company. The company's share in the fund was approximately US$10.1 million, but we are now seeking to transfer it to a foreign account. I will explain further why I am not interested in a foreign partner, and I intend to contact you to assist me in this transaction.
I am not a foreigner, and I am not a foreigner to this business, hence please do not contact me if you are not familiar with this business.
I am a government official who is a member of the Central Bank of the Iraqi Government, which is in charge of the supply of fuel oil to the Iraqi Government. The government has declared its intention to nominate a foreign investment fund (foreign direct investment) that will be used to fund our accounts. We are awaiting your response to this email.
Due to the nature of our business, this is the only possible opportunity to claim the fund and claim the fund as our own within our contract with the government of Iraq. We cannot claim the fund for any purpose other than to provide for our business partners or to pay the dividend that we receive from the fund.
We have since used the funds to purchase used car and home furnishings that we need for our business. We are presently in the process of receiving the newly paid bills for the money.
I am awaiting your response to this email.
