Before my and my colleagues, we had mentioned the need for a free trial of the service, as your service is the only way we can get into the lead. However, since the end of the war, we have lost the confidence of the Afghan government in us, and we are now going to seek a business partner who will be willing to give us a huge sum of money to enable us to operate the service.
On the 10th of July I and my colleagues were informed that in the event of an emergency, the company will be liquidated. We decided to start the business from scratch, as our company never really got into the business of the service.
So, while I was away, the company decided to liquidate all the funds and claims before the execution of the service, on a plan to be executed by the next of kin of the deceased.
The plan was to transfer some of our savings to a private company they will use as the account for the company we will operate and pay the bills.
I have decided to write to you to assist in the transfer of this money to your account, since I have no other choice but to do so myself.
This is a proposal from the former contractor, who claims the funds as his own. He, along with his partner, have been working on the project for three years now, and I have decided to stand as the beneficiary of the money. We decided to go for the life of the man until the end of the project, and since we have been in the business of the service for so long, we decided to offer you a 60% share of the money which you will receive.
If you want to help us in this transaction, that is fine as long as you will not betray us. I also want you to give us your full name, and/or your contact information, so that we can share the money.
I want to sincerely thank you for your cooperation.
Sincerely,
Besch
