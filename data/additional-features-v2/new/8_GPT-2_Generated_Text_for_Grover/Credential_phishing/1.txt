I had some trouble getting my job out of the bank because the bank had stopped being a reliable member. They sent me a note that said I must pay the bank 60% of the amount. It's not hard to prove that you are the person behind the money, and that you are not a member of this country, but I am very sorry.
I have to give this note the confidence that it will not come back to me. I have no idea who the person is but I am certain that this is a scam.
I am so sorry for the trouble. I hope that you will not disappoint me.
I will be contacting the bank first and I will nominate the person who will do this for me. I want you to go ahead and make the payment for me. I will also send you the money in a bank account that will be used for this transaction. Please, don't be afraid. I want you to be a part of this.
I will not give you any secret. I want you to understand that I am very grateful to you for your cooperation. I hope that you will not give me any trouble again.
I am the only person working in the bank in this country. I had no idea that I had this money and now I know that I have to pay the bank 60% of the amount. I can't do it as a foreigner, however I want to know if you will help me to get into the bank. I want you to be a part of this.
I am trying to get in contact with one of my colleagues and he is going to the bank to transfer it into his account. I will call him in person and we will see if he can help us to transfer the money into his account. I know that the bank is not going to be easy to get your help in this transaction. I want you to know that this is not just a financial matter. It is also a personal matter and I want you to know that I will not let this deal go by without my best efforts. I want you to be as reliable as possible.
I am certain that the money will be transferred to the account of your choice because the bank has stopped being a reliable member. I will not let you down. I want you to be a part of this.
Please, don't hesitate to reach me through my email address to tell me who you are. I want to hear from you soon. In the end, I will send you the money, i.e. 60% of the amount. A 20% interest will be paid to the bank for the transfer of the money into your account. I will give you the name of the person who will do this for you. I want to hear from you soon enough. I want to hear from you about this bank transaction, so that you can share in the success I soya have in this business.
Thank you so much and I look forward to seeing you soon.
Best regards,
Ricardo Santos

Dear Sir,
I am writing to share my feelings about this particular transaction. The information I had on the airdate was from a reliable person who had the money transferred to his bank account in my country.
Now, let me start by saying that I am very grateful for your assistance in this matter. I have no doubt that very soon this money will be transferred to your account. It is safe to say that this transaction will be successful and this money will be in your company.
Before the transfer, my boss, Mr. Carlos Soto, gave me the following information. He said that the money would be put to the liquidation in my country. I had been a member of the Bank of the Republic of South America (BRA) since the civil war. There is a transfer being planned for the transfer of this money into your account that will allow it to be transferred into your account. It is necessary to confirm the transfer by contacting me by my email address and the phone number for the transfer. All that is required is for you to make your account your bank account. I will give you a brief description of the account.
I am Mr. Carlos Soto of the Bank of the Republic of South America (BRA) in the country of my first name. I have met with the president of my country before, but the president has told me that he does not give me the necessary information to make this transaction work for him. I am going to nominate you to be the beneficiary of the money deposited with the bank. You will contribute 50% of the total sum to the fund of this account, which will be used for my education and other expenses, as well as to pay the expenses that are involved in transferring this money into your account. I will give you 30% of the total amount and you will be paid 70% of the total sum.
I want you to give me your last name and address so that I can assist you in the transfer. I
