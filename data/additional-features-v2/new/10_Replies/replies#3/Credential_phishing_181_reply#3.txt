Hello, Why would you need those information from me?tion from me? I don't want to know what's out there about you or what your life is like before I make you one of my clients. I am a registered psychologist, and it is your job to see whether you are OK with it, and to assess what is good and bad about you.


If you are not on the level of a therapist with a different set of beliefs or ideas, it does not matter how strong that person may be. I don't care if you are going in the direction of my goals or my opinions. You need to be yourself to be successful. You are welcome on your own terms. Just remember that you did not want to be an asshole to someone else, and that I'm not that person. This is just your business to help you grow.


To learn more about what I've done to make myself what I am, read the testimonials from Dr. John Babbitt and her website<|endoftext|>
