YoStop sending me requests for my account so early!unt so early!

When do we start using YoStop?

YoStop is open-source and free. We provide software for everyone to use, without any limitations.

You can try out our free YoStop account.

Why is YoStop on Android?

YoStop has more features than the others. First of all, you can use YoStop to interact with your apps at your choice, from the touch of a button. Second, YoStop helps you to choose whether to send you messages or use other programs. Thirdly, YoStop help you to connect with other users, to share some interesting social experiences, and to improve your apps.

What do I need to do to use YoStop?

YoStop offers a great interface (and a very great way to interact with other users!), all built in to your iOS or Android devices. You can connect to the YoStop account just like any other user and use other features. But, before you start, you also need to understand what you're doing with YoStop.

If you are an iOS or Android user, then YoStop is more than just a chat app. It has your own chat application which will also work with the YoStop iOS or Android software. You can join a group or group of users and have them talk to you about various issues, from new features to customizations.
