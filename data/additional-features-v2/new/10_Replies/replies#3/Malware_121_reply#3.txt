I just don't feel like posting more than once (or perhaps once with multiple posts). If I do post more than one topic as a submission to the site, I will respond to it directly. If I post two articles of the same subject, they will each be covered as multiple submissions. Otherwise, I will try to focus on one subject at a time rather than post each article once. If I don't feel like posting multiple stories to the same subject, I will try to answer that one question first and reply, if any. However, if a user does post more than one topic on the same topic as a submission, that user is also marked as one with a message and not for that subject. This is because I do not want to discourage users from sharing information about me. Rather, I want to help you find the right person for the job I'm currently in, and ensure that you know exactly what kind of person I am.

This is the third-largest, most popular page of all time. I've collected thousands of comments, hundreds of photos, and even a number of links to other people
