Hey,Stop sending message to this email address or I'll call the cops!all the cops!

Hi, It's Miguel.

I'm Mafioso Bocno, an attorney from Santa Rosa who's been documenting what happened to my father when he was born with an X in his chest. I'm a reporter for San Joaquin County, and it has been a very difficult time for me.

My dad's been in hospital for more than a year. He lost all of his limbs and was dying. He did not respond to treatment. I was still at home when my father was diagnosed with acute leukemia. I called my wife, so we could meet up.

On my way to meet up, Miguel was waiting at a nearby pharmacy for a package to arrive. He had already opened it. He had the medication I'd ordered.

Miguel is a 22-year-old medical student. He went to school in the San Joaquin County Jail to be a physician. He had a bad experience.

After he and I both took a leave of absence, he was given an emergency stay of 72 hours. He spent it in a hospital, where he was given antibiotics and he had trouble eating.

I had called him a day after the first of the week because I wanted him to get better. He didn't respond. I called them a few days later. On his own, I thought he was the only patient at the hospital who didn't get better.

Now, two months later, with a new medical director on standby, he's back at the hospital.

Now, Miguel's been in the hospital for about two weeks. He's still recovering. His condition is so bad that he's been confined to the ICU, which is like a "super bed" with a metal cage. He's so weak that no medication can do a whole lot for him.

So, why is his health so bad?

His blood pressure is very low and he's had numerous seizures. His stomach, as well as his kidneys, have been affected severely, and his heart has taken a beating. And, I was unable to take his blood pressure. He wasn't able to breath. It has been in the hospital for days. It's just so bad. My father was diagnosed in the IC
