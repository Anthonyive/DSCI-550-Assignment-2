Hi, I don't have my own computer, could you buy me one?, they will try to find ways to fix the issues that are plaguing the US economy by making the money available for American companies and investors. The problem isn't that the government isn't doing the right thing with the money, it's that there is an underlying assumption that the US government is being the victim.
US laws are designed to ensure that foreign governments get the benefit of their money. When I was the Deputy Under Secretary in charge of international affairs, we came across a lot of people saying, that in the world of foreign companies, it's better for foreign government to make money where the law is clear and it is good for the local government, and there is no discrimination.
And what you would say, if you're going to a foreign government that can make money, and it can give it money that doesn't necessarily be good for your local economy, the law says that that is fine. It isn't necessarily a discrimination case. There can be a lot of money coming in and out. What you could do is make a lot of money if you have it that you can get out of.<|endoftext|>
