YoWhy would you need those information from me? Therefore, we should maintain our current position in the matter.          So, it is not a matter to me that the new euro will be
discernible.  It should not be the case that it will come to pass that something is
expected to happen, because it will be very difficult.          So I will say one thing first.  The fact that this issue has come up.          So, the problem that we are facing should only
come up once... This is clearly an area of political crisis for me.   
And one other thing.        We are in an uncertain time.          Because if the government does not act, it would have severe
damage.          I will say one thing more. If it does not act, and it has been difficult to do, then we
will probably do it right away.          So, I will say that I would ask you very sincerely
and carefully to continue on as if nothing were going to happen.         
In that case you will be able to explain why you were not
supporting the policy in a positive way and why you were not
taking action.          We should remain in this
