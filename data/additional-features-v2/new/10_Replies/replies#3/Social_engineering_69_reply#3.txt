To whom may concern, Do you really think I would believe in this trash? this incident? It seems you really should ask someone who would know the people and who can provide information to help this person. Do you know who came here with you and what they were doing in the process? That is important. That person is a well-known person here. And my question was, is there anything else they need to tell us about this incident, so that you might understand our concerns and take actions? Thank you, MP
One day, I received an email which said "The Prime Minister is here, this is the man who brought this incident to an end" and said that he has also written to the people and we are working together on the investigation.  I will send him the contents of the email as soon as possible. I have now received this letter. I have received this letter from the Foreign Ministry on Saturday 1 May 2014. I am quite happy because I was the MP who sent it as well. There are three members of the ministry, both of the Liberal Party, who want this person to call. I said I am not afraid, my message to the Prime Minister was clear and not under any pressure whatsoever, there are no exceptions for these people and I do not have any plans to contact you at this time.<|endoftext|>
