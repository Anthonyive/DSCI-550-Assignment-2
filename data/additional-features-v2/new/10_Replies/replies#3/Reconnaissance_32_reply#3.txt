Dear, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks!tion? Thanks!

My problem is that I can't do this, because I need my money back. However, I am in Canada and paying my bills on time; so my money is not the issue. Will you assist me? Please.

Sincerely,

Re-read the above question. I can't understand why there is such a difference in the amount of money sent to Canada each year.


However, please do not assume that we can't get rid of our bills any time soon. I am paying my bills all day, with no one to check it.

I hope this helps.

Good luck.<|endoftext|>
