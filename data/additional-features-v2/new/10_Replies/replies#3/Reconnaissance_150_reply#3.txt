YoI don't know.  don't know.  I think I am a bit into making some super cute toys.  The toy I have always wanted was from my old high school girl who I've met and love...
The toy I am making is this super adorable toy from My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic.
I took a look and the thing looks good, but in all honesty, is a little wobbly and I have a problem with the edges.  The "wobble" and the "wobbly" edges are annoying but I really believe they are to give a little sparkle to your favorite toy or to give that little sparkle that makes a wonderful part of the experience.  I also think it is way too small for the size of my cup, so I will be trying a larger cup.
Thanks for helping me to get things done, we both love them!!<|endoftext|>
