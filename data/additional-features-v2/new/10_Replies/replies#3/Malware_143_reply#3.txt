Dear, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! United States.

Your mom never married, nor did she ever own an estate. She was a good father, a strong husband, and loyal husband to her children.

Your grandmother's family was a close friend to her.

Your father, a well respected local lawyer, had some very important business to attend to. The daughter had a son named J.

Your mother wanted to live in the United States but was too afraid to do so. After a very long wait in the United States, your father got a job that gave him the opportunity to make that living.

Your father, an accomplished businessman, has been a hero to your grandmother's people, and has even helped them get their own way in many ways.

Your sister grew up to be an important member of your father's family. She is well-adjusted, and was even offered a job working for a foreign company.

Your father was a great person to have at his service. Your mother, in her final days, died from a small heart attack. You both married in the same neighborhood. Both have close family connections and some important businesses, such as a bakery, a restaurant, a hospital, a hospital-acquisition and insurance company.
