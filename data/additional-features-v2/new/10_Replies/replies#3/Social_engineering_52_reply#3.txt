Dear, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks!tion? Thanks!

As with any payment, please write back if this was not a good idea in the last 24 hours.

I am from the UK who is not on the list of international account holders and my identity information is the same as your passport. Do not send me another confirmation email unless you tell me to do so.

What will we be doing if I send you a "Check Card"? Do you like that?

We will keep the check from what we consider to be safe to receive when I return from Europe. We will not store or forward information as it may contain information which might be a breach of privacy which may be subject to legal action. We will hold you responsible for any risks of loss or damage you may incur as a result of providing or receiving the requested information.

I purchased an item via the internet and my phone number is listed in my address book as a "Cable". Is it safe to send me a check card with my name and address if I am not a "Cable"?

Yes, the address can also be a "Cable Card" - this card can be charged based on your activity - but there are no guarantees that you will be able to use the "Cable Card" to purchase items from stores outside of UK and will be charged when you use our services as a cable operator. In some cases there is no way to know what the card will be issued for
