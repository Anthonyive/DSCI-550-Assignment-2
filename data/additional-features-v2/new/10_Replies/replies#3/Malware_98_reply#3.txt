To whom may concern, Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. have money I would leave him and he always said that I did not have that much. My daughter is still trying and she is trying to figure this out. I do not give my children much money because I am so sad to have their mother go out and kill them to pay for this bullshit. It's so frustrating to hear that. I love him and am happy that my money is safe. but also that you cannot live it forever. He said that you have to get your money, but he said that you must keep it safe. We had a great time and he said that we are working together and we will do everything we can to work together to keep your family.<|endoftext|>
