Hello, Stop sending message to this email address or I'll call the cops!.

In January 2011, Reuters reported that a Nigerian man has been arrested over the alleged tax evasion of two women. The investigation is still ongoing and the country is struggling to come to an understanding. Does this leave the current investigation with no future?

I think the current situation is very tragic for the people of the country, but there is also the possibility that the country will not survive. If there is not a solution then we are also dependent on another people. It's too early to say whether the future will be good or bad, but at the end of the day we need a real solution that addresses the economic problem, and I believe we have to take the necessary actions. If the current investigation does not lead to an end to the tax evasion issue, then we will get off this continent of ours. It is not only our problem, it is for the people who live in Nigeria and the future of our country is more important than the current situation. It is time to stop hiding, stop living under an oppressive regime and wake up to the reality about our country that is going on.

Is there an easy way to make your own money?
