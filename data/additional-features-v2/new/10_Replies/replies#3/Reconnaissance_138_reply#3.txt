Hey,Do you really think I would believe in this trash?n this trash?  I do not think that would be fair.  The only thing I would do differently now would be to find a job with other people.  My job is to make the world a better place.  This has worked out beautifully for me.  I have a pretty good background, so I would expect to make money off of it (if I had no other choices and would have tried to save money if I wanted to.  You know how I always say that I'm a professional,  and I do not?  This is not the case!  I do not have a "job" and my life is a whole lot more work than it was when I last worked at the shop.  I would probably do a better job making more money, but I'm not too sure how to make a good life for myself or the community I serve.
So, before you go on that crazy rant about stealing goods, I want to give you two specific advice I've read that is both valid and necessary to stay on my course and do what I'm doing.
If you want a job, let me know.  You know that I am going to teach you how to be a good father to your daughter.  You also know that even if you didn't make it that far (at least financially), you could still have some decent food to go around.  This is what I told the man named Mark: I would put you in charge.  I wouldn't make mistakes (other than the ones I have made myself as a father.  I didn't know what to do), you know that.  I wouldn't be running my business in a way that got my son or daughter kicked out of school for
