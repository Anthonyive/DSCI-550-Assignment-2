Dear, I can't understand what you mean by thatIf you have a situation like this, it's not a big deal, but if you have some people involved in some other criminal investigation, it can also be a big deal. It can be a big deal for us, we've done that, we've covered it. So in all kinds of situations, you have to take into account all of those facts on your side of the equation. If you have been charged with a crime, the government will never make you pay. This is just the kind of situation we've experienced. I think we've done better than our public comments would suggest."<|endoftext|>
