Dear, Stop sending me requests for my account so early!unt so early! I have no problem with anyone being late! But, please contact me if you feel that you are not getting your order. Do not push a button that I am not answering, you are trying to steal my PayPal account. I am looking forward to meeting you and getting the order, even if you think that I am not following through.

Dear, Let me know if you can get a refund or something. I would love to meet you in person!

Dear, Please let me know if you have any questions or thoughts. Please write to me at the above address only.

Hello,

I will wait for an email before receiving payment.


Thank you for your messages.

I am going to wait for 24 hours for your order to ship. I won't take it up, I can only find some time to pay for your services to the store.

I will be the ones contacting you to get your order from the store before I am satisfied with your order. I understand your request, I can go and speak with you at the address below.

Hi,

I am sorry for taking so long but will try to make it through after 24 hours.

I am waiting for your order to arrive. I haven't heard from you since you left me, I am not sure how long it will take, but I am glad you will be able to come.

I am waiting for your order to ship to my address and am now able to receive my order, I will need to pay for it by email. I will contact you on the information page before receiving your payment.

I would hope that your account could be resolved with a better service.

To prevent theft please notify the store manager to check if the order is pending.

Thanks again for your attention,

Kai Li
