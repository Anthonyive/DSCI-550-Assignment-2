Hello, I've located your ip address. your wife, and your four children together.  But I also have to admit that all this, and the time you spent at home with my mum and dad, and my sister and my cousin, would feel a little strange for you.
So, now I tell you this...  I went to a little family home where you could go out with a friend at the time and it was like a home away...
You are young, and just coming off such a wonderful time.  You are beautiful, and you look so sweet. And you also look like one of those women from your native England who would play and sing with a choir. So why did I say you were young?  Because I said that it would be difficult for us to have kids at home...
It's so important.  You will always be your mother.  All this is for your own good, and nothing could be further from my mind.
You're very understanding in how you are acting.  I will never accept you acting like you are in order to be successful.
I understand what you are saying, right?  Well, I understand what you are trying to say, and there is no point in trying to change your beliefs
