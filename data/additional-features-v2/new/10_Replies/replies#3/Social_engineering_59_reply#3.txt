Hello, Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. U.S.-based unilateral intervention in North Korea since the late '80s, only to get bogged down in an escalating diplomatic spat with China.

Yglesias also reported that the U.S. will be purchasing $1.3 billion in arms to counter China's efforts to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile, a weapon that could strike the homeland of the U.S. We could be spending nearly $500 billion more over the next five years if, as reports suggest, China develops such a weapon, according to a senior administration official.

It is not clear what happens to the $500 billion or less figure that Obama was promised from September 2013 to 2018, but we will likely have a very different answer when it comes to dealing with the United States, because the U.S. has no international troops to deal with and will just have to find another foreign source to help train our own military.

That is, it is unlikely we would be able to hit a massive new missile defense system in a short time, though at the very least it would be much faster than any existing system in the world.

So let's get a real look at what we have in place to deal with China's military aggression.
