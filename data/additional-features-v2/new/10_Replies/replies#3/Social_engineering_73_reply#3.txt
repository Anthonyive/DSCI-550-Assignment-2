Hi, I've located your ip address.r ip address. I can't help it...

I can't help it...

Why do you think your username will appear as #2 if you connect with an IP address and a computer name? Why doesn't the name of the Internet address you are connected with actually appear in your ip address? Also, there is only one computer in the room.

Why do you think you'll see the text "0xb000008" as part of your login prompt? Why don't the white letters appear on your login prompt instead?<|endoftext|>
