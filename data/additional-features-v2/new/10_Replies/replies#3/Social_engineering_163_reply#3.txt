Dear, Stop sending me requests for my account so early!unt so early! I only receive my first email, about 2-3 weeks later (after a few days), I have no intention of leaving or going back. Thank you for your effort to keep me informed about upcoming events! I know that my account cannot be accepted until late September, and I can only get a call once per week from the phone number. I am not a subscriber, but I do like your work, and so would like to help you. As soon as I get to the last day on my account, I will email you a contact number and send an email. You will receive an e-mail from me with information about my location and all relevant requirements that must be met, so please be aware of this. Thanks!<|endoftext|>
