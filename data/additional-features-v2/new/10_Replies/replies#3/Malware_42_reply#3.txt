I agree that my use of the online shopping portal provided by Paypal makes it difficult for me to obtain payments. However, I will be happy to return any payment and that I can contact any merchant and ask them to do me an additional investigation.

I did not use Paypal at the time I was using Paypal, and I have taken steps to remove any fraud. However, if I have received additional information about the use of my credit card and its details, I have taken steps to resolve this issue. The information provided to me regarding my payment is inaccurate in nature and I want to provide an accurate description of how this information was provided and I have taken steps to prevent fraud.

The following financial information is provided by Paypal for the purposes of making decisions about the use of my payment, including details on the transactions that would occur when I used Paypal. If you need additional information regarding an order, or information about transactions that are not required by law, please contact Paypal directly and we can verify that the information is correct and that it is provided from the original
