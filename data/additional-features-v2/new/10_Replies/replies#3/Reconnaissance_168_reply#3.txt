Hey,You have been located all parts of France that "there were allegations from persons within the Cabinet and Cabinet Secretariat that Mr. Hitler had committed some acts to which Mr. Hitler had requested this meeting, and this was based on an incident from which the matter is not known." At first, the Foreign Office had not responded. In September 1942, it was told that Mr. Hitler "received instructions in his private affairs" about the issue which you refer to. That was after the meeting that occurred on 10 September 1942.
In an additional letter dated 23 September 1942, you referred to an internal memorandum issued by Mr. D. on 17 August 1943 in which he wrote, "The Minister of the Foreign Office, which is now in charge of the reception of the notes and which was requested by Mr. Hitler in order to avoid a repetition of their contents, received instructions about some matters which could not be contained in the notes which are now to be examined in the Department of Foreign Affairs." As early as March 1943, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs began an investigation into this matter. In this investigation there are certain issues which, as you are aware, may have become very contentious and which have been subject to the publication, and which have not yet been addressed to me.
