To whom may concern, Your computer has been hacked. been hacked. But why? The computer used to download all of The Sims 3 files and play them is different. It had all the files from a previous install, so it was likely to be corrupted, according to its original owner, Mike Krahn. He wrote about it in his blog post.


The mod, called "Brick" as well as "PennyBunny", was released on March 17, 2012. Krahn shared it on Facebook and in forums, where it was shared as an open bug on the Sims 3 forums. It has since been uploaded over 5.9 million times, and has been reviewed hundreds of thousands of times.


More from the blog:


He said the mod allows for any Sims 3 save to be renamed, and it also allows a new "PennyBunny" account to add "bricks", where he will be the original person.


Many people on the forum called the "Brick" and added a link where the original would be added, and it was removed at around the same time. The original owner also said the mod would remove "trophies", where any Sims 3 video that was played by him could be renamed if he chose.


According to "You're my Sims" writer Sean T. Moore, he believes the hack will ultimately lead to a re-download of The Sims 3.


T. said: "It's so strange because I did not use "Brick". It's a small mod, no more than 5 MB in size. That's just how I imagined it - if it was done correctly. I don't know how to make that
