To whom may concern, Do you really think I would believe in this trash?n this trash? I believe in a god who would do for me whatever I am capable of. I believe in the divine, who can take me wherever I am needed. I believe in others, and I am committed to this world. I believe that the world is my life, my soul, my spirit, and my thoughts. I believe that this world has no end. I believe that this world has a purpose, as far as I am concerned.

Why do you think I hold this belief? Because it is what I think, and I do, and I say it is what I believe.
