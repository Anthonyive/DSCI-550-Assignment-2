YoHey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. few bucks but I would also like to keep the price low.

In the picture above, I have an entire body of my t-shirt. The rest of the body is printed on a black, white, and green font (as are the designs you can purchase). The rest of the body is printed using a red, black, and white, but you can find a print-out online that goes with the font size. I chose a yellow (white) one for the neck and shoulder.

This design uses a new fonts from http://kylereke-media.com but you can use whichever font you want.

My final design is a basic, utilitarian t-shirt (which is very very unusual. These are not very fancy but they look great with your style).

This design is a classic t-shirt with a small belly. The main shape is the back of my neck and upper left foot. The arms are still covered in fur.

You can find a print-out or send me an email about the design (e-mail, info@kylereke-media.com).
