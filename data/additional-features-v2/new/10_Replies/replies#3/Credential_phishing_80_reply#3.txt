Dear, Call me at 911. you can be, this is a man.

When I got to this point, I was very thankful. I still love you. I know you'll continue to be the best, smartest, most caring person in our family.

I don't have anything against those people. I really don't. I really don't. But I do know that those people in their right minds think it's all about them.

So I didn't get to sit down and write about how nice all of this is to me, but I do know that the way I live my life is really important to me. I know it's not just about doing this for the money.

It's about feeling so fulfilled, so beautiful, so proud of yourself. That's what they do. That's what we do. That's what our fathers do. That's what they do.

I really do.

I love you, and I'm just, I really like you, but I need to give you a little bit of space.

You're not going to be able to write this. You don't have much room, no matter how much we try. There's not much time, and I just need to find the right balance
