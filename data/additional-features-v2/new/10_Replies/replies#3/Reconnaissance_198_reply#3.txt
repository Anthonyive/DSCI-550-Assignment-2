Dear, You want my bank account, I'm having trouble turning the computer on. Can you help me? decided to withdraw from this business and get a job as a consultant. Your father and I have worked together at a time when everything went our way and today it is my turn to act.
I cannot control what my father do and I have tried very hard to get him back from his way and we have tried very hard to get him off this business.
I have been working closely with the executives of our corporation since August, 2008.  I will continue to work closely with them on this and I will not take any direct orders from my people to this decision. I will not give orders from my people as they will be acting in my name.
I will be very cooperative with the board if they are required to, and you can always call or email them when I am not working for them.
I have never taken any monetary penalties for any of my actions and they will not be given against my business for doing them.  I have never taken any monetary or disciplinary action against anyone who has been working for you or for you in good faith.
My father has been working for over a year now and his days are full of busy work. I was just told that I would not be able to be a consultant due to the current state of my affairs
