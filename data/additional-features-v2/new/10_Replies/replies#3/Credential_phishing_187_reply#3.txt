Hey,Call me at 911. restoring Gulf Bank funds and providing the money to the people, please sign my petition on my website, www.sassimbank.com, which lists a number of places you can go and help.
Dear Saudi Arabia and Qatar, please do sign this petition and provide us with the funds we need and help us fix the problem. As you know we are on the brink of collapse. I am the only one on the Gulf Bank who has pledged my support, and has been asking us to support him to the end. If you can do what you can, please make sure to support him first, in this matter for the sake of the Kuwait people. This is what Saudi Arabia is trying to accomplish through its money laundering and banking schemes.
We also want to pay our debts. Our people want the United States to be a great partner, not a bad partner. But that is not an option for your country.
We call on you to get involved and help us rebuild the Kuwait Bank of Kuwait. The Kuwait Bank of Kuwait is on the verge of collapse and could go bankrupt at any time and its members and shareholders would have to be stripped of their rights in Kuwait or face loss of assets due to corruption.
Thank you. We hope that you will come
