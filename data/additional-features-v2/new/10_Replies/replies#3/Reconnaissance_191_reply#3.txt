Dear, Stop sending message to this email address or I'll call the cops! in the public interest, of the public interest with regard to science.
Why are we fighting this war? The reasons are different. First, these corporations are building laboratories to develop new ways of life. And they have built very interesting laboratories in the U.S. and Canada, and in some cases are building large laboratories that are capable of producing the first and strongest strains of life on earth.
Second, they are using technology to develop new techniques and new ways of studying. And there are many ways in which these technologies might be used to develop life on Earth.
Some of them use genetic techniques to help our brains develop. But most use biological mechanisms to help our brains evolve.
To test these methods, U.S. Department of Education is conducting research on a method called epigenetics (see http://www.academia.edu/projects/epigenetics/). It involves identifying and studying genes that, when transcribed, allow the body to grow older and grow in ways that benefit individuals and the planet, and that helps humans to build and maintain healthy, healthy immune systems.
These techniques could provide new and faster therapies that aid with our health. A second major finding is that these epigenetics have different effects depending on how much exposure we
