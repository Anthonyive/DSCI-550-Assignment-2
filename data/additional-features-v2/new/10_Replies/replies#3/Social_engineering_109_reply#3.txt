That is an issue that is really, really big for us, which is why we are being very careful to ensure that there is no such issue on our network. We know that we have an issue there, and we have seen that it happened in another, not-so-very-subtle way. It is why we are doing everything we can to minimize it, and to not be at the risk of being attacked. Because if there is one thing that we will be able to control, that is that we will be able to address that problem internally, and I'm sure you are quite aware of that.
I'm told that with any of these issues we are going to have problems, and there will be many other, in the future, that our team has to deal with, and you and I have to deal with this. With any of these issues we are going to have problems, and there will be many other problems that our team has to deal with. A lot of you people have been at this for a long time. How often has that happened? I want to clarify. This was just in the news last year.
