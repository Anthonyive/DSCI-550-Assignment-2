Hey,You want my bank account, I'm having trouble turning the computer on. Can you help me?, make a political decision.
The fact of the matter is, it has been five years, and all of these events are now underway, and you are part of the process in that. I won't talk about any particular player, whether or not they would really like to be part of that process.
And I think that's a good start. I certainly don't think that's the case, particularly not for other players. I think it's a good start.
The fact that we now are seeing those events, I think that that will become a political situation. And I mean, the fact that we are seeing the player, who's made great strides in his development and his career, come out and go and to really show the world that we play, it's only natural that players in the league look back upon that and say: "What you saw there, you should have seen here."
That's why you see other leagues here as well. So again, we are getting our players ready, our fans ready for the next World Cup, and you will see how quickly this can turn into a political situation.
We are very happy that we have achieved, very happy that that happened, because it is happening to players all over the world who
