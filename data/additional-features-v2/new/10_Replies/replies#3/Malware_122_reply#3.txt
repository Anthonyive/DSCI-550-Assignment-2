Dear, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks!tion? Thanks!

Hi, This is John, a customer service representative at the RCA with my order. The phone is broken, but I have returned it in 5 minutes.

Thank you very much for doing this to your order.

Thanks John!

As I said, my friend and I wanted to send an email to you before we made the purchase and it was only the receipt. But all I did was check my package, it was completely untouched and was never opened. All my money went straight to the RCA. I will not do this again. If I needed more, I would do the same.

Please let us know what you think:


John,

Thank you!<|endoftext|>
