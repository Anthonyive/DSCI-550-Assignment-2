Hello, Call me at 911.ll me at 911. I'm David Rennie. I'm a firefighter, firefighter, and retired officer, living in the foothills of Texas. As soon as I walked in the door of my car it was cold. I couldn't figure out why the wind was so strong. I turned back, looked to my right and said, "Oh, the heat's on my roof". I don't know how. I had heard of a fire department's "no heat" policy, but I was confused, I didn't want to find out. I didn't want to call anyone about it, and I didn't want to worry that the guy that was on the phone might have a problem. But the guy that was on the phone, he had an issue. I was like, "What?", I don't even know why this guy didn't help me, how can the heat be so strong that my roof has collapsed? This guy has no idea how much heat I'm being exposed to...he didn't even know how much heat my hood is getting at my roof! The heat is literally putting my lungs into a bad spot, and I'm trying to stop it! He told me that he was at the gym on Monday, and he said he's going to give me an alarm for when the wind gets back up...I'm not sure if there's any kind of warning about that...the wind is like 6 am, so this guy needs to come home and go check for me...and he is, but he got scared for him. He told me that his son-in-law gave him a phone call. He said, "This guy is so crazy he'll get in my car and take my keys and I'll have to start over!" Oh my gosh, I don't know. What happened? Oh my gosh I thought it would be better that I take my keys out and then take all my stuff out of there for a moment and then get back up. I thought that was the best thing that could happen to us. The cold was on my roof.
