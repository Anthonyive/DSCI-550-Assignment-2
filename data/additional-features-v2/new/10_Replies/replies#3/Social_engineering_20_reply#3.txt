To whom may concern, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! you want to put this in your head and take your mind off it.

But it's time to be a better musician...

I want a voice.

There's nothing better than having something.

What do you do?

I don't.

I work my ass off.

I want a voice.

I need someone to take care of me if I can't handle this stuff.

Even if I don't have a voice.

I don't know what to do.

Whatever.

I need someone to take care of me.

Just keep doing that.

You're the kind that would be a star in your own life.

You're the kind that could even break people's hearts with you.

If you don't know what that's about, or if you don't trust your parents, or if you're too lazy to really try, or if you don't know what the last thing you want is for someone else to be like you, then you can't help it.

Then, you might as well quit at it.

Don't worry about it. I'll show you just how good you are.
