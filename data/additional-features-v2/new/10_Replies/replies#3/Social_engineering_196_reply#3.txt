Hi, I don't know.  don't know.  If you've been reading my blog, you know I've been going through some pretty serious issues lately.
I get angry every time I read a blog post about something like this.  I see dozens of posts with headlines that state "Mumbai is now "diverse" or "I want to live a better life", or "this is the best community in Bangalore", or even "this is my favourite city, my favourite place to work in, the best place to spend the night".


I feel like an idiot.  It's like we're walking through a mall filled with junk and shit.  I like walking through malls, but what if the mall didn't come?  What if all I had to do was go to the wrong mall and miss out on something worth visiting?  I can't imagine how hard it would be, how much work it would take, or whether my next stop would be in a different mall or one where I didn't get to pick a random piece of garbage.  I wonder, is this a reasonable question or just a joke?


Well, not really.  You can't get much smarter than me, or even a lot smarter than the guy who runs the news feed of the internet, I hope.
