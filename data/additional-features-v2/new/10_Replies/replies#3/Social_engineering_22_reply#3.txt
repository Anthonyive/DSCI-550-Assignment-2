To whom may concern, I'll let my son help me. them in different colors of the house.  I really liked that the color scheme was a little different, so I did that.  I've got a lot of crazy ideas going, so check out this post for more details!
Also, here's my "gift" from my Secret Santa, which I was able to take home!  
Thank you for all the work you've done this month!<|endoftext|>
