Hello, Your computer has been hacked. a fund to provide care for this poor little boy. At this point he needs a wheelchair, because he is suffering from various ailments. Unfortunately for him, there is no place for this donation here, so it is very hard for him to find the funds needed to keep with his life.
This is not meant to discourage anyone, nor is it meant to discourage any business, but to help him to live and to be with his people. This is not to tell others that it is okay to be sick, as long as it does not affect you in any way. This is also not meant to give people any money, as that would simply give them the opportunity to save this little boy, or even have them help him to live. The idea here was that in case something happened, their parents would not do anything, that would be okay. It just needs to be clear that they are not giving you any money, and not letting your family be taken away to make up for this loss and suffering.
