To whom may concern, You wanted my SSN, here is my birthday, where are you located? Treasury Department
U.S. Government
As I understood it from a financial security standpoint, my business business is legal. I take personal responsibility for any future financial losses to be determined by the Attorney General. So in order to protect my business, I took personal responsibility for the harm the Government caused to my business. The Federal Government is very pleased with the way I operate my business. It is my belief that I cannot be held responsible for any failure to do what I did by attempting to breach a U.S. Bank Securities Commission order.
I am grateful for the support from your IRS agency and the Department of Justice. They are involved in very important tax matters, such as the Federal Government's tax compliance activities. I will be contacting my IRS and I will provide an update soon.
I will also be contacting the IRS and asking them to put the matter up for review. Once the matter is taken up by the IRS, and no further action is taken on it, I will be able to give you a full explanation and send you a free copy of my order.
Thank you. Thank you for your time.
