Hey,I am a genius! am a genius! I'm from a small town in Maine. The town has good water and a large zoo.

I am an amateur comic artist from Australia with love for all things comics. I am trying out different mediums, creating artwork to promote my new series and the other side of my artistic spectrum.I am very into all things comics, and I really enjoy learning about all forms of mediums. I also consider myself a bit geeky so as to not over-prove my knowledge.<|endoftext|>
