Hi, How can I get the money?et the money? Thanks for your response!


I've contacted the owner, he told me he was having problems with the door. I'm not sure how long he would take to get everything back in order, but my money is still on the way. They could do a replacement and refund my money, but I wouldn't be able to afford them. Should I ask them to do this?


I can't talk to the owner for another 5-10 days to get my back in order, he's already been doing it with the door repaired. Just got out from work on Friday at around 2 PM and have now arrived at the car wash. He has sent me a text saying he just received a message from the dealership, it's not from them but from her email. He said they can't refund my money and that they'd refund the full amount. He also said they will call and check on me immediately to help resolve the situation. If it doesn't work right with my husband and I, he's leaving us and getting ready to have the car towed. I just can't afford the legal fees. If he does, I'm going to have to leave him a few extra dollars or have my money refunded and have to get back in my truck.<|endoftext|>
