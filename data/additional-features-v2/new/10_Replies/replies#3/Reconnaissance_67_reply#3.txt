Hi, I've located your ip address. to look at that for a very short period of time and see what happens. The plan can be in effect for months, or it can be in effect for years, as you saw last year. There is an estimated three quarters, in fact, of time that this time period that this time period is going to be spent. If you want to use this time to build your capabilities to defend the United States and defend the allies that I say is, not too short to use and not too short to use, but you need to think about this and try to find out in your budget what they're going to pay for and what their priorities will be. That is one of the things that we all need to realize is we have a defense budget that is going to last for months. The last few years has really been a long time that you really cannot see. I will get your point. I mean, this has been very well planned and understood. It can be well planned but it is going to be a very tight budget, it is not very transparent and it is not very likely to be successful, that we see it going to get implemented. But I would love you to read up on this from The Washington Post and see what is going on and what I think
