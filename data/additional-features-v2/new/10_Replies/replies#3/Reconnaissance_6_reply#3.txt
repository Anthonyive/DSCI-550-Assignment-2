The Republican Party Of Iowa


For those of you who didn't already know how much it means to support the Republican Party. Thank you so much. You are amazing, man. It all began when my family moved here. I was just 16 when we moved out to San Luis Obispo, California, and when my parents got married, my mother was pregnant with our second child, and I loved a little bit, too.

In that space we had a tiny family with an active life of friendship, a beautiful little farm and we always knew that being raised in a small town meant supporting our mother with her money. I was fortunate because my aunt's mom, a single mother, used to live near mine. I just remember sitting next to her. I wasn't going to let her down, either. When I was 16, my parents had a family in the neighborhood with us. I knew it was just their chance
