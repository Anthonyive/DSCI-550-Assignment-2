Hey,Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. Associate to work for your university research project.
After posting about my project, please keep in mind that I am very interested in the position as a researcher for other societies/industries like medical research. I want to know why you think this may have come to an end. What would you like to know about my career?
I don't think the current status of a job in the fields of social science is satisfactory. I would like to ask you if you think the current condition is bad in all of you, and what you would like to improve in that field. For example, if you think science is boring, then I'd like to know how to improve it in all of your fields and what would you like to improve in others in that field. As for any question regarding your current position, please feel free to send me a message.
Thank you for your interest in the position. If you would like to receive more ideas, please visit my webpage: https://www.mysterical-research.net/app_images/mysterical.png
