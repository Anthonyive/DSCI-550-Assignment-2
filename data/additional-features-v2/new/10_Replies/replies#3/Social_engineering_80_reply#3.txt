Hi, Thank you so much!Hi, Thank you for being a part of my community of developers and fans of the GameCube, a game we have been trying our best to recapture over the past six or seven years for some time and I'm sure many of you have noticed it's getting much of the focus back in the U.S. A few months ago at E3 the GameCube was the most expensive console in the world when it came to software sales.

At the same time we were getting pretty good press to get it going with other systems and the GameCube was the only console where the new release was much easier to get started with. It was one of those consoles we just bought so we had to make sure we had everything in stock before we went to the store (and we did). We're sure many of you missed my post about the GameCube, but I'll do my best to explain the details later.

The GameCube was released in Japan in 2004 with a new cartridge and a much more limited edition. This allowed us to take an average of about 30 hours out of your day. This means I need you to know exactly how much time we actually have to spend playing the game every month or so.

The game was fairly buggy, and the graphics were limited
