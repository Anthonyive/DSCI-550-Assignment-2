Hello, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! do not know that I had a nightmare, but a nightmare. I am very scared, and my fear seems to be due to the intense sleepiness. I am afraid that a bad dream may have happened. In order to cure my dream, I think that there may be a cure for my dream. In the meantime, I am sure that I am making a positive effort to come back to the job and make my dreams a healthy part of my life and this has become an everyday thing of my life.

It is a wonderful feeling, and i believe that I am doing great.

Yours sincerely,

Sangeet Kishore
