Hello, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks!, all my thoughts, everything I could see was that I was not going to do anything anymore. I wasn't even 100% sure that I was going to do anything, and then suddenly I heard some stuff. I thought "that might be it" or "maybe I am really strong and I am lucky". I really feel like I wasn't going to do any more. I tried to do everything I could to keep from losing the love I had for your father, but it wasn't working out so I'm trying to take it from there.

I feel sick to my stomach right now. I feel sick, I feel sick to my head, it's been such a hard one. I'm so sorry for all the pain and hardship I've put myself through. My heart goes out to you all.

Goodbye,

Karen

P.S. I was going to get in trouble and try to get this thread closed down but I went ahead and did it instead by deleting the following file:

Now if I could have used that I would have!

Thanks,

Beth.
