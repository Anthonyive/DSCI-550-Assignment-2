To whom may concern, You want my bank account, I'm having trouble turning the computer on. Can you help me? is Chris, and I am an Assistant Professor of Public Affairs at Duke University. I have worked in the department of political science, civil rights, and human rights for 25 years. At Duke I have focused on community issues related to civil rights since 1986. My writing career started when I was studying public policy and has been ongoing as a senior lecturer and research assistant for several years. As a junior, I worked for George Mason University, served as the state clerk to a governor's office in Maryland, and served as a district attorney.
Chris' research interests include a wide range of public policy issues. In my research interests I have focused on the role of the police on the rise, transition, and subsequent changes to the police force in America and have been engaged in civil rights initiatives that have been challenging the very notion that police officers should be punished for the use of force. Recently, I also spent a little time on social justice issues in our state. In fact, I have worked on these issues so many times that my experience with the police is just that - a bit more background on the issue. I am grateful to my family and friends to support me in my work, and to those in my career who have provided great service and education and support. I hope you
