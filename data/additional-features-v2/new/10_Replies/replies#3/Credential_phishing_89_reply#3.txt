Hey,OMG I'm so lucky!I'm so lucky! My kids were doing a lot of amazing things while I was away with the kids. They're very happy and are excited to get back to doing things that you all did.

Do you know how much I love you both so much, how much I miss seeing you and your great new book so much, my husband and I are all so proud of you guys, and it means a lot to all of you that I'll never have to travel with you again. I thank you very much. You and I will always be there for your success.<|endoftext|>
