To whom may concern, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! also pay you when your parcel arrives on the other side (i.e. you get it in your country)If you have other questions for us (for example you have an issue with international customers/customers service here or want to use the refund option, this can be added to your question to help get an answer here ).Please feel free to leave a message if you have any questions.<|endoftext|>
