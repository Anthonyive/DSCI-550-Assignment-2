Hey,You have been located that first transaction went through (for those who can read over their email, the first one took a few weeks to arrive), and with the fact that there has been no confirmation of this, there may well be something wrong with this that I'm going to leave out of this article and leave unmentioned and I won't get my hands on it in the near future. I don't believe it's a bad design, so I don't think it's really a bad thing to have the card, but the card it's going to have if you don't like Target's online shopping experience is probably not going to help the average user much.

Target, thank you for your time, and thank you for being so generous. You helped my organization grow and helped our associates and business community by offering that new service, and I thank you for your service. And once again, we'll be back with another newsletter soon, this time on retail.com (in all likelihood, it will change the format of this post).

If you're interested in signing up for the newsletter or signing up for the newsletter for any other reason, it's really best for you to do the following in an email. It's easy, you just send one to your mailbox.
