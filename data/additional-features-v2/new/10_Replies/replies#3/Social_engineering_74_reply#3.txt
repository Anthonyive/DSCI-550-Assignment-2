Hi everyone,I'm a professional photographer. This is the first time I'm posting on my blog, but I have a couple things I would like to share here.First: If you're going to be posting on my blog, then I would appreciate a few small edits:A note, because in order for the email account to work properly, you'll need to sign in to your account. I know that is more work than you need to get in touch with me via message. I have a pretty long blog which spans a few years, so that doesn't include much of an effort. You may feel that your information is up to date, but this is a personal blog to look into if you'd like to post it here.In this update, I've made a lot of changes to the way it's handled, like the use of a separate "User ID" for my users, I'm also making an additional section to add to "contact".I won't be posting about these things, except to say that I've made some very important changes since writing this.These are all minor changes, so don't expect this update to look anything like what's already been published.These are the things I've noticed myself, and why I wanted to include them in this update:The following screenshots are from my official blog. I've added some links here and there to them, but I'm going to leave that for some time, but it's a part of the reason I'm not posting these up in a specific thread.
