Dear, I don't have my own computer, could you buy me one?:


"John, will this app be re-installed in the future if I don't answer your calls again?"

- John

Thanks for the good feedback. There's a lot of work here!


Thanks to the reviewers who continue to support the app, it's pretty easy to get rid of the old app and get a new one. We'll update this site when we've added support for Windows Phone 8. The app will be free to use, however if you want to pay for an older version you'll need to keep this button on your phone.


Any questions I receive are always open to the possibility of sending in more.


- Sean

Thanks for your feedback on this app.


In the meantime, thanks for your patience! If you're having trouble making use of our app, we think there are better ways and ideas on how to use the app!


As a thanks, there are three more reviews being posted now:

- Sean's Review


- A Review from John


What do you think of Sean's review of the game? Does it represent a game that you feel the same way about or maybe have more in common with?
