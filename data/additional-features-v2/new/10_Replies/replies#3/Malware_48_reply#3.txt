Hi, You wanted my SSN, here is my birthday, where are you located?  Thank you very much for stopping by, MySpace. The Love-Love! Reply Delete
Hi Vinnie, Thank you for visiting MySpace and I am glad to see you here.  I wanted to try out the content you provided in your blog, because you are obviously doing what I do.  Since the site opened over a year ago, people have been requesting what content I would like to submit and my work has expanded exponentially. You are a great writer and creator, thank you for your continued support. Reply Delete
@MySpace I was asked by a reader on Tumblr last year if I could make a "Hello Everyone" page that would make "Meanings" or "Suffering" for children, or would it be something like this? He said "Hey, this is what you mean. I can upload it right away." I knew right away that MySpace would be on there, with all its content that you and my site, and that it would be as useful as it is today. Thanks for taking the time to read it. Reply Delete
