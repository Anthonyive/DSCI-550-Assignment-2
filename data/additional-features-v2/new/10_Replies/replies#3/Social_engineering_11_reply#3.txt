Hey,You have been located back there, so I did not come home on time. I went with the younger of the sisters, who is older than me, and it was as if they always told me about how much they enjoyed this country. The older sisters told me of the days they always spent in the woods, or to go out to play with their friends. If one were to look directly at me or speak to me, they said that they didn't know how to walk, to work, or to go far. "We took her and her sisters for walks," she told me. "She did walk all day, and sometimes she was even playing with themâ€¦ I thought that was it."

I decided to follow her to the front yard. I was very wary of the treehouse that would hold the yard. But after I left it, the children and other relatives said that they did not like any of the old houses there. The old houses seemed too large for me and I kept my distance from any of them, but those people were just curious.

"I was on my way out, my mom said something like, 'Oh, that little girl in the nursery was right there. There was some girl out there who had a lot of questions about it.'
