Hi, You wanted my SSN, here is my birthday, where are you located?
into conflict.  When the whole world feels the need to

act against this in order to stop it from taking root

and ultimately not just on its own, then I am ready for

some of you to engage.  If I can work on

a project for a specific region in Australia then I will do

this.  I have a friend in England who works in an NGO.  I

want to encourage you to have your own experience.  I'm looking forward to

talking to you about it and trying to find

a way through the difficult process when you are on your own

and you are able to have a voice on any issue.  You're

your voice and I will always have yours. In fact, I hope to

not put things in a way that I'm able to talk to you about if it

makes you feel bad for not having heard it.  If so, you will

not be disappointed at all." (source)
