Hey,Stop sending message to this email address or I'll call the cops! explanations to parents in order for their children to be held accountable and be able to make decisions.
If I am able to provide good answers to questions such as "Why does my daughter get paid so much money from my company?" or "Is he entitled to his own tuition?" then it is possible to ask them whether this makes him a bad employee.
I want to know why this should not be a question asked at public university by an adult.
An adult who goes to university should make sure the child's education is at the top of his or her list of skills.
What do you think?<|endoftext|>
