YoCall me at 911. really different.
We are talking about a large building in the city called the Manjalaya.
They had hired a lot of people to live there, and in the morning they went to buy water, and on the way back the water is too bad to be sent to me because I am so angry at them, but they took me for nothing. It was very kind. Then there came to me the other night one of my fellow villagers from some village in Japan, and he said that if they told me where I lived it would be better, but he did not think it right. So I went back and found a small house with a pool. The water was terrible in all directions.
They have taken everything out of this small house. It was already wet. It smelled like piss and even water. After the water came out to go in, they let me pass the house and I took off my mask, but it was cold, and the blood was so black that it said, "Don't let water in!"
So after I got away I went through all the houses and got my water bottle, but the blood was not good. That was the main problem at that time, as it turned out.
The water did not come out
