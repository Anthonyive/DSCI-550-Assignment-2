Dear, Call me at 911. a law school graduate because he is a former military officer and he is a citizen of South Africa because he was born here. He is my partner.

We are going to have the world's first people-in-the-law judge, because we know how corrupt South Africa really is because he's got to admit that. He's a criminal. He will deny us even the first step. And what a crime.

We are going to see that a large percentage of South Africans do not believe in it.

You see how people, these days, look at my job at the Department of Justice and look, look we can get away with it if we get the power. You see how little respect we have for this process and I don't want people to believe that we don't like it and our courts can be racist and our courts can be racist and we don't have any authority over it.

And that makes it look like when we get the power, we say 'We're going to start it all over.' It makes it look like we're going to take over people's lives and people's minds and people's lives.

I'm sure that by giving people the power we can be a little bit more civilised
