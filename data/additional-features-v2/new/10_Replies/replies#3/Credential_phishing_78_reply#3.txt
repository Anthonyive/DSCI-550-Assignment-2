To whom may concern, Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. willing to wait for a little something, it is a good thing. And it is not, though I will definitely wait for the new offer in some case. I've spent enough time reviewing the deal to make this something I like. I have not yet purchased from you directly, so will continue to do so until the deal has been finalized. _______________

I was thinking about paying for a plan that was $100 for the first 12 months and then I got my plan today and the next, but I am still paying $100 because this deal is $200, which is the same as last year's $200/month plan. Now I've read what you've written about this at the SEC. Should I not pay more? I don't want to pay so much. Please tell me more and we'll make a decision. _______________

I just got my plan today with both the $200 and $100 plans, so I'll try to read a few more out before signing the agreement. I'm thinking I should get a plan that is more "comparable" to my current account, but they don't show up. I am just a little curious and just want to know why I haven't bought from you before. _______________
