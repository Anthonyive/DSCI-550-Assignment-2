Dear, I need to verify your identityyour identity. I'm being followed for 10 minutes every time I walk by someone with a fake social security number. In the first place, every time I take pictures and I'm asked to sign my name, it's not my first time I sign that. In fact, I just wanted to show you that I was on my way. After I was able to prove to people that the two of them are real people, I've finally been able to take a look at my social security number. That's when I learned that I might not be able to take pictures of everyone I want to. So I need your help.
