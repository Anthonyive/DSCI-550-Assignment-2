Hi, You are the lier! and he has never shown us to be mean and cruel to others. I am so saddened by this.  It is heartbreaking to see him be torn apart just so that we can all get through this.  It is scary to know that our love is still only able to give me the strength it used to be. In his absence, I feel his love.  I don't know how we could have ever come together, but the fact he has kept coming back to us like this and he cares for me and his family is something we owe to him.  I will leave the world and die alone.
