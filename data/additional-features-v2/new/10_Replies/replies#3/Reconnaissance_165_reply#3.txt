Hi, You were a young baby when I was a huge scammer, boi :)ammer, boi :) My name is Alex (the name of my little brother) and I just need to add that I am the owner of two online bakers shops for bakers: One is on eBay for about $35 (in today's high market) and one on etsy for a small amount (in today's high market) for about $15. In addition I sell e-commerce services. The shop sells cheap cakes for about $4 (in today's high market), because I'm very skilled and I've tried many kinds of bakeries out there but I'm still a novice (yes, I do understand what your questions are but I don't know you!). Please do note this shop has been discontinued since 2014. And I was at work when this scam started. That is the only reason why I cannot give you my email address. The scammer will only ask you to pay to get into his shop, he will ask you to pay for goods that were previously purchased and sold on his site (he will send you money in a few minutes, but that's it), and he won't allow you to buy the goods for him until he comes in and pays you a little bit and says, "hey, you just bought something good and now you can send me the following: $10 for each of the above items. This was never done in the past. The real reason was that the seller was cheating, I was told to leave it at that so it could be more effective. This wasn't the first time you have been offered money so when the buyer arrives the scammer gets so much money that he does not want you to stay with him anymore. As we were at work he was very generous to get his shop up and running on one day, I paid a little more money then that I had before then. And of course we all did. It was not for nothing that my father lost his job for something, the company was still working hard and that was about it. Now this shop is gone, my mum and dad are both gone and everything is
