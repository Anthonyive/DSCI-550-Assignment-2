Hello, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! season (only available to top 4 players).Earn Team Members Points for the highest tier and continue the league for at least 5 seasons. You can also get Team Members Points directly by finishing a season in the PVP season. We know that in the PVP community, "participation in a tournament is way too easy," and we're excited to see how popular those teams will be.This season of The PVP is full of exciting new features for players, new achievements for achievements, and a great way to earn more points. In fact, it's not even like it's an even contest because every team in The PVP Season Ends now has at least one player of each level that's been ranked 1, 2 and 3. You'll earn more points with every ranked team than you could without playing, and you'll still get a small amount of extra points, especially when going for the top.Each team has a unique story you can choose from. The story is the core mechanic: when you play as a character, you can learn more about the game and what you're doing. That's all. You just have to play. No online play. No fighting. No teamwork. No talking. What we hope you do is open your eyes to this world!
