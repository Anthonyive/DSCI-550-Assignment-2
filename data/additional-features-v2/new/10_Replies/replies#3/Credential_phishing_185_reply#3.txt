Hi, Your computer has been hacked. the most positive person ever to come out of that life.
One day the counselor's came in with the following in mind and we all said we wanted to help him and we went to sit on a couch so we could chat with him.  He is going to be a great help for us and we are willing to help him.  So, we sat on a couch and we did the same thing in the mental ward and we have two young minds who want to give him help, and we are willing to help.  There is nothing I have learned that will turn a blind eye to this and I have thought it would be good to share that information with a couple of other people who may have similar situations.  I also realize that maybe this is just a case of some guy who is having trouble thinking straight, but he is in the same building as our son and that may be the reason we just don't know where he went after this.  We have a lot of other problems we have that may have happened but we need to talk to our parents and they have told us not to talk about them at the time. I think they have helped and will continue to help, but at this point we have no idea where to go
