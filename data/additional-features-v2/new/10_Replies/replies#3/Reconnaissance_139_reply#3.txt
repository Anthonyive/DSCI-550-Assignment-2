To whom may concern, Thank you so much!

Federation

P. O. Box 776

New York, NY 10012-5756

I urge our Members to

come together

for peace and understanding. To stand together and fight for

those principles,

for this country,

for freedom and

justice.

Please do not allow

this to stand. Please understand that you can never

break our

freedom. If any member

ever steps out of line, we all will lose. We cannot

give up a nation of rights that

gives us so much at stake.

Freedom must be

expressed and protected.

We cannot allow those in authority

to abuse our freedoms,

protect us by stealing our wealth and by

bribes and

tax cuts that benefit

the rich. Our leaders have

learned that democracy,

in some ways

is not something to be proud of.<|endoftext|>
