I don't remember what my dad did but my Mom called me from school to tell me my dad was going to be there because my mom said he felt so bad for him. I was shocked. I called the news office and my father just came down and said, 'My dad is with us right now.' My dad says he was sitting there talking to you. He said to me, 'I didn't know you were here this year.' So I called my dad and I couldn't sleep.

In 2012, the U.S. Postal Service admitted there are over 100,000 American postal workers.

In 2013, some of the agency's inspectors found at least five instances of mail containing expired stamps. In one, there was a "newer error" in an envelope. In another, the new postage stamp could not be retrieved after the mail had been delivered.<|endoftext|>
