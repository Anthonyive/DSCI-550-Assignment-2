Hello, How can I get the money?et the money?

We're running a project to give our clients a way to pay for shipping costs.

The goal of this Kickstarter is to raise $20K, and to make sure that all orders shipped to us are shipped free of charge.

How do you make these shipping costs?

Our backers can choose to pay for shipping, or they can pay for them. To make this step easy to navigate, you can create a campaign here.

What can we expect?

Shipments will be taken within 4 to 6 weeks of our deadline (but please feel free to ask if you are shipping anything earlier!). In any case we also make sure that items we send to you go through the same process we do in the Kickstarter campaign.

I am sorry for any issues while I am onboard.

Please note, that orders will not ship with a shipping address because that's where the postage/delivery is shipped (we do have to put it out there for you if you don't want that address on your order and would like to buy the item or if you are getting it from a special retail address such as Home Depot). We also do not have the time or expertise to ship items that do not arrive quickly.

We'll send a couple of extra items to your address within a month of delivery with tracking, so even if we don't ship you your item within a month it will be shipped within a month of being shipped.

If we don't have that address, or if it's not part of your original order, please send in your questions so that we can answer them as quickly as possible.

Why is this important?

Shipping costs are one of our biggest expenses as a company. We already have one large shipping address that is used by over 500 stores. We will need to set our budget for the fulfillment and tracking cost on the shipping address.

If you are interested in being a backer of this project and would like to be able to add any additional items that you would like to
