To whom may concern, Call me at 911. you can do, through the work you have brought me to do.

My heart breaks every time I think of the time when you lost someone. I cannot thank you enough for your service to this country. Thank you very much.

Your Honor, I would like to take the opportunity to share my concern with you in one of my latest emails. I wanted to let you know that my office will be asking members of Congress to share the information that they have about this event in response to your concern, but also to ensure that there is no disruption.

My office plans to contact you soon, but would appreciate your cooperation in sharing the information with our staff and through our website.

As I mentioned, I believe the tragedy of the Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting was not the result of any conspiracy or any conspiracy to commit violence. Our nation must remember that all human beings are capable of caring for one another and of holding one another accountable. We are united in this effort to protect America from terrorism.

As always, I would be happy to assist in any way you can help us with our response to this emergency situation.

Thank you for your good faith.

Sincerely,

Shannon G. Miller<|endoftext|>
