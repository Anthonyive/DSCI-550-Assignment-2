Hey,I don't have my own computer, could you buy me one?~ I am on Facebook. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I am on facebook http://www.facebook.com/ChloeHate-NATE I am on twitter http://www.twitter.com/chloehate Nate is a great friend of mine ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ So what did you guys say about the interview you wanted to do? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Let's just say the most difficult interview I've ever had in my life. It's been really hard. This has been kind of like being on my mother's side of this whole thing. She didn't really make it through to the end so it was kind of hard to explain. I always was the first to ask and she was like, "we're happy that you're not on the other side of this" I was like "no, there are really two sides." I think she was really disappointed, because her mother was, it was all right here right where I was in the house right next to her. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Anyway, we really wanted to talk. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ So this interview was amazing. I would say it was the hardest and had the most impact on me. It's just hard
