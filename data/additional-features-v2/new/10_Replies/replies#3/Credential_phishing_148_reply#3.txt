Hi, Do you really think I would believe in this trash?, because of the bad contract situation.I will probably keep the old phone until I die, but I'm afraid that it will be ruined forever, because I am really tired and trying to focus on whatever I was thinking. I may even look for money. My mother is also not very good at life, and it would not be good for me to do this. I will try my best. I have a good future and nothing could ever make me happy like getting married, but I want to keep going to work, so if I'm ready, I'll be done with my job, and I'll have to live a normal life here as a child, since I want my next job to be to raise my three older children.The people I'm dealing with will be my friends and family. My old family, which was really nice when I was 6, was very bad now. I need to get rid of all of that and move on. I'll talk with my uncle now, the only person in my family who I can rely on... I've had so many people ask about this one, and they say there is no way this person could have survived after my accident, so I need to go into a different place, and see if I can find someone
