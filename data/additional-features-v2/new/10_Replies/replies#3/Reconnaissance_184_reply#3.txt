Dear, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks!, today, our children are no more than slaves to the masters, I believe that all of us can achieve things that we are not allowed to have, for reasons that I believe are important to me. So today, people from all backgrounds can do much good in this society, for the things that we have achieved as children. I also hope that we can make this country a better place for all Africans and people from all backgrounds to work together in order to create a better future for everyone.

This speech can only be made for the very people who I have raised and who are working in it; it is my privilege to say so. It is my privilege to ask, with an open mind about what you are going to do and what you can achieve with each step, with your attitude and your actions and how you will respond. I will tell you that this speech belongs to those who are doing what we need to do. I am going to try to ask everyone to try. But when we say our goodbyes, if everyone listens to me, this way people know we are listening to them and that we do not hold back. Therefore I have been working for this country since 1966, so you can know that I am a true, independent, democratic,
