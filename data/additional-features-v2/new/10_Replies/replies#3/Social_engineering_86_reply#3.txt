Hello, Thank you so much! thank you, sir.

SENIOR COMMENTARY BY VIRGINI HAZARD:

A. The Central Board is responsible for our banking institutions.

The Central Board has an obligation to respond to inquiries and the Central Bank of Hong Kong. The Central Board has jurisdiction over all accounts that are created from accounts created for the Hong Kong community, except those with the capacity to pay the Bank's fees.

I am requesting that the Central Bank of Hong Kong provide more information regarding my account.

B. The Central Board has jurisdiction over an account created to pay the Bank's fees for the Hong Kong community and has had its authority diminished for the better. Please note, we do not agree with the fact that the bank reserves these funds on request.

C. The Central Board, the Central Board of Hong Kong and the Central Bank of Hong Kong are all of the same order. We did not send our money. We are all of the same order.

D. My account forms will show some discrepancies between our account information and their accounts information.

E. The Central Board may be helpful and will provide you with specific financial information.

F. Your bank account is now under your control.
