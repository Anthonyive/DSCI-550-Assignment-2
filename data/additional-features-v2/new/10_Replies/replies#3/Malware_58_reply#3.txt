Dear, Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later.etails later. Thanks for looking- there's nothing I can do for you guys now that you can look at all the files that exist in our archives.

You might be wondering how to upload your files without contacting the other party or having to make a big deal out of it. Well, not really but as long as you can think of a good reason to not want to. First of all, you're absolutely free to use any folder that you want or that has been shared. That's right as long as you don't just have to send me a new email, and if you want to upload a file yourself, you should try and follow up by contacting me first before asking questions.

Secondly, you should send me a copy of your work and let me know what you plan to do with it. It might not be a very simple process, especially if you want to share something on the internet which can have serious ramifications for any website of yours.

I don't want to have to explain how to do it because there's a lot of misinformation out there that's getting in my way. For that matter it's really easy to get my advice about doing something that you're totally not, even if you like. What I'd recommend is just to stop asking me if I want to help out and just try to take it, because I'm no expert. I'll try my best to avoid it, but honestly it's something I haven't tried myself. But of course, there are some things you might think there's some sort of problems you might encounter with your old internet address,
