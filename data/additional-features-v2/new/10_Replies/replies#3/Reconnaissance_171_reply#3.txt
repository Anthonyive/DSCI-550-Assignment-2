To whom may concern, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! last update came in on June 17. I knew my wife was moving again. I just wanted to say thank you all.The gifts came in at about 8.30am on my new Sunday. It was cold at the time and so I bought some airfare and stuff for my car so I headed to the mall. Then when I got home, I knew a huge package was coming. As soon as I opened it up for myself, I was blown away. It was just a beautiful package with a smiley face and big purple box.I am so happy I got home from shopping and I am really excited to get this gift to be delivered to my door!I hope you will be as happy as I am with our new Santa!<|endoftext|>
