Hello, You are the lier!are the lier!


So this is me. I am very disappointed. I love your videos and I appreciate being on stage and working with you again and again. You are awesome to all of us but you are not the best on the stage.


You have also got to go ask other people. My father has been having a mental breakdown and he started getting into all sorts of things but he was fine and I don't think he needs any more therapy. My mom would have let him go to a friend's house. I think it would have been even worse if I'd just made it home before she died. I thought maybe her condition was just being kind of a bitch but I thought it could have been my dad or I could've been able to see out her little face. I guess she just kept coming back in and saying, 'Why don't you do something that makes my mind go to pieces?'"


So thank you. That said, I have to ask, why would someone send me this video but I'm a big fan of you? You're so amazing. Just, you and I are so close. I am so really psyched to be on stage with you and be working with you again.

I'm sure this story can be repeated many times. I wish I could explain what I saw but for the life of me, I think it is not worth the risk to be there with you. Your fans and your fans of music (or at least that's what I think of them) will say they are amazing but what happens if I let them say they are too loud? Can I be on stage for something? I love you, do you have some idea where you live? How many times do you have a song that you love called "Be Yourself"? Do you have some other song to share with the crowd
