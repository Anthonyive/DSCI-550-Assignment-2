Hi, Stop lying! I'm going to use my IQ to arrest you! has just worked out that I may be "hacked", but sadly no such cases ever came about, so I couldn't ask you to help me fix my problems. I hope you will not be upset by my decision, as I really appreciate your friendship and care. You will be able to buy my clothes for them from my store in Liverpool in the future.
So please, let's all make a big heart out for me, because I couldn't be here without you. It's so heartwarming to see such a great friend of mine and family, one who was extremely lucky and who always thought to try, but who eventually left and had to go back to another place because of the financial crisis. I know that many of you were wondering what I had done because I was there, but I know you were also able to keep my heart intact, so please do as much as you can for me and for all of those who have lost their lives. I thank you,
I know that in the future, I will continue to be a good person.
I always appreciated all that you have done for me and I am so very sorry for the situation.
Thank you to everybody who had helped me through this journey. I appreciate all you have done for
