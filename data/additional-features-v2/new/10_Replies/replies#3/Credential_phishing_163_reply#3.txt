YoHey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. can do more to take advantage of that uncertainty, whether in the short and medium term or the long term. My view on the BKNK investment model is this:

"It is a reflection of my position as a highly regarded independent member of the Bank.

"By working with the Bank and with my colleagues at the BKNK Asset Management, we have successfully achieved a positive development of UK asset management and the Bank is looking for ways to bring the Bank back into more effective strategic role.

"Given the complexity of the sector, it is impossible for me to comment on whether my view is 'yes'. I would like to reassure the BKNK Group that we understand and appreciate the challenges, the opportunities and our core asset management work and want to work with them.

"If they choose to go this route, I will be making clear they should be on the same page with investors."

Pending formal comment, a spokesman for the Bank's board of directors told Daily Mail Online: "We are pleased to hear your concerns on this matter."

"While the BKNK investment model is a key part of our mission to support UK economic growth, its fundamental role is to create a world that works for everyone,"
