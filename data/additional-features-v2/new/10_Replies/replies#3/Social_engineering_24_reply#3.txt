To whom may concern, I've located your ip address.r ip address. There are three of you, and each of you, have my e-mail address, and therefore you can send me any mail that I need from you, even in the worst of circumstances:

Please take care that I have written to the address I've assigned to you.

I wish you luck when you go overseas.

I thank you for coming and I hope that your family and I feel that the world is more beautiful and vibrant when we arrive here in the UK from this great country. I know that from a distance from the outside world, and on the day of our arrival, I would be glad to know that we were here. So, to you, I'd like to tell you I have received some very special things. I received my first white wedding ring and this very special one.

First is the most important piece of jewelry I've worn since childhood.

I want to thank my sister, sister-in-law and my little sister for all the wonderful things that they do for me.

The other very special piece is my favorite piece of jewelry.

I love to wear a wedding band and jewelry, as is the way I dress when I am gone.

You've been very kind to me.

It's very special to me that you've come here.

I appreciate it for all the wonderful things that you do for me.

I feel so blessed that you've come to this country.

And I understand that you haven't really had the chance to experience many of the things you've done.

Yes, I know I've gone overseas and I've done lots and lots. Yes, I've been here for a long time.

But, this is a country where everybody looks at themselves in a positive light.
