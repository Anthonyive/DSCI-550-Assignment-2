Dear, I've located your ip address. group who have not been aware of or fully understood the situation? This has been an ongoing question and I think you did so clearly in your letter.

I would agree, it is an ongoing question.

With respect to that, what were the responses and when, and where were you aware of those responses and where do you think that you would want to meet them for their response?

At the time, I received assurances.

What about what else were those assurances? What about you not knowing and trusting that your relationship with the United States of America would be in fact one of stability and the continuation of the cooperation and mutual understanding between the two nations? Would you have taken those assurances and stated clearly that you would be met, and then you would not have expressed these things again in any way?

Well I do think it is important to give people a clear understanding of your situation, and this is something I think you did.

It is important to know that you were not asked to do this or to disclose this information. You would not have had such a clear understanding of it had you not given those assurances.

What were you told that you received or knew? Did you receive or know anything about it at the time
