To whom may concern, I've located your ip address. As a result we were prevented from continuing to be able to talk to them in relation to our counter-terrorism mission.

There was a sense that we weren't going to be able to talk to them to know what to do next, so we took the matter to the Director of National Intelligence, who is now a senior deputy, and he said there were no problems.

If you had any information that might help clarify this case, or the situation that it might have been possible for our counter-terrorism team, I think you can ask your question.

The intelligence department is here for a reason. It's not that we want to make a name for ourselves, or let an officer think we want to play a big role. We know who the target is, we know we have an objective, but at the same time we would prefer not to play at the expense of our own national security.
