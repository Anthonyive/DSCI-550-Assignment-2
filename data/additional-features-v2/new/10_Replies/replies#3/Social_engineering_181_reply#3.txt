Hi, OMG I'm so lucky! by Sir James A. Macdonald.
Now, however, as I pointed out in another letter, the reason why he took this job is because Sir James Macdonald was the most significant banker that ever lived.
He had not only given his backing to a political party, but also to the right to rule, which led to the British-Arab War.
At the time he was appointed Secretary of the Treasury he also had a major role on the front-line of the British civil war. The United States had already been in the process of withdrawing its troops from Syria because Britain had just intervened. But on 9 October 1917, the French army moved in and captured Britain.
That is the role that Sir John White played with his banking empire. He became its Secretary in October 1914 and a leader in bringing about the European Civil War which took place in 1920.
But in 1918 he took another role and became its Secretary in 1925. During this period his banking empire was transformed from an Anglo-German business empire to one which was essentially owned by the British Raj and its members.
The Bank of England was one of the first and most powerful money centers in the world.
