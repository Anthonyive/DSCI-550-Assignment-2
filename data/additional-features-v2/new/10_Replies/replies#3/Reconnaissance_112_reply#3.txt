My husband and I still live in the same house today (with new kids).

My husband is very upset about some of the other kids in my family. His father's actions are always very difficult to understand, and many of the kids live in poverty, with some of their friends and relatives who live in different areas. My wife always tries to talk to him and makes clear that she feels nothing for him, that he will never forgive her, that she needs to leave him, that he will never be able to leave her, that he has problems that need fixing.
