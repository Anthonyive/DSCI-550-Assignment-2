Hi, I'll let my son help me. son help me.

Today is the first time we have been together so far, and I love it so much. I get so many pictures, I can't even imagine them all in one moment. It's a very special day for me, I will continue to remember how blessed this place was for me to be able to visit that place, I was so excited to be here, and I just can't wait. I love you and thank you for the kind words.

Sincerely,

Dennis

I ended up finding the entrance to the
