Hi, I've located your ip address.r ip address. I didn't know what my ip address was... I had it and it was a Google Account. So the reason I think I have you on my computer is because I have seen a few websites asking you for it. You can call me at 704-826-2850 or toll free 1-800-902-4111 or by clicking on the "Call Us" button. I do not use any private email service. All I do is read my email and if you want to go to "the contacts page", you can do so from my home page or web browser.<|endoftext|>
