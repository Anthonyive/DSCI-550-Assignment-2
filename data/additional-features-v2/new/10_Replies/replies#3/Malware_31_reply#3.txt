To whom may concern, Your computer has been hacked. been hacked. Do not worry, it's fine. If you do, you will be returned in time. Now, let us examine the facts carefully and identify which people are responsible for the intrusion.

There is already a public discussion of the government's attempts to monitor "top secret" communications (for example, the NSA's National Security Program). The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently reported that they have been able to identify at least 10 "high-level" people, "including people named as associates" with "intrusion" to the US and to the "critical infrastructure of the United States." Of the top 10 in FBI possession, 19 out of the 20 were "allegedly top secret information."

The top-level people being "alleged high level" by the NSA is obviously these people with connections to Russia's government. Since the NSA is doing all it can to "protect" our citizens from an unprovoked attack, it makes sense to start there.

It was the right thing to do, but there was only so much "time" and this situation became more challenging when a number of the top officials on the Russia-related team were apparently involved in hacking "critical infrastructure."

There are two basic factors involved here, though their names become even more interesting when we turn our attention to these senior official.

First, what does the alleged "top secret" information reveal about these top-level "top secret" people? No. They were not mentioned
