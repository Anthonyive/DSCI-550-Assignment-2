Hey,You have been located especially as a result of my work helping the homeless. In particular I've seen a tremendous increase in the number of people who know my name (see http://www.dollhouse.org/fundraising/help ), and have been receiving a lot of donations from all over the world, which has given me tremendous pleasure to work for. I've helped hundreds of homeless people reach their first donations of money. They love that I'm here and I have no reason to not give them a chance to show us what they can do to help out. Also I know this may not have been an amazing first week in charity, and I want to give them a chance.As we continue to improve the situation in Greece, I hope this will help raise some new funds, or at least help get them to make a donation with their support. We could all just live forever. Thank you so much for your support.We will see you soon to see where this is going.I'm doing quite well for my career, and I will be going out to see my family in Athens at the end of the year. Thanks again.Your support will help so much.And as we continue to improve the situation in Greece and make things more accessible and livable for everyone in Athens
