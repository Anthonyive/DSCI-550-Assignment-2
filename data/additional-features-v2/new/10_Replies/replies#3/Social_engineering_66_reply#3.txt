Hi, OMG I'm so lucky!I'm so lucky! I'm a 3rd generation Windows RT 8 Pro and I've been running my tablet for about 18 hours now and I have no issues getting it out of my pocket and into my hands. That being said I've been using the tablet all day and I know some people will tell me there are times when the problem seems to get worse but it's nothing personal...It was one of those days where I had to leave the device and go through a lot of manual work. But this is definitely something you do not want to do with a Windows device you might have a lot of issues with...You will not be able to run the app unless you have a rooted Windows device...Your tablet may have to be turned off to do that because when you turn the device off the screen will go back to the original brightness. I don't know if the problem is with the brightness of my tablet or if it's an issue with the hardware but I am hoping some of you who have tried your tablet can let your computer know you are using the right software and don't have to leave it. Thanks for all your support guys!!I got the device when I went to work yesterday and I was getting about 90 min of free wifi. My computer is working fine but I think I may have to do some internet research before I can send it back to the retailer. If anyone's going to help me out with this please do so in the thread on this thread so that I can get your help.
