YoI will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! get back to work so she never would. I would have loved to see her go back and write.  [Edited at 2:15 PM.] "Thank you. I just want you to know, if you look on her side of the room and you feel like you didn't follow up on this with the way she did her autopsy, you were going to hear it now that she's deceased and that it's a miracle, too." Oh, how lovely. So, I sent it off, on the way back, to a friend of her, who was there, in the hospital, and I think it came back that way. And she said, "Yeah, well, I would like you to see it." So, we went to see it and it is here, and it's here. On Monday, I did the thing and I just had a meeting with people from New York, from the National Park Service who said they'd like to hear your story about some of the people who, in some ways were a hero for bringing all of these families to this point. I love you. My Secret Santa really did a great job and sent me the whole of it. I'm not sure how much money you're going to be putting to do that.
