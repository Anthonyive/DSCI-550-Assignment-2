YoI will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! when it becomes necessary to do business with an overseas bank.
I wonder what he received from your company, or any individual from this company, as far as the federal funds are concerned?
Mr. Eisner's company also reported to Austria on the account at the Federal Bank of Austria.
However, no one from your company, either directly or indirectly, ever claimed they had received these funds as evidence to this effect.
The Federal authorities in Austria were unable to verify the fact that this was in fact an Austrian bank account to do business with you.
They were unable to verify Mr. Eisner's claim that this was not a government account to receive foreign money.
To my knowledge, no bank in Austria receives any foreign money in return for its services or investment.
To my knowledge, in most European countries, foreign money is considered to be a form of international financial aid.
It is the official currency of a country and is accepted in some Member States as legal tender, in all international transactions.<|endoftext|>
