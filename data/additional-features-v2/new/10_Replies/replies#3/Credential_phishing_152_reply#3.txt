Hello, You want my bank account, I'm having trouble turning the computer on. Can you help me?. I informed the embassy in Saudi Arabia of the meeting and arranged for his presence at the meeting to be informed by a committee of the King in charge of the foreign ministry. It would have been difficult and time consuming to travel to Saudi Arabia and get such a clear idea of all the facts, such as the facts about the country's affairs, about the foreign affairs of the Saudi states and the country's relations with the United Nations, but after his appearance I began to prepare the meeting that would take place in the foreign ministry.

In the course of my preparations I realized that I was not able to give a proper response to the minister of the King in Saudi Arabia. It was during this time that I received a message from my minister's ambassador in Kuwait inviting me to meet him in Riyadh and to set up a meeting with him that would take place in his presence on the 14th and 15th.

After meeting him it was discovered that the delegation of the Kuwaiti government was going to meet with him on the 16th but this was not permitted. Thus I told the embassy in Saudi Arabia that my position on this matter would change on the 18th and 19th. I wanted my representatives to be present at the meeting but I did not want the meeting
