YoHey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later..We help people with health and hygiene problems in the UK.For many years the main employer that used to offer services was UK based Care Quality Authority. We are now offering services for over 5 years now.We do not have any staff available to assist us in the search for clients.We have done a very good job.If you are looking to look for a new business, our healthcare team will be available to you in London.The food and healthcare industry is so big that some people have no idea what they are being charged.We are a local family friendly business.We are based in London with a focus on providing the best UK food and healthcare. All our meals are done at a local food centre for the NHS.We make sure the UK is healthy for food and medicine.Our current business is set to be started and we will follow the business to some extent for future operations which means that there will likely be many jobs opening.We make sure we get our businesses up and running within a matter of months.A lot of our customers are people that have never been to the UK before, but we will get on with our business.I hope my post was helpful. Thank you,The Health and Wellbeing of the UK. If you would like to help
