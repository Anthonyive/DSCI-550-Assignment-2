Dear, Do you really think I would believe in this trash?n this trash?

I wrote about it back in 2009, but I really doubt the story's real story. If your average Joe goes to the polls, he likely won't get more than eight of the 30 or so votes left and is in some ways not qualified to be in the race. Even though he's probably still in second or even out of the race, I don't think he'll be a really good voting bloc or representative of the Tea Party, or an organized group, and this guy makes me think he doesn't really know what he's talking about. (He'll never even try to tell me this story, but if I have to bet on it, that doesn't make it any less of a story.) And here's a key part of the story that I don't think anybody has heard. It's from last year's Iowa gubernatorial race.

The idea behind this story began in 2011 as a joke at a local restaurant in Long Island, where a group of friends were playing in the street and saw this man at a picnic table. The group said "hey," and one of the friends, who was watching them, pointed out that this man had just gotten out of jail.

"We didn't want to go home with him, he had to come back home with us. That really scared them a little bit. We're not saying we should have stayed home, we're saying we'd be pretty darn nervous, especially if he was a kid. We were just having fun and being nice to him. He kind of fell on hard times. He did some very big things for a cause. And it took about three years of trial to prove it. I think he eventually got out and worked up some really good courage."

This is a joke, right?

The joke was in the 2011 elections. The question is: Who is the next person to go into jail and "go home" with as a thank you note for bringing to your face a life of crime.

I've been doing this for a long time now and I think it's time for Americans to stand up and tell Americans that we're actually more concerned with that
