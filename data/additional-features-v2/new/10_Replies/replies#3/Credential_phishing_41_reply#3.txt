Hello, Do you really think I would believe in this trash? I am going to start my career as a journalist and I don't really care if my work with Mozambique is over. In the past, I spent my life in Mozambique, but that has really changed. Now, I need to make sure I maintain my reputation. There are people in Mozambique that are very much involved in our country's history that have never worked in Mozambique. That's not good news for me. So when I'm finished with my contract with Mozambique, I will definitely take this money. I need to take my name into consideration and take notes so that I can make sure that I get a decent contract. This is not just about money. It is also about my personal, working life, and my career.
But as for me, I am not going to make any mistakes about my life.
If there is a person that should be considered as being responsible for this situation, why should I lose my job and get money? I am a journalist, and I should have access to the truth that is very important for me. It is absolutely important to me that they get a fair job and make me live as happy as I can, which is why I would like to take some time away from this
