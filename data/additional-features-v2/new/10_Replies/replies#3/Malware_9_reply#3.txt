YoStop sending me requests for my account so early! make your life miserable or anything.  I don't care what your life is like for you. You have no future.  I'm not ready to give you that. Don't worry, that's not my problem, and I'm not going to make that life miserable by paying you.  I'm making that money. This is what I'm going to do if you stay here. I hope you all will find out I am still here.  
Don't ever, ever forget that it's your choice to make.  If you want to live your life a happy one, then don't give in to the pressures of being rich and living an awful life in this land.  You'll never find someone who will do you justice.  Look at what you've done to that, and the people who supported you, that went around to help you.  Don't pay the bills...don't live your dreams.  When you start making your dreams come true, you will see.  You will see that you're actually living a dream that's true, and you will understand you have choices that they don't seem to get in your head, and you'll not let the pressure get the better of you
