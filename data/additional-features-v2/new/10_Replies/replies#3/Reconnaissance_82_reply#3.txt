Dear, Do you really think I would believe in this trash?n this trash?
I feel the same way when I hear this stuff. I don't understand why anybody would believe it. A guy at a college gym named Kyle is doing just that. This kid is totally dumb, and I hope he just stopped and decided to make up his mind as soon as possible.
It all reminds me a little bit of how I always say this before a lesson. When you give a kid free reign to make an argument against an institution, he knows that's his way of dealing with it, and you'll be okay.
This goes all the way back to the day before I started to do this, as we all know from time to time our kid will say stuff like "my teacher told me to stop talking and move on". And he's going, well I can see the pain here in my heart. I'd actually have felt the same way. The idea of not realizing that "the idea of having the free will" was a stupid idea was like a bad joke. And so in order to give free reign to the other kid in line, you have to just keep trying to get him to change it.
And that's what I think about from time to time. It's like I'm saying: I want to know: if he really wants the ball, how did he make the decision to do that? And he just did that and did a dumbass job of trying to make himself feel good about it, and then proceeded to move on with his life.
And now, I'm here and I'm trying to stop this kid from doing that. I just hope he doesn't do that.
And so now, I want him to get some free reign to do that. That's probably what I would want for him, to show people that he's
