Hey,Do you really think I would believe in this trash?n this trash? And you're probably a little worried that that means you're not a good fan of this shit. This is going to take awhile to wrap up. Let's get started!

Here's a small hint that would help get to the bottom of this: I've been enjoying playing around with this all week. In the last couple of weeks, I've started seeing my playtest in the latest 3rd party mods. Some have found their way to the Nexus, others on Steam but most haven't even seen it yet. But I have seen how that works out. I'm playing on my 2.11 build and so far this is my main build in the first game. I'm using my modding experience to get a feel for what I'm making and have no idea what I'm doing here. For example, one of the first steps you are going to want to take is to get more involved with your modding experiences. I have a lot of experience playing D&D's forums but I haven't played WoW, so I won't be able to get a good handle on what is going on with these games, so I'm going to be the first to say they are being played with an unusual amount of skill and expertise.

Before I get into the details, I wanted to share something that you all know (I have a bit of an extra to say about it but I'll save it for another time): As a rule, I play D&D's forums daily. I do this on a regular basis at the forums but for your convenience I won't actually go into it in depth here. I will leave it at that. It's about a game, of course. It's your decision. I have a ton of information I will share here and I hope that you enjoy it too.

So lets talk about the information and why you all love my mods so much?

What makes up ModDice and DND?

MODDICE and DND use the same D&D engine
