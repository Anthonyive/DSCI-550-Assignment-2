Hello, I'll let my son help me. son help me. He had autism recently and I am unable to read at all and he was diagnosed with autism.

I need his help in getting him a normal brain. He needs to make sure he is taking medication like ACE inhibitors and so on

So there's some sort of therapy or therapy and then I can get him help with that and we can talk about autism and autism issues.

I am really overwhelmed and I need more therapy for that. I have to find my own voice in his mind.

In the next couple of hours, I will send him the following message, it's simple, please don't let my autistic son grow up and ruin my life.

I have been working on this for over 5 years now and I still do not know what therapy is.

What can you do?<|endoftext|>
