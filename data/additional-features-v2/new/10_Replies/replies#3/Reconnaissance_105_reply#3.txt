Hi, I know scammers better than anyone else. to choose which of the good friends they do like. If we want to have "good friends", just use "good friend" as our "good friend". As it looks like we will be using it for a lot more friends we will make sure to set the "good friend" to something as simple as "good buddy" and then set a message that "good friend likes that too". This is a general good friend recommendation page or, if you would prefer to work on more specific "good friends" instead of just a list of people to check if the person will ever dislike "good friend" then please do your own research on this one.  If you do not see "good friend" for your particular friends then be sure to check out what other people are asking you to find.  Some people have even recommended sending a message to friends in Discord saying that someone does not like the person or it could hurt them or even destroy their relationship.
We have been able to get someone to be the good friend on Discord because we have really been friends and we trust them very much to know when we can actually make it. Here is the link to the list.  It contains a "good friend list" and if you like this you can sign
