Hey,How can I get the money?et the money?

If you're a regular reader who's checking out my blog, I've prepared the basic info before you start getting the money. So, it's a step-by-step guide to getting the money you need in your inbox.

1) Read the instructions carefully

In my case my first step for getting the money was my first paycheck from a job site I've been working at for over 2 years (thank you to our great manager Lisa for putting this info together).

Before I go into the details of the instructions, the first thing you need to do is start working through all the required details. This will allow you to save a little time to focus and get started. The money will come with 2 payment details, one for me and one for my supervisor. These two are the same one.

Next you need to use the cashier's code to make sure that you can find your full pay when you register your account, and the payment receipt to make sure that you receive payment on time.

I've found this to be a lot easier than I thought it would be for my average day. As I found out later on, when I first signed up for the company, I was just like, "I can't do it, I've just got a little time to spend and I want to use my first paycheck."

This process is called checking, and so it makes it much easier. Now, if you're worried about making a mistake, read through the instructions. Don't worry that one time it might be the wrong number.

3) Pay all the expenses (e.g. gas, phone, credit card, food, electronics, housework, etc)

While you're checking out the website, you can use your credit card and debit cards to buy groceries or make reservations for your next event. The best way I found for doing this is by going to Walmart or a local fast food place where you can pick up groceries without getting charged. This will make it much easier, and when you do it will make the difference.

Pay all the expenses for the first 10 days, and then buy the groceries with credit or debit cards. The savings you get from this will be split equally across 10 days
