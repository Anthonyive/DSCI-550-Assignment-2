Dear, I need to verify your identity and I said no, he took it as a joke.  I never told him anything.  I never told him that you were trying to get me pregnant.  You told him I made up the story to get him pregnant.  We spent lots of time kissing, so we knew how the heck you got pregnant.  When I told you he was happy that I did, he was sad that it didn't work out, because he told me to shut it out of his life. He said that he was in love with me so much that after he'd tried to stop sleeping with me he asked me to go and stay in the car with him, and when we arrived in his car he told us he never told me what he was going to do for me. He asked me to go with him but I told him to stop sleeping, and he told me he'd never tell me about anything and that he could not tell me anything at all, so when we walked on to the side of the road he told us to get down to the main road at night and get the boy out of bed. I didn't believe it, but I was very afraid, because the first thing I did was I said to him it was no problem
