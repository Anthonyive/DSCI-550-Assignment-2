Hey,I don't have my own computer, could you buy me one? of my family. That day, I went in and told her my story, but it was like no one cared. I could only believe her.

My sisters and I were just two months removed from my best friend's death, and now two of them and I are still here with her. I hope that her stories and her legacy will be an inspiration for others, and for those who know her.

One last thing is that my brother is dead. He will be missed by many, and many more. I will miss him so much, and my family will never see him again.

I pray for his many supporters, friends, coworkers, and those who were there to hear his story and be there for him. He will remain with us every day, forever.

I love you for being here, and for that, so much.
