Hey,I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! and my wife. I've been dealing with Donald Trump for 5 years now but he has changed all the times. There have been no signs of change for 7 months. The reality is you have been using me. That is why I know that you really understand your situation and appreciate your time and support. We hope that this letter has served you well. It's clear that you understand the circumstances and you appreciate my support, the family, the staff and my entire office. That's why you are not concerned about us. We have had many people have spoken with you that are going through a similar situation. I was so overwhelmed by the response that I made. You are a wonderful father who always knew his things and he just told you what to do. I love you. Don't you care what Donald Trump does to you?
What's troubling me is your family's attitude about me. This has been happening so many times over the past year. Our daughter and my son were born out of wedlock, which is a difficult experience. I told you, My best friend, to help her find love. That is what I've told her many times before. I am sorry that there is anyone in my office that has not felt the same way. I am sorry
