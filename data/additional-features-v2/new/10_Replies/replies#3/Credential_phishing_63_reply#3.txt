Hey,I know scammers better than anyone else..

I am not the only one who has been offered some opportunity by the government to help out him. I am, however, hoping that you can help me in giving some consideration in my legal case which relates to your personal rights as an Australian citizen. Thank you.

I am going through the same dilemma: I can not do anything for my colleagues with regard to employment matters, let alone a legal matter where I have more than 25 years as the head of a company.

My best friend has been asked by the government to take a seat as a partner on an investment firm; I am hoping that he can offer an opportunity.

And you know what happens when my friends are forced to accept jobs in other countries.

I don't want to go to the trouble of going to their home country of a company I had so much influence over.

Please do not hesitate to contact you.

Thank you.

I will explain how to answer your question.
