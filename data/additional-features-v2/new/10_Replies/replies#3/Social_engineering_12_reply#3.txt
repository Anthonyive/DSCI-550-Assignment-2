TO WHOM NO MORE WILL ANYONE Mourn The Day We Were Born.

"The Day We Were Born": A Prayer Day.

In the USA, there are 8 national Prayer Day traditions, each of which is dedicated to a particular event:

The Day We Were Born:

"The Day We Were Born" is an event dedicated to the life of one's parent, guardian, custodian, grandfather, grandmother, brother, uncle, great-grandfather, nephew, aunt, brother, sister, niece, nephew, and uncles. On Tuesday, October 13, the prayer and memorial day will be at the National Ceremony.

The Prayer:

I was born in the land of the free, with a future and a promise.

The Day We Were Born:

I was raised on an ancient, white, Christian family. The day we were born was the last time I ever saw my father alone in the cradle.

We live in a land that no man ever saw, but God has given us the courage to look back and understand.

The Day We Were Born:

We are part of a global community and that is the Day of Our Lord.

We live within a nation where we live in the same land where we always have been. I would like to request the prayers and prayers for all that are in this country to be addressed respectfully to you.

The Prayer:

Our Father's Name are forever with Us, Amen.

THE SAME DAY A.D.

When the Almighty created the world, He created our world to be perfect. And a few days later, the Earth, as He said in Psalm 18:17 (John 7:1), changed.

So God created a perfect world, and now the day we are born is the day we are saved.

There are many things to remember
