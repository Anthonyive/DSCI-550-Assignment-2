Hello, Stop sending message to this email address or I'll call the cops! Â It may never be done again and it might be a lot more useful to the child that it be done. I know I know I will never come up with the kind of response I was expecting. So, I am writing to ask that the Lord give me a hand this time because I have read your letter and know you will be great to you and your family and will bless you and teach you how to get by.<|endoftext|>
