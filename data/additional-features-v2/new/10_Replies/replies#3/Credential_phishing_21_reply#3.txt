Hi, Call me at 911.ll me at 911. If you're just getting off the phone, your call might be off for an hour or two... But let me tell you, it's a very basic call and if you don't feel confident to call, you probably don't want to miss any of this. There are 3 lines of service from your cell phone number. Call 1, 911, or I'm waiting at your door or at your office. Call 10, 519, or 830.


From there, you know your call should be heard - call 1, 911, 830, or 2 and say goodbye. Then, you're good to go. (Don't forget to leave a comment for updates and to start a conversation with the person you're talking to.)


The next time you want to go to your local emergency line, give a shout out when it's time to dial emergency.
