Hello, Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later.etails later.Thank you for the answer, it is for the love of my life, my very deepest thanks.I have been living in the world of anime from the beginning of my childhood. When I was about six months old, the one-dimensional dream I had of an ordinary American girl came to a crashing halt. I was in high school and I remember the first day we were together. The dream was a big one. My younger sister's mom looked at me with one of those cute eyes. "Mom!" Her beautiful face and her face made the whole dream all the more impressive. I knew what my sister was up to. The only person who knew about my dreams was the very person who asked me to talk to her. "Yes? You are in love with your very own mom, even though you are really not related to her?" I was so excited to meet her. My life had never stopped on so many different levels and my sense of myself was completely different.I didn't know what was going on but something that I knew was happening in me. What was wrong with me? I was on hormones, so I had to know what was going on. I told her all of my previous dreams. The world told me I had to go to bed. I cried a bit so I could rest a bit while doing things with a little strength.It didn't feel nice when I cried for so long, but I finally had my tears. I looked at her, and as I went through my dream I had to face her face like a beautiful man. I couldn't believe she was so adorable, but I wanted to say it's ok!I was so happy to meet her. "You aren't related to her, you are with your parents. Just because I'm very different doesn't mean that she is a bad person." She said that her mother was jealous of me. I didn't understand, but I was so happy. I cried for two hours. I was so happy to be with my family
