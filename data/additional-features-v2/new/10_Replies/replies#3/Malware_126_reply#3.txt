Hey,Stop sending me requests for my account so early! talk about this, we could put it away. I told him, "If I see anything in my book, or I see something in your life, I will stop using the Internet so I don't have to do that again." He told me he'd put things away, because I don't like that. I asked him, 'What did you talk about? What did you think about, I don't like you coming to my house.'"
I'd heard about that before.
(Later, we spent three nights living in my apartment; and the next evening, I gave my phone number to a friend of mine. It was his sister, who I got to meet at an apartment. She was very cute.)
Anyway, I told him about my book. I said, "You're kidding. That's like, in any big town, you'd think this guy would be here if you had something like that. But the guy just kept trying to drive me away.
He says, "Well, I heard you were a movie star and did a little bit with Ripper Ricks. That's what I did. That really sucked. But you said you never see a book without a kiss on the lips. Then you get your money back.
