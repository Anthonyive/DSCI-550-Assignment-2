YoYou were a young baby when I was a huge scammer, boi :) to know the status of your letter.
When I received it last week, I did not have the opportunity to examine it. I have given my explanation.
I understand that your Department of State had told you in July the matter would still be for review, but you did not reply before that time. You sent the letter only two days ago, and you did not respond to me.
I do not believe that it is likely that the matter of the letter will come to an end as soon as you are informed of your decision.
If any questions arise then I shall try to explain in the affirmative. As far as I understand, the law is not clear on how the President can make such a decision.
Mr. Speaker, if I might proceed to make further statements in respect of what the President has said.
As a matter of this matter, you cannot make such a decision without receiving a letter from me. You must inform the Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary of the United States that I will take no further action in relation to that letter until you have received it.
I understand, however, that you are aware that there is an issue on my part in respect of the letters it is sending to the Attorney General and to Senator Graham of
