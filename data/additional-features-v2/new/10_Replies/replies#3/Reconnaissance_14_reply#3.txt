To whom may concern, I don't have my own computer, could you buy me one?u buy me one?

We could make you some money with it!

When we were young, your parents paid $40 to upgrade your computer. When they retired, your parents paid $100 for it. My parents paid me $200 more than mine, so I can get an old computer for free!


Does it work?


Not sure if you can get that money. I really don't want one. It's just more expensive and more complicated than you think! It's not something you want and I think you'll rather buy something else for nothing and have it, rather than spend all that money on buying something else.<|endoftext|>
