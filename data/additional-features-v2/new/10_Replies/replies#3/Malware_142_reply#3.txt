I have a Pikachu with my "Pokemon" and the "Pokemon" that is at the bottom of the screen appears to be a Pidgey. I like it. I'm afraid it's all cute.


There are a bunch of pokemon on there, like I'm saying "hey, there's one that gets you pregnant. This is my baby boy Pokemon" and a Pidgey. I've got all the other Pokemon in here, so why not try and go over the top one? Well look at that one.


Do you think I'm stupid? Yes you are. I know.

Ok, you can't get all my
