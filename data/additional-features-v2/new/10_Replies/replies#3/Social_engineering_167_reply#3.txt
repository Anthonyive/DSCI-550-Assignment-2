Dear, Stop sending message to this email address or I'll call the cops!. The two of them had gone to the airport and was supposed to make the next trip. But after a couple of hours, they called out to me.

They asked if I want to talk about the news of this. I told them that I had gotten my passport and that I wanted to travel to Paris. They said that if I went, they would let me in, and I would be happy in the United States. I tried to have no dialogue with them after that, though.

The last couple of weeks I was very concerned. I thought about what my family had done to our country, and I had to go and meet with them. I had gone to the airport, I had asked how old they were, and they said that they had lost contact and there was nothing they could do. I made my way to my cell phone and there were five calls, which were from the last couple of days, and this call said that all of the family members had left their home, in some form, and the police have not heard anything from them. I have decided, now that we are going to the United States, I will take care of this and prepare myself for tomorrow morning, as I did in the hospital, and so on.
