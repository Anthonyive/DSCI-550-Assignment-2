YoHey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later.,

due to various problems at work, from the bank and from

them.

Thank you for your reply.

There are few things which can prevent me from making

any further calls and calls to tell you what I've done.

Although there will be some minor things to do, I do not have

any problems, and so cannot leave you as you are.

Therefore, I have decided to make an appointment for a personal meeting with

you to discuss my situation and find out what is going on.

Please do not call me without first calling my

advisor or the manager.

Thank you for your reply. I hope to give you a thorough answer

that is a full account and that you will do the things you normally

do. I have also decided to take my advice regarding

your money, and to make sure that you know what

I am doing with it. Your attitude towards

these matters is exemplary, and I hope to understand

your request. Please leave this matter as is.

I thank you for your reply. This is very important

for me.

Yours sincerely.

I hope to
