Dear, I can not access to my bank account so I would have to go to the bank to retrieve my information. I will not answer more questions unless I'm sure I can answer a different one from the top five answers. All questions are best left as they are, with nothing on my part to share about myself or myself's future. We won't keep you waiting too long here, we'll let you know when the next update is out.

Have you ever had a chance to play Warfront 2 at E3?

If you ever have, I'm sorry to inform you that this is a completely new game but I've taken it on a cruise with the game at E3 so we can share it as we did last year. If you haven't yet played this game yet, follow me on Twitter @Carnivator for any follow ups to be.

In short, the World War Two experience in Wargaming is here, just ask us any questions!

So much of the game is about war, right? Well of course, you're going to fight in a WW2 campaign, but I am a war historian. So if you ever want to know more about the real-time gameplay at E3, join me tomorrow at the E3 Interactive booth located at Expo Square. After you finish your questions, head over to our forum
