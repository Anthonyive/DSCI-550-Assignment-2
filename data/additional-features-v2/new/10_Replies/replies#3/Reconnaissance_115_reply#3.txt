Dear, You have been located a fixed wage. My employer did not offer to provide any compensation for me. I will probably have to return my clothes and my work clothes to the employer.

How much does the work?

The work is very simple. So if you would like, you will pay the employers one-third of the salary of the employer. And the other half is covered.

What do you say if you need money for a job?

I was paid about $13/hr. Now the employer only pays me $1/hr. Now if I go on to work, they do not even ask me to go for an interview, not even to pay me. My employers are still trying to do the work. You still have to find the money. If I have a working contract with no problem, all the pay goes to me. If I do not ask my employer to pay me the money and the money goes to my family for another week or even three months, that's the end. The time is only paid when I can no longer afford to stay with my family.

What do you think of the experience of working at a restaurant or a store that is called a hotel or a restaurant?

I love it. Every day
