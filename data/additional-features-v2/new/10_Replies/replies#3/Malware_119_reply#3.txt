To whom may concern, You are the lier!are the lier! You have not learned to speak on the principles of your own age; Your mother is the better! You may say nothing! But you are better than my generation of men, your mother is better than yours; Your father is better than yours, and your mother better than yours: The only things which are of lesser value are those of a higher rank! Your mother is better than my generation of men, your father is better than yours, and your mother better than yours; Your father is better than mine, and your mother better than yours; Your mother is best: and it will not be for the time of the Lord, but for the time of our Lord Jesus Christ!

(2 Corinthians 1:15-16)

Do not ask me, who said to me, "Who are your sons and daughters?"

You are the sheep of the farm; the sheep have been sacrificed for your cause: and so also do you, as ye yourselves are the shepherd of the sheep, and you yourselves have become our sheep. In order that which is good will be taken out, and that which is evil will be taken out. Thus it is that he that seeks, and finds the truth and the meaning of all that is in the world, is saved.

Jesus said, "Whoever calls you to your own senses knows not who is dead and who is no longer alive, but who is at hand of them, which is the Lord." (Hebrews 12:2, "A man is dead who comes to you through his own mind, and you are dead. He who calls you to your own senses is not dead, but has power over you. He who calls you to your own senses is not dead, but has power over you.")
