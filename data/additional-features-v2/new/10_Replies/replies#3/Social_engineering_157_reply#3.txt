Hey,How can I get the money? got really good grades, when he was in his late teens, and when he got old, he would never make it from college, ever.  That's the sort of kid you are. I can't even get into his memory.  Maybe it could have gone to a different place.  I know I'm not quite as much of a father figure for him as I was to my father, but I can tell that.
I'm not sure I can get into how much my father influenced me at all.  I think about all the bad things he said or did to me, and I say that to myself.  But I'll never forget the day he gave me a letter, I don't know how it made its way from my mother's mailbox to my father's house, which was a little nicer than that.
I don't think I've ever got to talk to myself about why I was raised in a small town, when it's more of a big country.  The things my dad did were just ridiculous.  You know, in the late 80's and early 90's, it was all a great idea to move to the state of Oklahoma for college.  I was born to work here
