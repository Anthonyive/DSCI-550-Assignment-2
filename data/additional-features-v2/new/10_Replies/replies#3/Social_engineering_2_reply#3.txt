Dear, Do you really think I would believe in this trash?n this trash? How could you be so upset over that if you are not even from this planet? The question asked is not "Which one is it?", but "Which planet should I live on?" If you feel that you do not like the name of the planet that you live in, then you are here to tell me that you do not like the name of Earth. If your planet is called "Earth", then you do not want Earth to be named the Earth that we live in. You have nothing to fear from your own planet. You live in the universe of which you create your self, not on another planet. There is nothing to fear you from any place on this planet, not here or on your own planet.<|endoftext|>
