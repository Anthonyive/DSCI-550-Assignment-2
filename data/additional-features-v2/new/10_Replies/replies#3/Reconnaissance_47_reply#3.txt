Hello, You want my bank account, I'm having trouble turning the computer on. Can you help me? which is a coordination of the two National Disaster Management Centers, has begun preparing their efforts to help those who have already fled.

It is estimated that more than 150,000 people have already been affected, and up to 200,000 displaced individuals.

The NDFMC, which will provide financial support, will also assist those affected.

"The first priority will be to help the families of those persons whose missing loved ones have been found within a two hour time limit. After that the first priority will be to help the survivors of those remaining at the damaged locations. Then the other priority will be to ensure that as much as possible of the survivors are protected from harm," said Mr. Barreto.
