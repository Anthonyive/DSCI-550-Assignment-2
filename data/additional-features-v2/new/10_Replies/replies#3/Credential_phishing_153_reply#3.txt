Hello, Thank you so much! at the picture that I had in my computer, which indicated the boots were at right hand side.  That's when I knew that I'm the same person as the shoes he saw the boots on.  He even wrote a post on Instagram about the boots to send to friends or family. He sent me the post and I just wanted to get in touch and tell him what happened.
His son got in touch with me, he sent me a few pictures, and he told me that he'd been talking to a friend in Japan who was talking about a pair of hiking boots with him, and a friend of theirs.  He had one of the shoes that the two of them would have worn at school.  I didn't know if he'd ever heard of that before, but I got this.  They had the black color and had the back. I was going to do a quick review, but I just got it the next day.  It was a nice little piece of new design, and very comfortable.
The shoes are slightly different from my friend's pair of boots, but they are well made for walking, climbing, or hiking.  They're made of natural materials, so they can be worn down.
