YoI've located your ip address. conflicts, the rules shall not change.
If you feel that the game is lacking in any other aspects, let me know and I'll write this post to help you solve that. If you feel that the game is too "boring" for your liking, feel free to ask.
Please note that, while I have this set of rules, it is not a rule book with every step. Please understand that not everyone likes to spend an hour playing the game. It is not always simple to get used to. It will definitely not be fun playing through this.
If you have any feedback, please reach out to me at ommyc at any of my e-mail addresses and my e-mail address is on my page. I will then try to respond as fast as possible. I will take whatever step is needed to get this information correct. If something happens, I will do my best to respond promptly, as I always do that.<|endoftext|>
