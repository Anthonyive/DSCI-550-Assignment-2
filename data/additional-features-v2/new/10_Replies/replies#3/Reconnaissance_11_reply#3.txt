Hi, Stop lying! I'm going to use my IQ to arrest you! all this is that we, as robots, make things for people. We provide people with goods, products, and services, that they can buy and use.

This is very exciting, and I'd love to hear more about it.

So what is robots doing?

It is easy to see why this is one area of research that you need to consider, as well as one area where roboticists are having their first significant work.

Here are some examples of what we're doing here:

Automation for the blind

A project called Transmitter and Vision Systems (TVA) is a group that has developed a system for tracking a person's vision using a robot called a device that can communicate with the device by using infrared. This gives the blind a better insight into the location of what's in front of them and, where, and how they see, than would a human eye could. (The idea behind this is that it will help with information gathering so that humans could read a book or just follow a walk.)

There's much more to it, but I can tell you it's about as exciting as if we were working in a hotel lobby.

And while these robots do things you would normally do
