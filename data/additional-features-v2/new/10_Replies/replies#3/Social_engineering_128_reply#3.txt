Dear, F**k you! to be in a military city like this to have an opportunity to help. You can be in Aleppo and you can live in the countryside. You can also have kids to care for and to care for.

Now, you can have the opportunity to learn Arabic through a doctor's visit, but that's still not that much. We don't live in Aleppo yet. But here are people's families who have lost their family members to this war, and here's a generation that has lost their kids.

Now, you know that I believe that that is a great thing that we have the ability to do. When you have a new generation, they're very, very excited, and the things that have come through on a national scale, that will be good to see. And there's a whole generation of people that have lost their families because of this war. It's an incredible achievement, and a great opportunity to help.
