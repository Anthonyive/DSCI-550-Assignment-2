Hello, This is too hard for me.. "We need policies that can help address the carbon crisis. The last thing we need is one that we don't have to get involved in climate change."

The goal is to produce an "envelope of action" to help the world take a step forward. As climate change worsens, these emissions are likely to rise further – even further. The UN climate agency predicts that more than 4 million more people around the world may experience a loss of at least 0.5 per cent of their food production in the next 50 years and that the amount of carbon that would be emitted is likely to double in the next two decades. More than 120 countries are on track to hit what are considered to be catastrophic emissions levels, such as by 2015.
