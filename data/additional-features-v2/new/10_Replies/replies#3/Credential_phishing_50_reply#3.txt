Hello, My SNN is 123-456-7890.123-456-7890. How do you keep it safe on my phone!

I have no idea what it was because I don't know how to protect my phone from a phone like this. My SNN also just calls from another device that I use a lot - so I'm afraid you know. I've found that my phone is not only so damn scary and extremely small I actually have to do what I do - call in and have the tech tell you what it is... and this is what happens when you type in the name of your SNN app!
