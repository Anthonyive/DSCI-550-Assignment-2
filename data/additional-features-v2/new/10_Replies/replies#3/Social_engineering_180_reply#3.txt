To whom may concern, I've located your ip address. they have been told that they could die. We have had a terrible time.
Your parents have given you three or four hours to come to the hospital and talk to you. You will know that there are a lot of options, there is nothing like it.
I have the privilege of being an English teacher in a major metropolitan city who has taught here since 1977. My husband is a psychologist here in the UK. He is an expert here in the study of psychosocial behavior.
I have the privilege of working in an environment where children are allowed to come here without restrictions. And, even though you have done this with us all our lives, it is not something that is permitted in this country. And I think that it will be hard to see the problems in our culture if we just stop talking about it and do nothing.
And that is why you're here. We are not going to let you make your own decisions with you.
Because your parents will tell you. They tell you that you need to work and that you will have to look after your children. And, if you don't have the mental capacity to speak to them, then they tell you that you should not care about the children, that they are not allowed to see them
