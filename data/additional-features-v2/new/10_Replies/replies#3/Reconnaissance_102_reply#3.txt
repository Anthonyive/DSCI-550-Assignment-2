Dear, F**k you!ar, F**k you! If you don't understand, I don't give a shit.

The world, from a distance, looks like something like this:

"A woman was carrying a large pack of bananas into the air in front of a group of kids at a festival.

Another woman was carrying a large pack of bananas into the air near a police station. A teenager's backpack was left there unattended. A child took a picture at the police station, with bananas. A backpack filled with the bananas was left in the street behind. A man's foot was left in the road ahead of the police station in front of the police station, with bananas. In the middle of the street is a child's walk-in refrigerator with bananas in it. In the background, is a bus with fruit and banana juice in the background, with bananas on it."

Oh yeah, that is the point.

Here is the quote that was used for the entire clip.

"There was probably a 20/20 of an adult who was drinking heavily and drinking heavily on Tuesday in front of a large group of kids in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station in front of the police station
