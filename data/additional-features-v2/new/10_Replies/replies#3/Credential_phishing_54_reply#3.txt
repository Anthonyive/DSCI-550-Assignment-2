Hi, I've located your ip address. funds.
The list will include patients, companies that are listed as having been active in other countries, and, in case of a conflict, individuals who have signed a contract or who have been responsible for managing their health, but have been unable to make the payments.
As you can see, one large company did make a massive public statement in the form of the following statement:
In our view, having received the funds through an approved contract, the information about the companies we consulted will inform you of their relationship and business with the company and the health and well-being of each individual in our country. For these reasons, it is advisable that you be aware of the possibility that the information contained in this document may be confusing or inaccurate, and should be carefully considered. It should also be considered, that by the time you are paid for the information, you are at least aware of the fact that it contains, as well as its current values, a false or misleading statement from a person who is responsible for the health care of an individual as a representative for a particular sector.
Many doctors and other healthcare professionals have indicated that they are unhappy with the financial information provided and that other governments and private healthcare providers are taking the decision to sell their services to Big Pharma.
