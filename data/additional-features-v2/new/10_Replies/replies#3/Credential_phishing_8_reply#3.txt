It seems to me, for the first time in my life, in a long time, that life itself is a question of meaning. I had a very narrow focus to begin with, and in some ways this was like a book-end to my life, because that's what it is. There's nothing else and nothing more important, there's no other idea or life, and in that way it works out. What it actually does is answer a question I had for a long time: what is meaning.
