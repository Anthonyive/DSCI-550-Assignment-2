Hey,You are the lier! that make up the people's hearts are the people that come first when it comes to the big prize. They come first, not people who come next.

Those that came first are the people that bring our beautiful country together. Let's go in solidarity against the poor people.

We have never seen a nation that has felt the need to make a statement or do an act of courage. We have seen that all of us share the desire to fight and unite to win. Let us not fail to make it possible for us to be there.

Let's not forget that the last time we heard a person call me "the leader" we were talking in front of a camera while he was marching back home in his white robe.

We can only do our best to stand up. Let's do our best to carry our fight. Let's do our best to overcome people's fears and be the strongest ones.

Thank you for your courage and sacrifice.
