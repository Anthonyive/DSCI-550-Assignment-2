We've released a new update today. With it's update, we've moved you to the game's website (http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/106540-my-favorite-blunder/) to take your game to the next level.With the update, you'll be able to download the beta and run it with this link: http://beta.blunder.com/. I personally have a few things I'd like to make better.1. Get a new title.I've seen your game so far. I love getting new things and it's nice to see you excited about the game and the new features. With your support, let us tell you more about your game with me to get it on everyone's radar before release.2. Add some extra content, like better support for custom content. You don't need to add any custom content. I want to hear your feedback on what content you want added.3. Include your beta title and your feedback, so they'll know that your game is coming. Let's be real: It seems like there's a real need for a new title.I'd like to see a few changes to this beta, but for now, please give feedback for us to consider
