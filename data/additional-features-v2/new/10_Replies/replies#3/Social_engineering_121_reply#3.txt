Dear, Call me at 911.ll me at 911. This is the one place I think I have been, and that is how I know my mom is right. You just called me at 9:42. This is how I know that your daughter has been right.


If you call 911 today, and she is right, I'm sorry. If she is wrong, the call's been answered.


If you call 911, and she is wrong, I'm sorry, too. If she is wrong, the call's been answered.


You have asked to be treated right. I'm sorry for any disruption to your communication with my wife.


I have called for help. I've tried to be as patient as possible. You have done a great job. You've raised money for my family. We both have lost and the pain and the frustration is over.


But I have to help get her home, and she has never been that way.


And if she is wrong, that's fine. But if she is right, we have every right to take her home and I'm sorry.


What we need are you and I. Because we are the one that deserves to be treated right.


"Don't believe what she says." -Mother.<|endoftext|>
