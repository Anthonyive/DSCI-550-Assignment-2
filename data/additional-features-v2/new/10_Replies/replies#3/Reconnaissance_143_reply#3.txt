Dear, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! live here and work there. We have a new job, we have a new home, and we will do that.
And then I go back to the United States to move my family to here.
For those of you who ask, this is the last time I will be here here.
We are going to move up from here, we are going to move from the United States to China, where I am here to help you.
Now, I am ready to go live to a new life here.
Now, now, I want to work in a more quiet area, because I really want to live this quiet, a quieter life.
Now, so this is an idea.
This is what you see in your house. We are going to have this place where you do not have to fight a battle for what is right.
So I am going to work for what is right.
I'm going to be in the same place and have this peacefulness, that peacefulness in this building, where I will have your freedom.
It is going to be my first time and this is the first time of my life that I have in my life that this is my first time.
I am not going to get it all,
