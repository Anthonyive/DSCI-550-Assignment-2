Hi, You want my bank account, I'm having trouble turning the computer on. Can you help me? an important contribution to the lives of so many.

And you're also a good father. I do wish we had gotten some other family members to do the same.

A couple of people are like, "I'm not going to get off in this situation and we're going to put some people out of it, we're going to get out of it and we're going to let these people know and we can talk about them if we want to and it can help to help them with their careers and families."

What about children?

What about children? What's your view on children?

No.

I would love to put that out there, but I can't.

You don't want to be held responsible for the deaths of kids or kids.

Well, I think we all do too.

What about the other families who are affected by the war and the military, they're not responsible for you.

Yeah, it's not their fault that the military took all the money and so forth, but those people, I think their responsibility, they're going to look for their kids or their families.

And, you know, they're going to look out for their best
