Hey,I'll let my son help me. general, if you get your start as an architect/project creator, you can learn some of the various types of programming concepts, the syntax for which is pretty basic and how to build them, and then get the most out of this experience.

In order to be aware of the different types of MIND2 MODDING you are going to need, you may want to search the MINDMODDING folder in your Project Control or your application control for something that you can use as an interactive editor.

For the example I am using, I want to make the game 'Dedicated' so that I can play it with all the game modes in it, in order to see what effects they had on the game at some point.

The MINDMODDING folder contains these two files.

MIND2MODDING.cpp - contains code that you can use to open or open the code that is in this folder.

MIND2MODDING.x86_64.dll - contains code that you can use to open or open a file in the Visual Studio project that will open an X86 project into C#.

MIND2MODDING.x86_64_64.
