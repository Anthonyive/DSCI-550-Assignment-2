Hi, Call me at 911.ll me at 911. That's good to know! We're still at the airport to pick you up at my hotel and waiting for you. There are 2 buses for passengers, both take 2-7 minutes to walk to the hotel, take 3-10 minutes to get you there (you'll have to book the 2nd bus, then bring your own, you don't want to take the two buses on your own and charge your fares), and have some beers and some snack bar at the hotel. Check out what to expect before you go…

To get from Los Angeles to Philadelphia, you're going to have to drive 4 minutes to LAX to pick up at my hotel, and then take the 2-7 minute travel to Philly, and then stop in Philadelphia for dinner. Once you're finished, go to Philadelphia for breakfast, and then stop by my restaurant to get something to eat. If you aren't hungry you can take your time for breakfast or dinner, or just hang out with friends, while you wait (or hang out!).

Here is my full itinerary…

We're going to stop at the Trestles, the main drag on the Strip, at the intersection of Route 93 and I-70, and the parking lot will be packed down there. This will take about 10 minutes, and I'm glad to have you around for dinner, so please get in touch, and we can try to pick you up in time to pick you up at my hotel and wait.
