Dear, Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later.etails later. I know you might have a lot on your mind but why not talk me through the entire process? I am already talking a lot about your story and why you are so into it. I'll be sending you my profile of the person you met online at the time. I'll also send you some of the information I will be sending you about the person you met via Skype! Here, I'll show you exactly what I'm trying to convey. I'm actually just saying this because it is what your profile is about: "The guy who met you on Skype. He made a really stupid prank on you. Did you think he was a man because he didn't want to be photographed by strangers in public? I don't need to be embarrassed. I just think that if you can get me some sort of help then I can help you out." Oh! I'm sorry! I think the man's name is Yvonne and she was born on a farm in the mountains of eastern Russia, and she's already got a boyfriend. You know how she is so cute to me? She has her hair down to her waist and her hair gets shorter and shorter until she's a little taller than me. I thought we would have a nice relationship. I just did not see the end of it! You guys are really into each other! I can already see the way you enjoy being around each other so much. If you'd like to add further info you can go to this link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt014640/ Yvonne is a beautiful blonde woman with small hair and pale blue eyes, and a smooth, soft voice.
