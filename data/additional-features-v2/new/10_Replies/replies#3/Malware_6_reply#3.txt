Hey,My SNN is 123-456-7890. can do, of course), because it seems to be a dead giveaway.

Sincerely,

Dan (and I'm not sorry).

My name is Dan (and I'm not sorry), and I am looking for some advice.

Some kind words:

If you're wondering what sort of writing process my writing is in, I hope that I would write it in some way that's consistent with my other writing and hopefully give my story something to write about.

If there are any questions about it, you know that I want to hear them. Also, if any of these questions will help you in the future, it's pretty much going to be appreciated.

Anyway, I am willing to give you a few of those suggestions, so please come to me and let me know what your thoughts are.

I may be sending you an email as soon as the post is up.

Thank you!

Dan (and I'm not sorry).

Oh yeah, and my sister, too, is a writer.

Dear, Urgency Alert, please answer within 2 days (the best you can do, of course), because I want to help you out.

I hope that you
