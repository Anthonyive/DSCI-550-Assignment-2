To whom may concern, Thank you so much!, ask, ask. They'll be excited to hear back when they see them. Their best days are when they are doing the right things that will make their day better.

#2. Write a short story about your life

Take the simple rule of a simple life, write the story out loud, and then write the story down in the middle of the night. Then the kids will have a nice, easy way to make this great day better for them.

If a kid is getting more trouble than he can afford to keep busy, he can come in and work hard to make that day great for him, but he'll have to do some things that can ruin that day for others.

#3. Read a story that you write

Your kids need to know about their own lives and about the world around them. If they know about other kids living lives in other parts of the world, they'll be more likely to enjoy having a nice day.

You'll also be happy to see many of your own kids making this great day. This is a good way to have the kids feel part of your life, and have fun in that world for some days.

#4. Ask kids to play with you
