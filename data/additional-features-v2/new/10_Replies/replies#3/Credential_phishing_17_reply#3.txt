Dear, I've located your ip address. many people out there that believe that that's what is necessary, and that I believe the federal government should continue the investigation.

But there are other issues, I would ask you, we need to get this right now.

If we didn't want to do that, we could have had one more hearing over the next week to sort of know what was going on here. We need an independent investigation. And so we need to begin that process this year.<|endoftext|>
