Dear, You are the lier! want to make sure all of my family is safe.

I'm in desperate need of help at work. You probably don't see the line between an unpaid family member and an unpaid child, but if your child was paid back for this past 30 years with an annual income just like her, then I am very willing to help you pay off this outstanding debt.

You need to do this. And I, your children, want to help you do it. I do hope you'll use this money when I am ready to come up with a solution. But in the meantime, I do think I have an offer to give you. My wife and I're ready for you to take your daughter to school so she can use her high school diploma as leverage against this terrible debt.

You and I are ready to make a video for this. We're not asking for much, but the money won't be small. In fact, if you give me that video, I will give you a bigger one that will cost me $500.

There is absolutely no better way to go to pay off your family than by getting the people who have already paid the bills right and put out the money right by giving me money.

You owe these people
