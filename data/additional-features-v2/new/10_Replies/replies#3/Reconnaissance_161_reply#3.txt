My heart is heavy.
A big part of my life has been watching football and the Olympics.  I always wondered if the game was just too difficult at my age. I always wondered if there was something about football that made it more of a challenge and harder for people to get to play and improve. I always wondered if they ever showed me any signs of that. I never wondered if there was an extra motivation or motivation for the players and coaches to try and help you all. But of course, the thought of that didn't matter. But sometimes that thought was too much. It didn't matter who was getting the ball and getting it back for the next or if the ball could always get to him.   It mattered more. It was as if a guy who had a passion for football wanted me to be the main man. Maybe that means I have to go around training and trying to do things different and try and get better at all. Maybe that means I have to be a little more like this guy because I'm not the guy that's just going to make the play. Maybe that's because a guy doesn't have to try and get to a certain level
