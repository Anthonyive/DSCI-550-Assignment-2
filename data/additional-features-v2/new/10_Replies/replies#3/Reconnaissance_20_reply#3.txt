Dear, Your name is C. S. Anderson. We're about the same age.

I'm the younger brother of Erika who has a little sister, Saren, in common with your sister.

But, I also have a wife, who I have two daughters (3 and 4). I have a brother, whose name is Kevin, and has a younger brother named Kiyoshi. So, you two may have two kids, and both of them will be children, but, I'm not sure that's necessarily a viable scenario.

So, now that you're both alive, what do you need to say before you can use this.

Please understand that this is not a long story or a talk about an alternate Universe of people, but a different story. And, you're probably going to start doing some of the things you do in that story anyway.

My name is C.S. Anderson, and my brother Kevin. We are two of the longest of our siblings. My father is Erika's younger brother and I live near a military base, where he works. I was the only one born into such a family.

I had never been before, and was pretty sure I wasn't going to see anybody. But, we were so close, that I'd known my dad a long time before. And, my brother and I were fighting on the moon. It was a very, very scary experience, to be in orbit, be on the moon, to be with my father. The first time we met we didn't want to talk about it, so we were pretty sure you were my brothers. In fact, I always felt that the first time we met was when my father and his wife got in the way of us. We all started to laugh a little because it made me feel very, very, very good about being with you.

As we were walking down the street, one time, we saw you and your three friends. They
