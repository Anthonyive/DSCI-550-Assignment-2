Hey guys, I was just following my friend from San Francisco to check out something. This was on Monday, September 22nd and there were two guys who have been here long enough to know me. I said to them a bit before that that the same type guy would not be with us and that it would be fine to meet. I was also looking at the same group of guys at the hotel on Tuesday as well. The guy who was visiting the other day said that we would need some guys there and that they would be taking it out on a few other guys. At some point we were headed out to the hotel to check out the rest of it. Well, it was a good idea and our two friends were a bit nervous. They kept telling us that they didn't want us there or that they wanted to come stay with us. We were told we might have to make our way along the streets or walk up to them. The dude who we asked if we wanted to stay was a gentleman in his forties and said he could come up and give us his info for the rest of the night.

That evening we found some of the other guys. They said they thought it would be alright to be with us if it was only for an hour or two before they went to the hotel and I asked what they were up to. They said that they will be with us next week and if we are ready to take on another group of guys, we'll do that, but if we want to go out with someone, I'm afraid the guy who spoke to us would probably let us know. I knew it was going to be very hard.
