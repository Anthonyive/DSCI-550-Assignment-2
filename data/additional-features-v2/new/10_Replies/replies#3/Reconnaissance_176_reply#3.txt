Hello, I've located your ip address. compromise.
We have received the necessary technical, financial and technical support and the management of the company is now satisfied to begin implementing the proposed guidelines which have been agreed upon by the BIS.
In the meantime we will continue working as a team to ensure the well-being of the business.
And I know that your family and your friends have a very strong commitment to making sure our company works for the common good.
I know that your father left India in the 1970s, and since he is well, you might remember him.
He had a lot of friends living in Hyderabad where his parents grew up.
But in 1980 he moved from Telangana and started BIS.
The whole family of his would go to the BIS every year for training.
When the move to BIS became apparent, his father died in 1996.
Many of the older brothers and sisters who had been training at that company were retired.
He was unable to continue training under the current BIS.
It is important that you get as many people as possible into the business, so that they are able to support you.
With your help we can complete our contract for the technical, financial and technical support for our company.
Thank you very
