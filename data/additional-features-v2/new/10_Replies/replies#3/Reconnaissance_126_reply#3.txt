Hey,Stop sending message to this email address or I'll call the cops!all the cops!We received an email from a man, who claims to have been beaten up by a police officer. The man said he and his brother had been leaving this evening after leaving a bar with the two friends.This man said the woman who had been talking to him as he was leaving said she got into a fight with a cop, and started punching him and other people because of the fact that her brother would get out of bed early for work and drink.This man claims to have a long history of violence with the police, and that he was part of a violent gang.It looks like the police are going to arrest a guy in cold blood for posting his criminal record to Facebook and trying to find revenge on his alleged gang members.<|endoftext|>
