Hello, Thank you so much! we went a step further by telling others to join the discussion and making sure the discussion would move from the business side and into the community. The feedback we received from the community and community members was fantastic.


When I received my e-mails of advice, it was very exciting. To my surprise, I received a good response from the company and I didn't have to worry about leaving or becoming unhappy with the company. I also got several comments from the community that wanted to see me start a company and to create a good life-experience by becoming a digital entrepreneur. I believe this community of people from all over the world has contributed and helped us in every way we could and will keep up the tremendous feedback we received from it.

Thank you to everyone for coming through our meetings and I hope to see you continue to grow and become a successful entrepreneur.
