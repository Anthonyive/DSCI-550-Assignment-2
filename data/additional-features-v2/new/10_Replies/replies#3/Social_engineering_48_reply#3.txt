Hi, Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later.etails later.I have nothing against you, because I love you, but what is most important about us is that you are my friend, and that you have made me want to spend some more time with you. I have been looking for it to be like this for quite some time now, and now it is here. I was sitting on my couch, I remember it from that day I left my job last night and was going to go spend some time with my family. It was time for me to leave the house just as my wife had left. I saw her outside. I saw it all, I saw how much she had said about me that night. She was like "we can't believe you're still here". I looked at the stars. I said "sure". She said, "I'm afraid it has nothing to do with my job or the rest of my life... I don't want you to wake up crying with me thinking about me, I want you to know I'm going to never, ever, ever forget". I could hear her voice in my head. I don't know why, but when I looked at her face I couldn't help thinking, that she was thinking about me all the time. And I knew that she was talking about what her life will be like when I return.And that is why you are the greatest friend I've ever known, so I hope that you love and know me from now on, don't you!? No, no, don't be afraid of me, I know that. You will love me because I am so happy that you are here. I want you to be happy, you can't say no when I ask you something, just let me see you
