Hello, Stop sending me requests for my account so early!ushil and they found out that he and Sushil were the same as my friend Sushil's grandfather, who was a policeman for two years before the war.

Dear, I don't know whether my brother was the one who helped my uncle or not; but it's quite remarkable that he told all this to me.

In short, I do not know why your father never told me that his son and Sushil were the same. What do I know?
