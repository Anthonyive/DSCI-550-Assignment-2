Hi, Stop sending message to this email address or I'll call the cops!all the cops! I'm tired of hearing those annoying butts from the back of your neck who don't want you in their homes. Just stop telling those little shitshits that you're scared of the world, and give the fuck out and keep quiet!

This is not about you. Stop sending messages to your "friend" who doesn't want to hear from you, and don't say that you think she'll be ok with your presence if you move in and live there anymore. Seriously, don't bother getting into it with anyone else because I won't let you make the mistake of moving away from home because I'm not even going to tell you that you should be able to get away without someone to protect your privacy and be like "oh, I'm not going to hear from you either. I'm fine with you staying in my house because I've got a very strict policy of not letting any of the friends of mine in here know. And then of course, you can move back here and not deal with her. I won't let you leave. And then no one's going to know. You can't be around. You've been there. You've been there. You've been there. That's it, don't worry. I'll call her next time I want her safe from you at 2 PM and she'll have to come out, and she'll know where I'm going. I don't care who I send these little shitshits to.<|endoftext|>
