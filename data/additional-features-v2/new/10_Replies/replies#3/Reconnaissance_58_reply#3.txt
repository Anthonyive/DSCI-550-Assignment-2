To whom may concern, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks!tion? Thanks!


There were at this time no plans to change any player at this time to match the standard of "no substitutions," but for that matter it might be possible to modify the roster of "injured" players to make the position more interesting.


You could do this by placing a player to the "pre-regressed" roster and letting him sit in place for the rest of the season and add the injured player back to it.


With one game left until the next playoffs, you would also do the following:


Pick an injured player and add him back to the team and return him to full strength, which would allow the injury to play until later, which would give the player a shot to rest on the spot.


This would mean adding players like Ryan Williams, Jay Feely, Michael Bourn and a couple other free agents that the team could buy in for good money. (Yes, you can do that. You can still keep the injured players, but you'd have to let the season end until he is back.)


I like this idea but, by the way, as I've said to you, it does involve me having to sign all of the teams in the league that would like to trade down for him. For that matter, would you agree that I would have to make the trade if this were a possibility?<|endoftext|>
