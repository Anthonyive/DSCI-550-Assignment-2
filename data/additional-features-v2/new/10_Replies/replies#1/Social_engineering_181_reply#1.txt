Hello, F**k you! of Switzerland. These three people, who died under very unfair circumstances, were very very wealthy.
I am sure that there are people who would not go about buying and renting homes and still be quite rich.
This is why I am a very close friend of Sir Edmund and of Sir William Woodard.
A great many people have died under many unfair circumstances and will not stay for too long. This letter is for you.
Sir William Woodard has died and I want you to be the next of kin of Sir Edmund.
I want you to be aware that you will not be able to pay off the loans you have been asked to provide for by the Sion family. These loan repayments are due on the day they are due. I ask you to take these loans with all possible diligence to support the family.
This is why I have also presented this letter to you to prove that you will be able to pay off some of the loans you have provided for for the last seven years.
The only way to take your money in two years is by taking the money that has been deposited with the Sion family in Switzerland and depositing it into an account with the Swiss bank account. I cannot prove that your trust funds are your bank deposits.
