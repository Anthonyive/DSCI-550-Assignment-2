Hello, I don't know.  now, it seems that American police are turning a blind eye.
This goes beyond spying on innocent citizens. As I wrote yesterday, an official in the US DOJ told the Times of London "This is an extremely sensitive matter" and pointed to "the widespread presence of US law enforcement officers and foreign intelligence operatives in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other places where Americans may have information pertaining to terrorism threats from countries that have intervened".
And, the New York Times reports, the Department of Justice in the US is now "coupling its counterterrorism efforts with other counterterrorism efforts with key states such as Jordan, Kuwait and Morocco".
So what about an attack by the Muslim Brothers on an American school?
It seems that American police are taking the first step toward shutting down the Internet and blocking any or all of the information coming to their attention that may be exposing American criminal activity.
I mean, we're seeing all sorts of anti-American protests, like the one in San Francisco that was hijacked by right-wing extremist Muslims.
And yet, they're acting as if we are, like, our government. It's like if it weren't for the fact that the Bush administration basically said, "We're not going to shut down the internet for a while.
