Dear, You have been located pay the mortgage and will fall off the market by December 31, 2011.
It will depend on the situation of the people who were paying this money. It is only because it's coming from your banks that this money will fall off the market. The loans they make to you are also taken into consideration. The people who gave the money are also subject to this risk and I need you to be very frank about the fact that I am doing this because I want you to understand that when this money is due for payment and it has been taken in by the South American and African banks, we will not be able to pay for it again.
That is all. I want to take this money out of the hands of those who gave it, to the banks that will handle it. I want your friends to have some of those deposits. You can help me sort through that. I need you to bring this to your attention. I need you to be very candid about this. If this money stays on the market, I believe there will not be anyone who will get it back. People who gave these money are then given their mortgages by the people who were paying this money. If there is a market like that, I am going to do my best to help you find
