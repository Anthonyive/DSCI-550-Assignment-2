Hello, I can't understand what you mean by that type of risk did you expect to have (with no risk)?
What kind of cost would you expect you were willing to pay (in a normal business setting)?
-What costs would you expect to pay if you were to take the loss on a short, normal business trip (like a business tour) and then move it to the suburbs?
-What cost would you expect to pay if you took the loss on a full-length (and full-length business trip) travel?
-What cost would you expect to pay if you moved and changed hotels?
-What cost was you expecting to pay (to change hotels? or to move an additional person into a hotel in your area)?
-What cost was you expecting to pay if you moved an extra person into a hotel in your area? What cost was you expecting to pay, and what cost would you expect to take in the new person? And this has a lot of negative side effects.
-What kind of business would you choose to deal with? Would you continue in the same type of business after this?
-What kinds of risks do you think might need to be taken in order to make this business viable?
-I can't speculate on these, and that is for your
