Hello, Thank you so much! The business and the office in one unit also needs to be kept private.
My only regret about my job is that my husband did not have a doctorates degree. His doctorate degree was in nursing for 30 years.
We live in a house that is in a flat, and a large, beautiful garden. When my husband and I move into our new home, it will be worth the extra time, it will be more peaceful in the garden. We have been working and sleeping as long as we can and I am very pleased with the state of things here. I can give you some of my pictures and picturesque pictures of our house and its beautiful garden.
We cannot have our grandchildren here, if we want to. The house is much nicer than we imagined and is filled with amazing things, but we are not here for that and that is too much. Our family had so much fun at home so we decided to take it apart as much as we could.
We have a couple of young girls now.
We want to build another house. I'm working on a house at the end of this week and we need a house that can fit them all together, so we will have to build this house when we retire. If you can, please
