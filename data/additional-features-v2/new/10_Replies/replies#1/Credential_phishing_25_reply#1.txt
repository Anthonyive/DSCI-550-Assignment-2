Hi, Do you really think I would believe in this trash? kilowatt hours of electricity by 2020.
The project is to be part of a six-speed transmission line connecting the A.B.A. to SEDC.
The project is expected to be completed in two years and I am willing to invest in one year to get that done.
My question is how can you help out the consortium which owns the Cascadia power plant?
To start with, I know they won't go to the US, but we have a lot of experience working in South Africa, so it would make sense to move up in the United States, where it would be more difficult, and help us if possible.
Kocha, as with all projects that have to do with infrastructure, this project does not even have a human element.
To be clear, I am not a politician, I am a non-entity who has been paying my dues for the past 12 years of my life.
The first two years were spent working in the government office because I have no experience.
In fact, I work for a non-government organisation and for the SESDCC. They have a contract with the SEDC to build the new power plant. It is their business to build the new power plant
