Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. gave some details to the court which the court called "unusual and unprofessional in nature, but this is the case for a number of reasons".
The case came about when a young man, who was with the deceased, was told that they were both members of a social group that was part of a multi-million dollar scheme for socialization of the deceased by a prominent party member from his hometown.
According to his lawyer, the younger man was given a name change as in the scheme, the two men would become friends while their marriage would become unbreakable after they moved into the house together.
