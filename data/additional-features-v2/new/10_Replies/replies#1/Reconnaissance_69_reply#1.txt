Hello, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! being able to use this local government agency/labor to provide their services and to provide their employees with the goods and services they need from these local government agencies.
The contractor has provided the services and hired the employees.
It is expected that each local government agency/labor will take their time to get these local government agencies and their employees to execute the contract.
According to the contract, the contractor has to pay the final price for the work done by the local government agency/labor.
If the contractor doesn't pay the final price, the contract is void because the contractor can't pay for the work done by the local government agency/labor at all.Â 
A third important aspect of the contract is to maintain the law by working to achieve compliance with the law and to create a public atmosphere of cooperation in order to achieve the contract.
These three aspects of the law are the basic obligations to the contractor and the provisions that can be fulfilled according to these core obligations.
If the contractor is doing anything other than maintaining the law with the purpose of obtaining compliance, then the contract is void.
