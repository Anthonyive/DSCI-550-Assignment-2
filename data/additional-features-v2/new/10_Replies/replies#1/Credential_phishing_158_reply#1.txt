Dear, Do you really think I would believe in this trash?).

The first payment has been made payable to an Australian corporation to support

all operations conducted in Australia.

The second payment has been made payable to the Australian government to pay

for the Australian development expenditure.

The third payment is payable for the Australian foreign aid expenditure.

The last payment is payable to the Australian Treasury which has,

according to the regulations, "a right to control, for its own benefit, the financial

services and activities of foreign governments". This right has been

contracted by the Australian government to cover these expenses. It is worth noting that

the amount of payments made to the Australian government does not equal any portion

of the total costs covered by the contracts.
