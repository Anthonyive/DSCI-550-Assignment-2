RE:
This company is the owner and it has been well under the control since 1997.
This company is now running this business in India. It has become extremely rich in terms of the services it gives to all visitors and its customer base and I am convinced that it will remain so.
To be exact, what is this business doing here? There is only one place here that my company can get its money and there is only one place it can afford to stay in.
Now it is going for 500,000 rupees. The company doesn't want to spend that much money here and I know that the money is needed to get everything. If I say so, I will be the only one who can afford it and the company will be able to buy it.
It's my business and I don't have any worries about anything else.
I will take care of the shareholders and I will continue doing business here even if the government wants to keep it in.
Thank you for your letter. Thank you.<|endoftext|>
