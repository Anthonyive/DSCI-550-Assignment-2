From:
The fund will not go away.
Your support will be crucial and will be your chance to live up to your mission.
We have already talked about how to set up our fund on the big banks, I'll go over that in detail in a bit.
We will not go into detail about exactly how the funds should be set up but what we need to do is create a special trust with this bank,
We'll make sure we follow the correct and safe procedure for setting up our money to this bank.
This trust will start out with a bank account and that will then be converted into a foreign bank account which will have the funds deposited directly into our account.
The fund is called the Dutch company.
The funds will be deposited in a personal trust where the money will be put into the trust.
This will be held to make sure there is no temptation from people to send their money to the funds in this trust.
