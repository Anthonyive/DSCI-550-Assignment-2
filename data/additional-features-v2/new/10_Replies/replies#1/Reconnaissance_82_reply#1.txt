YoI've located your ip address. my wife, and her family has been given all the support they need to continue. I am willing to help out any way that is needed. It is important to keep the family financially intact to gain financial support. But I still want to keep my husband in the family for their benefit. But also my children will be born without my supervision. My sister was also unable to stay with me in Singapore after she died last year because she was unable to support them. Therefore, I cannot afford to spend more than 10 times my salary for medical care. I would rather help my children because their lives are better with me. I am currently in this stage of my career so I do not have any problems with my medical practice. I would ask you to know that I am working hard to develop relationships and my family.

Thank you for your time.<|endoftext|>
