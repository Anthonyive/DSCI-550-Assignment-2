The Ministry of Commerce, Industry, Justice and Trade have confirmed to me that this is an order. This is an announcement of the appointment of the person responsible for ensuring the health and wellbeing of the people of the Philippines. The Minister of Commerce, Industry, Justice and Trade is Ngo Dinh Diakite and will work closely with the Minister of Commerce, Industry, Justice and Trade to ensure this is the case.
The information in the paper says that all the provisions of the "Chinodong" order for using the Chisok in the Philippines are not included in the official document or in any of the official publications. We want to ensure the safety and well-being of all the people in the State.
