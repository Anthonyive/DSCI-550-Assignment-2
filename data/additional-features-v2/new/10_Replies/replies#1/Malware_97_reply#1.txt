Hi, Stop sending me requests for my account so early! since 2003.
My name is Mr. Paul Thomas F. (Betsy) Dingle. You can see my website at http://www.golanstlouis.org. You may email me at PaulThomasF@gmail.com to be included in my list of "Friends."
You can read the entire statement of Senator Dingle from the Board of Governors of the St. Louis, Missouri General Assembly at http://www.gr.org/general/laws/state-governance/st-la-state-politics.html.
I'm glad you have taken a stand against the harmful anti-science and anti-worker legislation passed by this State. I hope you see how they are affecting the health, safety and well-being of Missouri citizens, and of businesses and individuals in the state.
Please join me on Facebook, and Twitter at @stgolanstlouis, and in your comments section below, and let us know what you think of the provisions in this bill.<|endoftext|>
