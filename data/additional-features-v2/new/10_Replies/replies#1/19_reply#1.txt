Hello, You want my bank account, Iâ€™m having trouble turning the computer on. Can you help me? British soldiers who have been killed in fighting the Indian army during our Indian war are under the moral responsibility to stand up to the British. I want you to stand with me because you are under the moral responsibility to stand up to the British so that we can protect people who have suffered in fighting for independence and also to defend ourselves from aggression and terrorism. We need to speak out against the war that has been waged to overthrow the British government and the British have been complicit in its crimes. I will speak out when I am allowed to do so, for my rights are not respected and people may think that this is a good idea but that does not mean that people should be scared of British soldiers and other Indian soldiers after knowing them. I am not speaking out because in fact that is a clear demonstration that all of us are fighting for our rights. I am speaking out because if any soldiers from any of our armies do not come to us and make any comments or say anything that can be considered to be derogatory and offensive it will be regarded as disloyalty to our government. They will be ostracised, they will be treated as petty, they will be subject to ridicule and all the soldiers in our government know that the British are not willing to stand up to these kinds of
