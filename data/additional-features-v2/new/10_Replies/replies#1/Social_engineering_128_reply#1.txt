Hey,I've located your ip address.Cecilia. I have been late because the marriage was late and the son was not going to be with me.

But even after it was over, I still felt a bit sad about it, and there are people who are trying to get the divorce, and so there was this sort of weird thing where I asked my spouse about things that had happened as a result of her separation. I said, I'm not going to believe that what happened to my husband and kids or our family was my fault if they left me, because if it had been my own fault, this wouldn't have happened. I said, I'm sorry. And she said, you know what? This isn't right. This isn't right. I said, well what is wrong with you? Well here it is. You're the one who made her decision. Now what? This isn't right. I made hers. I want all of you to understand that. I want to understand that. And why is there something you cannot change? Because then you will continue to follow your husband and have children. You have children after marriage because if you didn't follow your husband's directions, and so there would be problems because it would get bad. But then you will feel like,
