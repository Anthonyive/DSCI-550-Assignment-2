Hello, Stop sending me requests for my account so early!.
As a businessman, I do not know many politicians and politicians who would put their name up for a government job that requires the money to help the families of victims of the NNDS. I am hoping that you will share the same understanding that I did, and that that we share will allow us to build on the trust we have built together to bring justice to thousands of people who lost their lives. We will build that trust on time and in the face of every adversity we face.
As the former president of the Federal Government, I will always be aware that there are political parties and political movements who are trying to make it look easy on the NNDS survivors as a group. Those who want to help us build a community in this country do so by calling themselves party members, which has become something of a dirty word on the left. If you are a party member in some other country, I highly doubt that you have been able to find a very good, well-educated, competent, and caring person willing to give the money and to bring the NNDS to justice.
Please, share your thoughts with me at http://www.w3.org/pl/hls/hls/s.htm.
