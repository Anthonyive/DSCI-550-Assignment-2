'In the event of a default on the fund, no other money shall be left in the bank's possession for repayment.' - Antonio Paizi
In July, the bank said it would repay $9.7 billion in interest, following a five-year lapse in the bank's balance sheet.
The government will be unable to pay back the $7 billion due to the default, with the bank and the government refusing to issue a single bond or exchange the money in euros, said the statement.
A senior official on Saturday described the bank's actions as an abuse of its reserves.
Speaking after the announcement, Colombo said in English that the government and the government must "take this into account, particularly the people who have lost their money due to the bank's failure to pay back it".
Brazil's finance ministry said on Saturday that it would support a plan to cut the debt by half, after the government's main target was implemented. The government plans to borrow as much as $16 billion from the fund.<|endoftext|>
