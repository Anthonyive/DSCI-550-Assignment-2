I will give you my real name and my mother's real name in order to get the name of my son (who is not yet 17). If the name on the name plate on the name plate is correct I may also allow your child to have his name used for the period of time required.

I will give you the following details for my family when moving out of Nigeria:

- the family name with the new birth mother's maiden name

- the name on the child's real name plate

- my wife's maiden name when moved into the home country

- if the surname is correct, the actual child's maiden name will be used for the period required
