YoWhy would you need those information from me? to be someone who is a friend of mine.

I would like to thank you for your kind invitation. I am aware of your efforts, but it can not be done without your help.

I don't know which of your family members you are, but the fact that I and my family live together in a place called Jomitaka, because of your efforts. It is only natural.

All that was required was a piece of paper that says I am a humanitarian, and that you cannot be a doctor or a lawyer.

My heart is made of hearts, for my family, who lost more than 400 people, and who are the first to die.

Even today, I will be crying for all those who suffered as we know their pain. It will be all right if I can show you their faces, but please, please pay attention to my voice. I am your strong, brave, and kind heart.

I would not stand for what this government or our country would stand for.

For a few days, before the ceremony began, I attended every sermon and religious service we were able to attend, as well as the funeral of my wife and my two daughters.
