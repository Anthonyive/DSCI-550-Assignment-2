To whom may concern, I need to verify your identity in a Programme that, like all U.N. Program Partners, is in the business of providing assistance to developing countries for the development of their economies of power and the development of their social and economic base.

While in my own country, I saw numerous times the problems with the United Nations Program. While the United Nations Program is in all aspects in the business of development, it is to give assistance to developing countries in the course of the development of their economies of power and their social and economic base. I would like to say a bit of clarification on the process and some of the issues which need to be addressed in this work:

--

--

--

1. No longer receiving direct support for development of economies of power in any capacity, with an increase in the amount of money being taken from developing countries as a result of the United Nations Program.

--

2. No longer receiving direct support for development of economies of power by sending to the United States an amount as low as 10%, 5% and 25% of the available contributions, as compared to 20% and 50% of the available contributions that have been made to the United States governments as a result of the United Nations Program.
