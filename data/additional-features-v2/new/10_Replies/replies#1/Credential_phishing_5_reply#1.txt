Dear, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! at the legal office of the President.
A second bank manager will be called to give a statement.
I will present at the legal office of the President his bank statement and the balance of the bank account (including the accounts of our legal representatives) when we will return to Moscow.
The financial system in Russia may go through some other changes.
For the Russian bank, the state bank of banks in the country may decide to be one of the largest shareholders.
The bank could not confirm the bank's position, but it will say it is well integrated with the Russian system.

I am not going to disclose the financial affairs of the bank and would not be able to do so.
The Russian anti-doping agency will carry out such investigations, and they should be transparent and accurate and they will not be under US controls.
All of these developments are so far outside the national interest that it will be in the interests of everyone to keep it a secret.
The decision of the Russia government to be transparent and accurate about financial transactions with the American public was confirmed in a series of court cases between two of its largest banks.
