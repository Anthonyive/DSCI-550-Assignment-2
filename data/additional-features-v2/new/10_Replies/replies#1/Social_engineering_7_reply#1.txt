In an email to reporters who attended his press conference on February 10 in the capital, Davao City, the former foreign minister, Miguel J. Calvi, said he had spoken to both Mr. Tagalog and the foreign minister of the Philippines, and that he wanted to speak with them about his arrest.

In the next two months, he has now told reporters that he intends to bring the international community, including the Philippines, together against a major terrorism threat.

During that meeting, he said that he had taken the decision not to release the names of the leaders of his two groups, who are members of the PNP, but merely as members of the two groups. He was informed that he would not be released until at least August 26.

At that time he would not release the names of the leaders, but only his political connections.

In March, the United Nations Security Council, the Organization of American States, and the United States State Department asked Mr. Tagalog to take into consideration the situation of his detained compatriots and that they be held at Guantanamo Bay.
