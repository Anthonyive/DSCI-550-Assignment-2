Hey,Thank you so much! adviser for a non-profit company that is based in the village of Njirard.
My business depends on a small percentage of donations from volunteers. The donors must make donations over 50% of the total. We use 10% for the new business. We take a few days to send a few donations to each of the beneficiaries.
We collect funds directly from the donors. As usual, donations are received through our PayPal support page.
Once a year, we send $3 to the beneficiaries with 100% of proceeds being used on the new business to pay for food, lodging, utilities. A few days later, it receives another $0 to buy food for our community.
As always, money from the donation goes to the same purpose as the donation of 100%.
As the beneficiaries are the "people of a big community", I expect that we will take care of the business in the long run. If they are unable to do so, then we will give them money for a new business that they can use. My hope is that it will succeed in making a profit.
Thank you,

Ms.Tajesh
All the donations will go to the Njirard village. The remaining funds will go directly to local schools which
