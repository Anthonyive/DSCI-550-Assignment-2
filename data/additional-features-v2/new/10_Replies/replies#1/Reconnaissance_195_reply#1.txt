Hi, I need to verify your identity rebel leaders of Syria to resolve the issue in the same manner as the United States would negotiate in the past.
The government of Syria has been a participant in the military campaign to bring the Islamic State to its knees. The group, which controls large parts of Syria and has been involved in fighting government forces in all parts of the Middle East, has been responsible for at least 14,500 lives and wounded more than 500.<|endoftext|>
