I also want to give you a pension for your time, and to cover the expenses which I claim to be required and which you can apply in court on and for you.
I am going to tell you what to do, as I will be a lawyer for your case.
I will pay the fees which I claim and I'll give you the benefits of your life, to avoid an ongoing bankruptcy.
I don't want you to be able to pay for a house with a view to getting a child.
So this is why I will not allow you to take care of a child.
I will not allow you to have any type of relationship with this child, and to marry with a father who is too little to care for your own children in a way that will cause harm to you and your children and to the government of Texas.
I will leave you to it.
So now I am going to write, let me know what you are thinking, you can choose either that or send me a fax, and I will ask you all your questions at once.
