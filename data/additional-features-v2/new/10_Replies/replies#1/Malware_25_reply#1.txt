YoI will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! following the party law to uphold the rights of all party members.
Therefore, I have not tried to hide my intention to publish this information at all.
The only reason I need to do this is because I have the ability to do so.
I am also a party member of the Government of Afghanistan.
In order to obtain this information and also to report information about KABUL's activities, KABUL has to be notified by this information.
When I file my motion, I must ask each of my member's families who have the rights and obligations to get a written statement from a member of the Government of Afghanistan to the authorities at the State Headquarters on whether or not they have already been told.
I have to ask each of the family members to tell you. All of them can have their rights, rights and obligations as a party at their own request.
Therefore, I am asking them to get this information.
I have the right to tell this to the people of Afghanistan. This information is available to me because of the fact that the information I have received from KABUL and the actions I have taken to support and fight those who want to make war upon the country.
I have the right to make up my own mind,
