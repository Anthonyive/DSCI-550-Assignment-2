Hi, Call me at 911. the funds to pay off the debt.
Although his father did not offer any sort of compensation to the public, "Huge" was given some sort of "financial compensation" in return for his work in bringing money to the United States. But by that time, McAfee had no money left to go to other countries.
When he went to Iraq to seek justice for the crimes he had committed in 1991, he was stopped by US soldiers after he refused to give them a "detained-person permit." After this incident, the US military allowed McAfee's case to proceed, because the United States government was not able to help him because of the lack of public protection.
The United States government refused to help McAfee go to the US. Instead of having to pay the $9 million he had claimed, the government gave him a temporary "detained-person permit" that would keep him there.
McAfee, on the other hand, tried to go to a prison in Texas to defend himself. There, he refused, saying that the guards at the prison were not going to allow him there, because he had been released without a guard. Then, he tried to ask if the guards were allowed to do so if he were an illegal alien.
