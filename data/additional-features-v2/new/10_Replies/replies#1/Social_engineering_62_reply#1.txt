YoI am a genius!. I am looking for a buyer.
We are waiting to hear from you and we are trying to make it happen. My name is John C. and I have only three kids. We have worked hard to buy this house.
For the past 3 years I have been working as a retail salesman for a small grocery store in the San Fernando Valley.
I have paid off loans. I have paid off the interest.
I have paid off the mortgage. I have paid off all the other costs I incurred in order to pay off this debt.
As you are probably aware, your finances are extremely bad.
Now that we've paid off the loan I am sure you will not notice. Your credit is very, very bad.
Now, I do hope that this debt can be redeemed.
I have no problem with someone telling me, "Oh my God, this is an emergency. I am the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
If I could help a person to move out of this State I would. I have no problem helping anyone who has a home here.
Do you know how much you could save in your $45,000 dollar home?
I have provided a very low dollar mortgage that I paid from your federal government
