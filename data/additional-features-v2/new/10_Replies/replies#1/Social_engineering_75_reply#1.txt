Hello, Your computer has been hacked.You must be able to access the email address you provided on the forms so that I can assist you.

You need to provide your full name to the court confirming that you are authorised to use the web for such purposes.

After you have provided your full name to the court, your name must also be placed in a suitable location on the form so that I can make sure that your rights are being utilised.

My only request is that you sign the form so that I can access your documents.

Thanks,

Mike Teicher

Dear Sir,

I am going to get to the beginning of making this kind of purchase by clicking "Download" into the 'Get to the Beginners' section so as to get into a link with the address.

I am not in a position to do this and I do not want to do it now, but my situation needs to change and I need you to have it here as we need you to have access to your papers to have your rights processed as well as in terms of being able to access any documents.

I have decided to go ahead with the purchase and the online purchases for the purpose of providing you with an online contact number.
