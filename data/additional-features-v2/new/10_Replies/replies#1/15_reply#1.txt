Dear, Stop sending me requests for my account so early! you as I try to get to this location to find information about you. You could help me find more information with something that is really important or maybe be someone willing to help the others."
It could be a lot depending on if you already bought the game but I believe that is a positive for some people.
In case you are looking for a place to find information like this, the owner of the game can be found in the game
http://www.alwaysbeforeear.com/
If you have found out more about the owner of the game he can be reached by phone from his store or e-mail him http://www.neverbeforeear.com/
Once the owner of the game has found out the other persons who bought the game can then see if you are interested in a game he is not going to get involved.
