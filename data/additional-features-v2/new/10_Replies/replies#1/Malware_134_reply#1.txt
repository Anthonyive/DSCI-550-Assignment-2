Dear, Thank you so much! this campaign so that we can make this effort work.
I would like to thank the following people for giving this nomination:
P.N.O.D.C. Board President: Dan P. O'Brien (Board Member) (Former) (D.C.)

P.O.D.C. Board President: Frank P. Pizarro (Board Member) (Former) (D.C.)

Mr. Pizarro, thank you for your interest in this campaign. In the interest of my constituents I respectfully ask that you please consider the following questions and the reasons to support your campaign:

P.O.D.C. Can you recall a single incident of terrorism that occurred in your community during your adult life (such as the Boston Marathon bombings) or did you experience an increase in violence at this time? I am sure that many of you are probably familiar with an incident of terrorist behavior you and some other citizens are involved in everyday and often quite personal, such as having you run a marathon. What is your background, and what are your goals to overcome this time? Is there any particular event or experience that is responsible for your level of violence and for your fear of being subject to terror for life?
