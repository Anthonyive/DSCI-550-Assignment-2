To whom may concern, My SNN is 123-456-7890. is a new friend and a 20 year old son. The son is on leave now.
The other reason I have changed my life is because of what my parents told me about my past. I have always loved my parents and when I met my future self, I did not want to move out of this country.
My parents didn't have many other options as I did not want to move to the United Kingdom. I am working to help my parents. I am doing my best to help my parents in any way I can.
I feel that the future is much brighter than I have had in my life so I am grateful that my father and mother in America helped me become a Canadian citizen and to this day the place I live in Canada remains my home. I am looking forward to moving to Canada after my current job.<|endoftext|>
