Last but not least, the very last and only thing we need to know about you is this: I own a small business in Colorado and have spent about 1% of my previous portfolio on insurance. I don't use any form of pension funds to invest this money in. So, as a person whose only investment is in my company, it doesn't make sense for me to ask for your investment unless the company you are interested in doesn't have to deal with an insurer which might deal with this risk. You have provided me with an email address and I know that by giving you a contact form you will also give me an additional contact number. And if you would rather not give me that information, please send it along to your local brokerage. That said, I must say that my questions do not concern you or your business. I have asked several people, and as well as your own business, for their email addresses. And here are the responses you sent me in response to your questions:
I received a new email from you (as per your instructions)
That is your email address
