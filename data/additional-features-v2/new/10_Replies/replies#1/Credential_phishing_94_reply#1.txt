My name is Baeliz Aja, it is a young man from Nigeria who was a part of the Nigerian military team which was leaving the country for Europe.
I am a member of the National Committee to Protect Civilians and the National Committee to Protect the Minerals (NMC) in Sierra Leone.
I was involved in the processing of the company's gold oil deposit in West Africa.
All I have to do is visit the NMC bank in London, and deposit my funds in the bank.
But since the ticking time of the bank's open date is now, I don't want to risk the existence of my money. I want to get my money through a bank account in London.
I want it to be safe from any foreign person financing it. I want it to be safe from any foreign person who may have taken my money and might want to invest it here in London.
The bank in London has already opened a bank account in my name and the bank will deposit my funds.
If I can get my money through the bank account, I will get my share of the fund to finance the loan for me and my family.
I hope that your time is ameliorated.<|endoftext|>
