The first person I heard of, and this was actually my wife, was when I heard about her coming to pick her up from her hospital in the hospital for one of those horrible events she went through. I mean, I have no idea how she's doing, but I was like, "Oh my God, I'm so afraid my entire world is in this horrible place, but there's nothing that's going to help her now." So she had no choice. She didn't know where she was, where she'd been, and she didn't know anything about any of this. And then she brought me the letter she'd given me that day, and she told me that the two of us have a very happy reunion right now; we met every day, we talk at a lot of events, she's in a lot of great waysâ€”
