Hi, You are the lier!to the fund's shareholders by July 30, when the fund expects to receive roughly $1.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its first dividend will be paid to its shareholders at midnight on July 5. The company has said the move will encourage foreign companies in oil- and gas exploration into U.S. shale deposits to try to develop and export unconventional oil and gas.

The merger, which will be overseen by EIA Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra, comes after the two largest oil and gas companies, Devon Energy Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Total SA Holdings Plc., all of which own 50 percent stakes in the EIA, said in a joint statement.

"Both companies are committed to our shared goals of developing the most competitive energy resources in the Middle East and Africa," said Tim Osterman, head of operations at Devon, a group that helps to organize the nation's energy exploration programs and that represents over 200 companies.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is the first to own 20 percent of the EIA, and Total SA Holdings Plc. holds about 50 percent. Chevron Corp., Chevron Corp., Shell Corp. and Shell Exploration Plc. have collectively held about 2 percent of the shares so far.
