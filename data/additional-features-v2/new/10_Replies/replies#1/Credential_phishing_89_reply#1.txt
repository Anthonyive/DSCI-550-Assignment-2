YoI will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! the western part of the country. The only difference is that my country only has the central bank in the country and the central bank is located in the city. I am interested in having the money for my country because of this. I am interested in receiving as many shares as possible and in the share if I am able to.
The reason I am not here yet is because I want to pay the debt due to my Nigerian wife, my Nigerian cousin, her family, and to help her to establish a home here and in the city of Kano (the capital of the country).
I hope to be there soon in some part of our lifetime.
I want to know the reason for not giving my Nigerian brother a share, because if I would have had the right to give him one, the debt he owes the country of Nigeria will be deducted from my share and he will have a problem with his inheritance.
I want to know that, after our decision, we do not give our partners even shares that are held by them in a foreign country or trust funds as per their rights.
