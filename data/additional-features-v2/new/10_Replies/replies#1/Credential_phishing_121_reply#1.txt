To whom may concern, I can not access to my bank account so I would have to go to the bank to retrieve my information. be able to afford it.

A month later, I have been waiting outside the gate of the banks office for over 10 days to get all this money.

As a 21 year old student in Konya, I was informed by my local representative that my contract is over, that I have to leave my country and shall be 'asleep in a bed' for over 10 days.

I contacted my lawyer, and he immediately got me into the custody of his local bank and my money has been transferred to this bank.

The bank cannot pay my bills because the money is kept in the bank in my name.

This is a serious matter because my name is not on the contract for the contract payment that we are going to

pay to you.

My lawyer has informed me that his client will be going to the next of kin to claim the money for his share.

The bank can not pay because I am a foreigner and I am the beneficiary.

However, I am still a university major and I am going to use my year of university for my career investment. This is not possible because the contract is to be executed by

my lawyer who is not up to date on the contract payment.
