Hey,Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. to assist me in this matter.
You may not reply to this question on your account or even know about your service. In your letter on June 30th, 2015, I said that I don't know whether you are serious about my answer to the questionnaire.
As to whether your reply is credible, I should say that I was not at liberty to respond to the survey and I have no reason to believe that it is.
I may not have the time to provide you with much information about your activities or responsibilities. Perhaps I will just ask you to write me in writing or to send me a detailed reply.
Because I never sent you any of this email, I cannot comment further on these matters since there is only time left until this matter can be addressed.
Thank you for your time and interest in serving and I look forward to informing you when I can.<|endoftext|>
