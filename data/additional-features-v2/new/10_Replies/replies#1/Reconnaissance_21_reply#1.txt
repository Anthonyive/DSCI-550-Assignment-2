YoYou have been located Vice-Chairperson of the National Security Council, and the Joint Security Adviser of the United States-Republic of South Kigali.

I have made a number of decisions, particularly in relation to the United States, my own personal interests, the foreign relations of the Republic of South Kigali and to have the same goal in mind when I think about my responsibilities.

For a moment I have stated:

I want to apologize for the lack of clarity in the preceding paragraph.

The following statement, which I do not intend to quote, was made in response to an anonymous letter by a member of the "Secure Government" group, on behalf of me. I took it up in response to your correspondence and have made this comment in response to the letter:

I regret to inform you of a series of matters which have arisen out of the personal correspondence and/or the private exchanges I have with the members of the United States Government regarding security and security cooperation between the Republic of South Kigali and the United States as of mid-September 2012.

I was informed by the individuals who made the request for information and the individuals themselves that they are aware of those matters, and that there has been no resolution about them.
