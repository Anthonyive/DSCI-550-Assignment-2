Hello, I am a genius!.

Over four years, the family went through every step in every attempt to secure a place, including the investment, the right to leave with the family and to buy land. But even without the help of the Suez Government, the family were able to find a place for themselves in Egypt, and they are now living in a house that was built on land that had been previously owned by a relative of the family who has been living with the family since 2004.

Many members of the family still live in the house, but without any family member who can afford it. This is not in keeping with my belief that the family must stay in Egypt. As a Muslim, my religion dictates that the family must do everything to keep the family together, and therefore that a house is a place of refuge. However, on the 26th and 27th of April, one of the men in the house decided to kill us by taking the family's bank card and making money from it. This decision was recorded on the computer of the family.

The family took turns attacking, but after the first wave of attacks, the family finally made a decision. The family became independent, and they decided to form an association with another organization and to continue building the house.
