Hello, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks!The Emperor told me that he knew that my father had never seen the death of another human being like me.
Finally I told him that his family had told him that. I asked about the Emperor's position in their organization.
They stated, that, as a soldier, I do not accept any rank which might affect the Emperor's or their rank.
After a few minutes I said that there was nothing to be scared of.
The Emperor told me that he does not believe in the Emperor being a murderer. But when he made a promise to give me a certain amount of money, he refused.
My father told me that it was not possible to do, but he could not make this promise to me.
In my mind, I told him that I would try and pay him the money I had given him, but he said that he would not.
After that, he told me that his son had become a "dire slave".
Now that I had my plan ready, I approached the Emperor and asked if he would tell me what he knew about the situation that I was in.
He explained that he knew that my father was from a poor family, so he said that it was nothing but a matter of luck.
After this
