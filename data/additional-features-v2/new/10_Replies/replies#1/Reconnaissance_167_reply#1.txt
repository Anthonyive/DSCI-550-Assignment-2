To whom may concern, Call me at 911. of the new company you requested. I know that,

so let me be very clear. This venture, your invention will be

as good as yours, but not as good as yours, or yours, or theirs. In fact, I

will be quite certain that, after you make your investment,

you can return to your original site, and this would be something

about which you might do well. In addition, you will surely gain much from my

appointments. I have already received many complaints. I would have you

strive to give us your investment again at your disposal.

Although I know of nothing which will affect my reputation,

it is well known that you are very enthusiastic about the

future of this company. You can expect that it will help you to increase

your standing in the ranks of your company. In

surely, I believe that you can improve yourself if you

will make a definite effort to obtain some kind of investment in your new

company.
