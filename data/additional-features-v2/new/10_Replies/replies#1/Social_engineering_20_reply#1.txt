YoI will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! know that I have taken the money from my mother and the government.

I have been taking money from the state as well as the state of South Africa.

I am hoping that you would not want to know everything that was done to my father in those last months.

If you can, contact me and I will discuss it in detail with you.

If possible, my trust and gratitude is to be extended as much as possible.

My purpose is to fulfill my wish, my dreams, my own needs and my husband's, to live in South Africa.

My husband has become estranged from his wife and his life. He has only been living with his father and the government. He is also involved in family affairs.

I cannot wait to see what it is like to have a real husband and to live in South Africa.

I am willing to lend your support and help.<|endoftext|>
