Hi, F**k you! know you think this is a great idea.
I've worked with you on different jobs, and you've been a great asset for me.
But right now, you've had a lot of work at your hands.
Today I want to talk a little bit about your life and career path.
I'm trying to find an opportunity in America that will help you make a real difference.
I want to start my career in America that will help me make a real difference and help me reach my full potential.
Your experience and qualifications will make you the greatest entrepreneur in the world.

I didn't plan to spend all that time at work.
