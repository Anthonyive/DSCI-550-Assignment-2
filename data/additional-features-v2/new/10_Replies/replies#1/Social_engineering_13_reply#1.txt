Hello, I don't have my own computer, could you buy me one? have started out by investing in my wife's life.
I have not put any money into her life, but that is why I am happy to offer your services.
Forgive me a little bit here for the long way around there.
You may be thinking: why pay me $14,000 for two years, when I could invest in my wife's life, while I spent some $2.2 million in my career and my life, and you are not giving me $7.4 million, and you are only giving me $10 million as payment for my wife's life and your entire life, or what you say, my life. But there is some information.
And then one day I will give you an offer of $10,000 which will bring you the best possible outcome.
I have already invested in your business in a limited way.
Now, I am going to give you a price.
What is your value proposition to be able to give you?
The best for me are:
The life.
The life is worth more than what you are willing to pay for it.
With that said, my money is better off in the long run.
I can offer you a service I will need to provide
