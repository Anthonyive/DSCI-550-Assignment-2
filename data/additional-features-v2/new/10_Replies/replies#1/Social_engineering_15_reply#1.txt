Hi, I need to verify your identity you and the other owners who own games. Your letter will be sent to you with the code I have in the game. A note will be also sent in my notebook about every item you will be using. I am going to have my hands full working on it. If I cannot find you, I will send you my information or inform the board at their office that you might be out for some time. I want to help you but I am so far away from home. It is all in my head to make it this far."

I will be looking forward to hear from you as I go through this business.
