To whom may concern, Your computer has been hacked. States government had committed to providing free and fair education to everyone in the U.S. that were not white.
This is a major problem. The government wants this type of curriculum. It seeks to take away our right to be free from slavery, and to provide an education that is accessible to everyone.
I am a supporter of free speech. I want free expression to be available to everybody, everywhere. I want people to be able to choose where to look, how they eat, how they walk, how they talk, they see that they can create new information, and I want people to be able to interact with ideas that they haven't already explored.
In addition, I know from experience that freedom of expression can be extremely powerful if it is not free. I also know that when a state does something wrong, people can use public resources to stop the police.
Sincerely,
Andrew-Paul Meehan
