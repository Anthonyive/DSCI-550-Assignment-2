Dear, F**k you! on the schedule of the game.
And also to give you all the news you have to know.
So it is going to be pretty intense, especially from here on out.
All the interviews, interviews, interviews and more will be held.
It is going to be a huge event for the game.
The first Spanish-Americans will be playing in the national and international game.
There will be more news, interviews, interviews.
I have told you about all the information about Spain and what the games will be playing in Spain, for starters.
There is a big new game being played at the international level, with the Spanish team playing the Spanish national and international teams (NIS) in a second World Cup qualifier (which will start on July 18th, 2013).
We will be doing all that.
If you are one of the 1,000 people here who have visited Spain to watch the World Cup Qualifiers, this is going to be a great opportunity for you to try out all the things in life.
This is going to be a great opportunity. I mean, it is incredible to be on your own in this country.
I will be in the air when I have to deliver all the interviews that we have planned
