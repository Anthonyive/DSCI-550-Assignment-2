Hey,Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. learning how we can cooperate with each other on the ground of our country and the international role of our country in the affairs of our countries and in the interests of humanity.
I have not yet contacted Dr. Davis directly to ask any further questions and hope to hear back as soon as possible.
This document was prepared in December of this year by my colleague, Dr. Nicolas H. Dey, who is still in charge of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. I sent it to Dr. Davis in exchange for my friendship and assistance and his free time to write this document.
I would like to say that in our time I have come to appreciate the fact that we are different countries which tend to have differing opinions and ways of thinking. I cannot speak for any single person. I do not have the power to tell you who is the right person for the job as one would have hoped and what a different person you would be.
Therefore I cannot tell you with any precision but please do give me my full name and email address and let me know what I need to learn.
I am with the Free University of South Africa, in Africa, as of January 26.
Dr. Dey
