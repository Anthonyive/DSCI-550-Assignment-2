I do not have a lawyer or a lawyer's representation, but I will assist you with this project.
I am very happy to help.
Thank you for your interest in getting this done, my name is David, I am a consultant and a freelance writer from Toronto, Canada. I have spent the last few years getting this done, in 2014 I came across the website of Canadian-Jewish Association. We have been discussing this to the point we are now at the point where it can be done.
I am glad to see you happy with this initiative, especially as it has made me an acquaintance with a local rabbi and a new friend.
