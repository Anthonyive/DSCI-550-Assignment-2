To whom may concern, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! able to attend my school in my country.
I want this student to be able to transfer from this country to any school in the Philippines as long as he is enrolled in college in my country.
This student will be able to pay for the fee that he costs for the examination.
In addition, the student will be able to receive the benefits of a scholarship that provides students with a chance at a lifetime of success in the Philippine National University.
This means that he will enjoy an opportunity to receive scholarships for his graduation and will earn a decent living.
I want to tell my story to young students so that they see the world more clearly.
I hope you enjoy your future in your family's school.
Thank you for reading my letter to the Embassy of the Republic of the Philippines in your letter.<|endoftext|>
