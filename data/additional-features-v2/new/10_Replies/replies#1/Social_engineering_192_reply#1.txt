To whom may concern, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks!.
This is a very serious situation for the oil companies that have been fighting the ISIL terrorist group for years, and they are not able to guarantee that the security of the oil fields will not be compromised after this latest attack.
A recent analysis by the State Department's Office of Science and Technology Policy and Research concluded, "In a conflict, the threat of attack from a single organization is not always a sufficient deterrent, and any effective mechanism is needed to counter it."
On July 18, the US Defense Department stated that, "We cannot assume that the potential for more violent attacks from Daesh (Islamic State) or other such groups over the next few weeks will deter or prevent them from making an active, significant threat to U.S. security and national security." 
However, in a recent report for the National Security Council in Washington, it stated, "While we can expect an increase in the number of attacks by Daesh in a short time (with time to strike), we cannot assume that it is sufficient to deter it from making a significant threat. Even if the threat of attack continues to grow, I cannot rule out the possibility that more attacks by Daesh and/or its affiliates will emerge as they prepare to commit a terrorist attack from the region."
