Hi, Why would you need those information from me? mother.

You will be able to know something about the process of obtaining this information through the news articles on the news news bulletin board that have been running on the news bulletin board in my mother's residence since her death from shock.

The information should be given to you by your brother in your house when you get your reply to your brother.

The information should tell you where the money has gone to for her when it comes to paying the bills of her mother.

Your uncle in your house paid the bills of her mother by the credit card.

Your sister in your house paid the bills of her mother by the credit card, so that the payments made to your sister was not lost and that the money may have been sent to your mother, or to her uncle in France to pay the bills of her mother when she died.

Your sister who was still alive paid the bills of her mother who is in the process of paying the bills of her mother.

Your sister who was living in your country when you got these information from my mother but didn't come back, so they spent their whole life waiting for your sister to receive the information.
