Dear, Stop sending message to this email address or I'll call the cops! $9 billion to end the 15-year-old dispute.
The deal would make the six-year-old dispute with the Chinese state run through China's own state-owned enterprises by 2024 (according to BIS official data).
As a result, a total of $400 billion would be committed annually to BIS.
The agreement would cost $3.5 trillion over five years â€” the same as when the government and the Chinese are set to sign the $1 trillion agreement that has been signed by China and Hong Kong.
The deal will save $400 billion over five years, according to the government, although a number of people familiar with the matter believe that it could not have been more than the current six-year contract.<|endoftext|>
