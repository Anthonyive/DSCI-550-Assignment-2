"The Government of India is trying to introduce the law that bans'self-hating' religions like Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, etc., which are promoting'rebellious behaviour' as illegal activities. The government must act now to stop such behaviour and to block 'disadvantages such as prejudice, stigma and discrimination'. Such an action, which will take effect during the new government period, cannot be taken lightly, we remind you to do as we do. We also remind you to consider the possible consequences of its action, what is the meaning of its action, how the new government will act, and to act accordingly. In our view, the government is the main enemy of 'faith'. " (Farsi: Anand Nagar, 2010, p. 51.)
