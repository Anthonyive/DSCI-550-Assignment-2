Hi, I don't have my own computer, could you buy me one? business partner in your company at your request, as I am very worried about your financial condition.

Now that I have received your interest payment in the month before this letter is due, the next steps are simple for our partner.

Firstly, we will contact the bank directly.

We will also lodge a formal communication from the bank with you as it is a bit different than other banks.

Secondly, we are going to make an application to apply for this transaction. This will also be done for your mutual investment in our company.

We hope that this will enable you to obtain and purchase mutual funding for your company.

We thank you very much for your support and we look forward to assisting you in this crucial step of the development process.

I am sorry to write this letter but I have just completed a thorough application for a personal loan from one of my employers.

I would like to explain this decision and we are currently talking about the details.
