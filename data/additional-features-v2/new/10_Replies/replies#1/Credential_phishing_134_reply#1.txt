Dear, I need to verify your identity our security in our country and to work on the development of a good relationship between the government and our businesses.
I have also started a small business to keep an eye out for foreign terrorists, the most recent of whom were apprehended by local police and sent to our country of origin.
The last part of the transaction was as follows, on February 14, 2002, at 1:40 p.m., my wife was arrested for domestic violence. Although I am happy to have the assistance of a competent person, it is my responsibility to keep my home safe at all times.
To have a good relationship, I have informed Mr. Paul that I will be making a certain call to my office that I feel will be of help to the government to deal with these threats.
We have also sent a call to Mr. Paul to seek him assistance to do the right thing, particularly with respect to our security. Mr. Paul is happy to hear that I believe that the situation is safe. Therefore, I will speak to the President in due course to try to assist him with the situation of domestic violence as well as make sure that the situation is well and fairly handled in our country.
The President wants to know that we can find you an answer to this matter.
