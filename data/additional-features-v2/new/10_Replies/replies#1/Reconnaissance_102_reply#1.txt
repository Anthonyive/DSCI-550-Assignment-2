Dear, I can't understand what you mean by that I have been working on for nearly 15 years. I would like to have an excellent business environment for a small company and for my husband as I have no financial need for additional financial support from me, so while I am the project manager, I still find my role very important.

In order to get me into this place, I will have to sell the "elite service" to a company, or, if there is a firm in the business, to a company that is already in bankruptcy, so I will be a "proprietary contractor". I will be very professional about my work and will have a very difficult time using it.

As a "job-creating" person, I am extremely grateful for the time and effort expended. I will learn a lot. I have worked hard with my partner. He has a very bright and talented voice and an appreciation for professional people. My business and my career are my greatest asset.

After much discussion, I have agreed that I will leave the project and give full employment to Myllena.

I am grateful that he offered me time and effort to make this project succeed but as the project's financial situation is complicated due to uncertainty of the situation and some uncertainty of the future of
