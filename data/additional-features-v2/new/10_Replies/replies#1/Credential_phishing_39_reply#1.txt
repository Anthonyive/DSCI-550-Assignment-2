Dear, Your computer has been hacked..

Once you have received the funds, you can continue to hold on to them until the law can be amended to ban the use of our money for personal gain.

However, with any good money, it is not so easy to be a good person!

On the 25th of March 2004, a British student, Sir Kenneth Rothwell, was murdered by a Chinese businessman with the assistance of a friend, who is an official of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Rothwell had joined the British branch of the Soviet state agency for the military service of the U.S. in 1940.

It was during this time that the British officer who gave the instructions to the Chinese businessman in order to assassinate him was assassinated in Hong Kong.

The U.S. Government, under the instructions of some of its senior officials in Hong Kong, started this attack by sending a message to the Hong Kong government on 11 March 2004 on the whereabouts of this man's corpse.

If you have any information to offer, please let me know, or get in touch with someone in your area, or maybe the U.S. Embassy in London on 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 March 2004.

Thank you.<|endoftext|>
