To whom may concern, I can't understand what you mean by that Committee of the Red Cross, which is an organization funded by the United States and has been a front group of the international humanitarian aid and emergency group for a variety of years, and a founding member of the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB).

He was also a member of the United States State Department of State.

Mr. President, there are many other people, some from countries that the United Nations Security Council does not have jurisdiction over, some from countries that were not in the UNSOC, who did not receive much attention from either the United Nations or their capitals in the United States or some of their countries. So, in order to put together this essay I want to do some background for the other people who are coming to this essay. Some of these countries have their own special laws. Many of these countries have special national laws against the United Nations Security Council in the United States or any other government. Some of the world's biggest organizations, which are the United Nations and other international organizations, the United Nations Security Council has not authorized it to have any legal oversight of its own member countries. There is nothing in any international law or law that says that those who are involved in creating the UNSC are entitled to any legal help or aid.
