Dear, Do you really think I would believe in this trash?inal piece of the puzzle, he is not the only person to see the potential for this to help the American people or to put the Republican Party in a strong position when it comes to its nominee for Secretary of State. I am not at liberty to write this and I do have to state it right. I do not agree with the views or stances of these people, but I must say that I support their nomination.
But my father does not have any interest in running for Secretary of State. I have to give him the benefit of the doubt and that is the basis of what I am going to have to explain. I know that he doesn't want to start a campaign with me because he thinks that he is going to get a free pass in this race. And now as I have said before, he has not endorsed that candidacy. He has endorsed the candidate for Secretary of State over a number of people with whom he has already had a business relationship. And I believe we now know what is in his heart, what is in his heart. The most important thing I think he will do in the campaign is continue to be consistent with his principles.
You can read a response from his father here.
I am a proud American, and I believe it is the right thing for
