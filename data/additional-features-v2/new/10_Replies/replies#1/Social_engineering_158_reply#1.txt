Hi, F**k you! Mr. LEO
REPRESENTATIVE REY, thank you very much.

MUNI, Mr. PRESIDENT.
As I mentioned in this article, Mr. Obama, if he were an outsider president, what would he say? Do you think he would not give this transaction his all? And, if so, will you believe that it will allow for him to deal with a situation that is already far more dangerous?
I can tell you something. I have been at the White House for so many years. It has always been my home, and I have always known what my priorities are. You know, I was in charge of foreign policy for six years in the Bush administration, but I had an appointment on this matter that my wife and I made to the National Security Council, the same time I took on this one. And the president of the United States, in that position, as I say now, knew this that we have been dealing with all these months because of what he had seen and understood. It would be far easier for him to deal with this crisis if he was an outsider. I had a lot of confidence in my colleagues from the very beginning of our administration. And we're not going anywhere
