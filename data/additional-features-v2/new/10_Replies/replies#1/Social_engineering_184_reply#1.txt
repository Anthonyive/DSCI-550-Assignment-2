Hello, Why would you need those information from me?company where the owner pays taxes on the money donated to the new business, or go further with a private company which has to pay no tax at all. This seems like a great idea, but I feel that it would create a financial crash for the company.
If your company were to have the ability to pay all taxes, then it would be completely unachievable. And if your company did not have any money saved up for these taxes, then you will have a complete liability as a lender. As I mentioned before, I do not think this would have been the case in my case. But I have been a firm believer that this is a possible solution.
If it were the case, then you would get a new business which could be owned by someone, and with you could bring your assets back to you, because you would not have to provide them with anything as a debt to anybody, whether it was your new company, a friend's bank, or a credit union. If you did not have a real way to fund yourself, then maybe you would just have to sell your own assets to do this. If you could do this, you would be free to use a few private partnerships. This was a way that I have not yet implemented.
