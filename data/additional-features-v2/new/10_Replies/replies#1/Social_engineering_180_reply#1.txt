YoWhy would you need those information from me?. I am not part of any political party, but I do support the working people of the country, and I am very proud of all the people who have given their support and supported me through this period. You can make a contribution to this cause by going to our website, here: http://www.cidi.co.uk.
I am quite concerned about the impact this would have on our children, especially because of the recent attacks on teachers, who are also on the radar of the police and the military. In some cases the people that were attacked may not even live in one of these areas, but I want these people to know that the British taxpayer is going to do anything to protect them. There are concerns about the impact this may have on their children, but I don't think this will ever happen.
My main concern is the impact it may have on the very vulnerable. I want people to know that our people will be very worried if the UK's future remains uncertain.
I will now go to London and tell you how I can help and protect our children.
My main concern will be that you will think about your family and that other children's lives will be affected. I will say that I am not aware of any child welfare
