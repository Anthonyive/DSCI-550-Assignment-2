YoYou are the lier! hands with the SBC. Thank you,
Robert.
I would hope and pray that you can stay with us as this deal does not come to fruition and the current business relationship will not be maintained. Thank you,
Robert.
You are now being charged with violating the terms of the Agreement, and the parties have both notified the court, and the court must be aware that you are a "nonresident citizen of the United States with an intention to emigrate" (emphasis added). We will continue to fight for your civil rights.
