YoWhy would you need those information from me? and you are not here because you don't want to listen to the Russian President.
I am Yusuf Samutsev, a member of parliament for Ukraine, and you are not here because you are too scared to talk to Russia's President.
As long as you do not stop following Russia's political agenda, I hope that our two countries will remain together.
Please take my message as a sign of my commitment to my country. If a Russian citizen tries to assassinate you, I say, "Why do you not want this Russian President? Do you want to talk to him? Why did you not stop following him?"
Yusuf Samutsev, member of parliament for Ukraine
Yes. That's what we are going to do. We are going to send an official letter of our intention to the U.S. government to get an indictment of me, in an official letter. We are going to give our legal opinion so that you could tell me. We also plan to visit the country of our citizenship in Ukraine, and see what sort of information is available.
It will help you in the investigation and in getting a better understanding of where that information came from.
We will also bring you a letter from the State Security Bureau
