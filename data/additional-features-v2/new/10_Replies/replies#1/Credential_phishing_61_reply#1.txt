It's been two years since this deal was negotiated by our banker who worked in the

international banking sector. In order to make sure that no one was getting their

deposit cheque when our partner's payment is received, we set up a cashless

payment system

called the Bancario

To ensure our customers receive a secure and efficient

payment, Bancario uses digital escrow technology which helps to secure and secure

payment of cash, or other electronic payment services.


The Bancario uses the cashless method to keep our customers' digital

accounts secure and secure, using a combination of the following:

- Access your bank's data

- A'secure' system which protects your account from theft

- A separate, public database of your personal finances

- A password-protected and easy to access bank account

- A secure smart card

- And a smart card
