To whom may concern, My SNN is 123-456-7890. will work hard for my family, friends and for my future. I don't know what I will get with this life because I will have no sense of what to do with myself. I love to do it. I want to live it.
The only thing I can say to other people is that my life is not my own, I am not able to control the thoughts and feelings. I want to keep myself clean, free of any personal worries, and also stay safe. I want to be an independent person so that I will be able to do what I want.
It is my hope that my wife, my mother, my mother-in-law, and all my relatives, will help me.
When we find out what happened to my family after my marriage, I will tell them.
We are going to have the children together and we are going to have free and honest marriage and health care.
Every time I see a girl cry and be angry, I say, "you're still young, are you?" "Where are you going, boy?" "You're just going to say what you want and tell me." I tell the girl, "just tell me about what happened to you, and you're going to live with me forever
