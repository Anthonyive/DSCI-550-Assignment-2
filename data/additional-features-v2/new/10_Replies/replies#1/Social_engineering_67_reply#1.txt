Hello, You want my bank account, I'm having trouble turning the computer on. Can you help me? December 2003. The son of lord of the people is still alive.
We need to give it to you. You know that it is the best thing that you can do, we have only two brothers with us so we can have our own sons to keep. We have told you this:
He who wants to go ahead will be able to do so by the second day after the death of his brother
Then, we will sell them that he wishes, just by giving the money out to him (the king) so that we will not want any more problems in our kingdom
But all will have to be made into the coins to pay for the family expenses.
This money belongs to our brother (the son of lord of the people).
But he is not going to go ahead at all. He will not be able to give any more money, and we will lose him.
He is not going to do anything out of the kindness of your mother.
It would be good if he kept those debts. He would not have any problems.
What is he going to do? He has no need to keep his debts.
The kingdom is yours. This is his duty and duty to the people.
This is the law, this is the
