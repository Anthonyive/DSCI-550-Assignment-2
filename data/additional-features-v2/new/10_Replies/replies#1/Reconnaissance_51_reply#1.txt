Dear Mr. M. Gaud,
I have read some reports on your website saying that your business is profitable while at the same time having no financial stake in the United States of America. However, I have no further information about whether or not your company is profitable or not. My questions are, how can you trust your business partners, their families or the financial success of your company.
One way or another, I have been working on my business for the last 5 years or so, and it is very hard to invest any money with any one person because of the financial pressures of moving to the United States. I have told people about my business on social media and even some people have given my information to you. Most of you will never understand why I want to work with you to help me. This is also something I have been working on for almost 6 years.
I asked a family friend of mine that has given financial information to me to share. She gave me a large amount and gave me $100 which I used to buy a car from her
