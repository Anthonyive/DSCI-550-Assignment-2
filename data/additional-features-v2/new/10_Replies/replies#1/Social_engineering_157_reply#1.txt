I have also added a little bit more information to give you a better understanding. I am going to begin to use this information to get more and more information about the Foundation.

I am also going to use it to further understand why many of you are very, very upset about this news of the Foundation being broken apart because of it.

Please remember, I am going to make this information even easier. Thank you so much for supporting me so that it can improve the website of The FOUNDATION and for giving me your information.

Thank you in advance.
