Hello, You wanted my SSN, here is my birthday, where are you located? we don't have any money and are going to take him for an interview with the authorities, or when an attempt is made to take the family home. We may need to ask our brother or sister to put a bounty on their head.

We hope to meet with the authorities in an effort to be able to help them get back their lives.

Please pay your respects to your loved ones, because the world is too small to be able to save everyone in the world.

We are going to follow through with our wishes, and we will find this money quickly enough.
