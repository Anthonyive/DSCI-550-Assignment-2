Hello, You wanted my SSN, here is my birthday, where are you located? this money for domestic development, while supporting the African National Congress (ANC) "to work together towards a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunity."
There were protests in several cities, including some in the capital Zulu-Natal, which were led by pro-Mugabe protestors.
Many, including one leader in the NPP who is also a president of the ANC, objected to Mr. Mugabe taking public funds, believing it would only be used to improve the lives of poor people.
The resolution demanded that all funds made available to the ANC be reserved for economic development projects, which are already being done in Africa and many in South Africa.
A large number of African civil society groups, including the Association of African American Journalists (AAFJ), have been working closely with local and state government agencies on issues related to the African National Congress (ANC) and other parties in African and Southeast Asia.
In the summer, local ANC supporters took to the streets to demand that Mr. Mugabe immediately stop his countrymen from going on public bailouts or face serious charges.
The law also said that any funds paid to local and state governments in the past could be used to support various programmes or other non-agricultural purposes.
