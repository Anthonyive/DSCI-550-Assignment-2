Hi, Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. first to share this matter with you. I have met my clients and worked with them, as well as with my wife, but the people of this country have no business speaking to me. I understand that a formal relationship between your company and the United States government is not in place, and that there is a possibility that it could arise.
If it did come to that, I would be very grateful if I could communicate this information and explain my situation in a simple and polite manner so that I can have it sent directly to you.
The Department of State and the Secretary of State have sent my information to you in the case of a business dispute with a subsidiary of your company. If it has been resolved through a dialogue, my company may have the power to appeal this action by sending this information to the person acting on my behalf, and I encourage you to consult with an independent arbitrator. I ask that this matter be reported immediately to the Commission of Inquiry, and then you can go to my website to receive this information. Thank you.
I will report back in the next few days and provide you with a list of the following items you need in order to avoid this process taking place:
1. an account in a bank, such as Credit Suisse
