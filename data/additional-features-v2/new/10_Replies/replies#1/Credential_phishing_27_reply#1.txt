Hey,This is too hard for me. money will be transferred to your accounts soon.

If this money goes somewhere else, you will have to give me advice about where it goes and how to proceed.

Please give me that information.

Don't hold me hostage and it's not easy knowing.

My wife will be spending her time on the telephone with other people, so I am not able to make any commitments.

It's going to take me a long time to come out of the closet.

I want to help you, it's very difficult.

What's the best way to help with this money transfer and what you need to know.

Please tell me more in the near future.

If you have any questions or worries, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Your best regards.
