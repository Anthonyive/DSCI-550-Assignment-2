Hello, I've located your ip address. and you may have to pay up to that amount.

As I will not give a return on your money, I have been unable to locate any financial means, so I think it should be kept strictly to my own advantage.

I have no other choice than to pay you my money as soon as possible.

Thank you,

Dear Sir/Madam

How did you deal with the money?

It has been a long time. I had a few transactions with the money, but at the moment I have not received any return.

Therefore I am contacting you as a foreign who is to become your partner at a later date, to be able to pay my money immediately.

Therefore, I have decided to contact you first as well, since I believe you will not accept payment in person, as there is no way to find out who is using the money.

Thank you.

Thank you.

I have already signed the agreement with you, and I would like to be given your information on the account information you need to locate the funds.

Please, have you signed the
