To solve this problem we need a design strategy that is compatible with our business. This is really important as it allows us to make sure that we're making any changes that you'd like to make on your app. A designer might think "that works and it is fine".
So what you should really know about a designer in the first place is that when designing a mobile app, you are not trying to make any significant changes, just to ensure that your design is not too different from our own.

The "view" should reflect the information that is provided by the screen on the mobile.
The "layout" should reflect the details that the app provides.
