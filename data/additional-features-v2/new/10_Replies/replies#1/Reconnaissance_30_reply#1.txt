Hey,Your computer has been hacked. illness may have a long-lasting effect on your life. We need you, to help us.

I am sorry I said this. I am sorry I do not know when I will be able to answer questions of your interest. I apologize to my father and to my son.

I am a father of five who has been diagnosed with chronic cancer and I have been fighting for years to see him, because I fear that I might die of cancer if I did not keep him. I'm a cancer survivor, which means that my daughter and I suffer an emotional breakdown and a physical breakdown that can do untold harm. As a father and father of two children, I am sick of being around people who tell me that I'm going to die of cancer, but I am also sick of being around people who tell me that they are going to put my life on hold and that this man is going to die in two years for me and my family.

Since my father died I have had the opportunity to spend many hours with you and to talk with you about this man's illness. I wanted to explain that, as my son and I grow older, our relationship will change drastically. This is due to your medical treatment and my father's health. As
