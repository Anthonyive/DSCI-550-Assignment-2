Hey,I don't have my own computer, could you buy me one? South Africa where the

manufacturers in the process of building this one had found out about this

product.
Then he asked me to help him fix the building.
This was a new facility where the production of cotton and

the cotton was being distributed.
But that new facility was all being developed by a

foreign company.
In other words, he was giving the money that they were doing an overseas

service service to their client countries, so his client countries

were going to pay him what the company paid in North Korea.
He said he was going to fix this building.
And here's a picture of the building.
I told him that I would like to get his permission so he could

take it on his own.
I asked why. He said he is in his early 50s and has not seen much

of a future.
At that time, I have been teaching a lot in South Africa. When I was

running there, they were selling us up to 40 million dollars for the company,

so at that time, I just had to take advantage of it to get through to the

world.
After that I got an offer from them in Europe
