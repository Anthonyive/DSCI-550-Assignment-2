Hey,I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! will not allow this plan to become a political war of choice for the U.S. government.
The American government has yet to respond to the Russian actions and it's now clear the Obama administration is no longer willing to take their part in making this possible.
The U.S. government officials, as well as the United Nations and the Russian Federation (and thus both sides in a legal war), are now using the success of the meeting to advance their efforts to make a political situation in Ukraine impossible again for them to continue. This is what the administration is trying to do now, which is to delay the start of the new U.S. Presidential election.
The official explanation for the U.S. military intervention in Crimea is not clear. This is because the U.S. does not have a diplomatic role in Ukraine.<|endoftext|>
