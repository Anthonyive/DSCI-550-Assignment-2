Mr Guan Shing said that he agreed to invest the money in a company that will provide security for the clients.

Mr Guan Shing added: 'This may be the first case of a real estate tycoon having invested a large sum in a firm of his choosing.

'It's important that we follow our commitments to make sure that we ensure that our investments are not damaging the bottom line of any investor and that we have the funds to cover the costs when we get there.

'This is an important case of a foreign company that we believe will provide security to our clients so that they know that they are being protected by us.

'In the future we are sure to follow our international rules and apply strict procedures when dealing with investments of this type.

'That is why I am looking forward to investing this money in a firm that will provide security for our clients so that they know that they are being protected by us.'

Mr Guan Shing said that when he was first getting the investment, it was to fund his property and property and that was over ten years ago.
