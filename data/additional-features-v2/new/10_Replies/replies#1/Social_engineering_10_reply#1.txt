Hi, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! business.

This would be very difficult. How would I do it? Would my family ever have to take the risk of moving or live in our country? Would they also risk the money being held in fear of losing their home?

If I could take you to my home in rural Illinois, we could relocate our family to that state. We would have a safe and comfortable home and we would never have to struggle with this security breach.

The company would have it covered if it had just moved out of my county to North Carolina where the kids could live independently and no one would have to worry about getting a good mortgage. The company also would be compensated fairly, but for the cost of living would be greatly reduced.

Even after all this time I have never had a chance to think of an alternative to this nightmare.

How would I move my family to a place where my family is safe and well-regarded?

As you can imagine this is an incredible prospect. You are already thinking about how you might make it happen. I am very hopeful and ready to do everything in my power to help you find that perfect place.

As it is, I am asking you to help me.
