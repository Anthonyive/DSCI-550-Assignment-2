Dear, How can I get the money? give up your legal and administrative rights or your right to legal representation and I know that many of you do not have any in common. I am very sorry for the pain and loss that this has caused you and for that I would like to thank you both for making an impact for the United Nations and for all of their dedicated efforts. I must apologize to the people in this country who did not feel that I could handle what I did and also to those people who had the audacity to try and steal my assets, money, and money from me as a journalist.
The funds should be placed in the Swiss money store where I am legally obligated to have one of my assets and money.
If one of the funds is transferred to an international bank account such as the United States Bank in Switzerland I am sorry you will need to move these funds to another bank account in the United States. In my opinion, this action in my knowledge will not harm my financial integrity. I also apologize if this can be a cause for more trouble.
I am in charge of investigating the financial crimes of the governments and foreign governments associated with that country that are alleged to be related to the banking system and of the International Banking System, which have allowed these crimes to proceed. I'm hopeful
