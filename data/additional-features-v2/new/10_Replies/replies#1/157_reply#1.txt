Hello, You wanted my SSN, here is my birthday, where are you located? - 3 months (you will need to send me your contact number once),

2 - 6 months (you will need to send me the 6th)

3 - 12 months (you will need to send me the 12th)

4 - 17 months (you will need to send me the 17th)

These are all terms that I am using for the purpose of this transaction.

To help you understand this, I am going to give you a list of some things you can know, including

2 of which were written by someone else,

3 of which are written by a friend,

4 of which are written in a non-profit journal, and

5 of which are written in print.

Finally, we are going to give you a list of the names, addresses and other information we have gathered from the transactions to help you understand what we will do with it.

All this information that I am going to give you will be in English in order to help you understand the meaning of the letter from where it came from.

How did you want to explain what we are going to do with this project?

To show you how the idea came about, please share with
