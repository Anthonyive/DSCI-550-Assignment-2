Mr. Bill Goss, have you lost your phone? I cannot make any comment at this time but we have seen the photos, the picture and the text messages. Please give us time to contact you and I will try to contact you in a few days.

Dr. Peter Hore,
Thank you and I hope you will understand my question very quickly. I would like you to know that I am now a father and I am also a husband. All this has been achieved in this very difficult situation. Since we have taken care of Mr. Goss it was easy for me to forget that he had lost the phone.
