Hello, You want my bank account, Iâ€™m having trouble turning the computer on. Can you help me?. My husband came to see me but we were at the same hotel room. He is also in need of assistance with food and other needs. I believe his money will go into a trust that is in the United States and will eventually be able to transfer it to our children. I'm just making this decision. I have other options. I can do whatever I need to keep the family in good health, well being, and hope that our children's days are not as difficult as they would like. I'll give the money to someone who is prepared to do more to help and will be able to repay my bill.
We need help because I believe my money is in the hands of other women with better needs. You are getting help out here. I believe your money has also gone to help families like your, and many women's, and men's who have lost family members or loved ones at home.
Thanks again for everything! As you would know, my family is poor. They have a limited income, but we live on $1,400 per month. They all have to earn some money to pay for school. We are the middle class families. We are the ones who can support our children with the help from their parents in these other circumstances because
