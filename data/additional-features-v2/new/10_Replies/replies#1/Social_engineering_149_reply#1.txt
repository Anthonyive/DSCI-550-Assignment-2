Dear, I need to verify your identity in the UK's first non-GMO game development firm, My Lord. You have already given me the first copy of the first draft of this game, the third one of the six, and my first order of business.
My Lord wrote the game design and art, and I am writing your letter to remind you all that I am the creator of this game. I look forward to working with you and your team together.
You may also email me at "me@mediamail.com" at the bottom of this page.
And as a personal note, as is the case with my past correspondence to you, I will be writing back to you as often as I feel time permits, as soon as the time is right. If it's your first time around, and there are plenty of people to be around who can support you on this game development journey with any generosity, please have a look at my post about my Game Maker Pro-Ed for my colleague.
Goodluck!
