Hi, Hey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. and credit cards.
I am not an expert on Nigeria. I do know for sure that foreign banks don't care about Nigeria or foreign customers. But, I am interested in knowing how the NEP was structured and how it is being used in Nigeria and where the government is funding NEP, the process of creating the contract for the NEP and the financial arrangements with NEP.
Is there a chance you could make a statement about how the NEP came about that you think can be useful to a trade union representative, as well as what we are about to hear from him?
The NEP's goal is the creation of a national energy system. The energy system is one of the things that is lacking, particularly for the African markets, where demand is really growing.
The NEP is a technical and economic mechanism for transferring natural resources. It has to create the conditions in which people move out of their homes, in order to use them.
I am not a representative for the United Nations. I am a member of the NEP committee and my interest as an observer is to know the process which is being followed. It is my opinion that the United Nations system was designed in such a way as to allow Nigerian people to access resources where they needed
