Hey,I can not access to my bank account so I would have to go to the bank to retrieve my information., please note that I do not have any experience in bank lending, but am not in a position to tell you about how much I have borrowed and how much I paid out.

The World Development Bank is a major financial institution in the Eurozone and most European countries, where I am the chairman.

In my role as the World Bank CEO, I worked with several regional heads of banks and the Ministry of Finance. It was my hope to serve the interest of the whole population, not just the depositors. In my years at Bank, I have served as the CEO in nearly every aspect of Bank's operation, from the planning of the bank's activities in some countries to the management of the Bank's operations.

As a member of the Board of directors of the Bank, I am responsible for coordinating operations with other international central banks across the European Union and the World Bank. I am also the Managing Director of the Council of the South-Eastern Banker Association, the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Poland, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).

The Board of Directors was started in 1991 by the Bank's World Development Bank chairman, Klaus Korcic
