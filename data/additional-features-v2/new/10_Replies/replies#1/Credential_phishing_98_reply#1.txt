Hello, I am not stupid.  asked to take over the money that is due for the delivery of bills that are due to be returned to the U.S. Treasury.
To date, the U.S. Treasury has not been able to provide any reason for the over-invoicing of the U.S. Treasury bills that was taken over from the IMF.
The IMF says that this over-invoicing issue has been addressed in a resolution from the Ministry of Finance in which it asked the U.S. Government in 2013 to withdraw the Federal Reserve Bank of New South Wales (FDR) due to over-invoicing of the bill that is due to be released from the central bank of Nigeria.
There are six different bills that are due to be released from the United States Treasury after being released from the Federal Reserve Bank of New South Wales.
In this year's Budget, the Treasury released a total of $22.5 billion. The Treasury has had a hand in over $4 billion in over-invoicing of the U.S. Treasury bills.
There was an international settlement of the over-invoicing issue between the United States government and Nigeria in 2008 when the government of Nigeria agreed to waive all of the over-invoicing concerns
