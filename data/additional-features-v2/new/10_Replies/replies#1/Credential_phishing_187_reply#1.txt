Hey,OMG I'm so lucky! the finance of Kuwait's banks; and I am determined to succeed in fulfilling this responsibility.
Dr.Nassim's appointment as Chairman of the CBOK coincides with my having agreed to the appointment of Dr.Nassim in charge of the Bank of Nigeria.
Dr.Nassim has been on the Board of Directors of some large and well run Gulf banks.
In June, 2015 I made the following public statements (in which I did not mention the Kuwait bank):
"My name is Dr. Nassim Abu-Nassim, but I am not the president of the Bank of Kuwait."
At the time of my passing, I did not consider myself a member of the Security Council. I was elected by the members of the Committee on the Bank of Kuwait (CBOK) and had taken the position of Chairman of the Security Council.
I had always considered myself well liked by the members of the committee, which gave my name to the Security Council as well as to the Kuwait Bank and I never thought that there would be any issues with having my name and image associated with the bank.
The Kuwait Bank, which was formed in 1983 after the creation of the Bank of Kuwait, now has 11 shareholders.
