YoHey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. Nelson

In your letter to the Secretary of State, Mr. Nelson referred to President Carter, the former president of the United States, as his "father" and said he is a hero of American patriots and "great leader of the nation."

He said: "I am a hero, not a villain. I am a patriot and I will remain a patriot."

The first of many instances of Mr. Carter's bravery and loyalty, the second was shown when he came to me as a young man and offered to help us restore the Republic. That is the first time that Mr. Carter has been given the opportunity by his former government, to help us restore the Republic.

Mr. Carter's willingness to help us are admirable, and I respect their dedication and commitment to the cause of justice and the pursuit of its ends.

However, I will also not allow the political influence on my administration of your current government to influence how and when I answer your letters.

As soon as my letter to the Secretary of State was received, I went to the Office of the President in Washington to report on your letters of support in the State Department.

As you know, I received this response to my letter, not on purpose
