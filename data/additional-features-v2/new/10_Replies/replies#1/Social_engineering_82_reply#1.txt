Dear, My SNN is 123-456-7890. my intention and the need. I have decided to let him know that I am so eager to go on a path of taking care of the son, and we will use this to help bring this child into a place of fulfillment. We are talking about it on this point, and as you might know, the next one is an interview with my first husband's family. We both want to see him grow and thrive as a human being and to be able to have him grow in ways that bring him peace, happiness and fulfillment.
We will give every dollar I have.
Please do be as ready as possible as it is possible.
