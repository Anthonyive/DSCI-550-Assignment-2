Hi, Why would you need those information from me?. I am a retired Army Sergeant from Los Angeles City, California. I am working full time from 9:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. on the Sunday after the last game of the day to bring you a copy of my old and original game. I was recently working at the same table as you on another occasion when I would usually get an hour or two off in between games.

I am not aware that you are able to make more money this week as you are trying to get back in touch to let me know what I should have done with the money, but if I may help you and allow you some time to collect your check and do some research I would be interested to know your personal needs.

Your help in giving me any of the funds necessary to bring you the game and some of the materials to purchase these books is very appreciated.

My son, Robert Louis Louis Jr., was the first son of Robert Louis Louis Jr., who died in 1995.

The book was written by Michael O. Brown III, a former Police Officer.

As you will see in my book "The Price of Admission and the Price of Death" I also have a copy of my copy of John Trav
