The $20 trillion notes will be the first in a series of 10-year-old notes that will be published under the Federal Reserve's monetary policy website.

Bank of America Corp. said in a statement that it will continue to hold $20 trillion in new notes, which can be stored in an account at the Fed.

The Fed will use those notes at other banks as well, including the Bank of New York Mellon and Bank of Tokyo.

On Wednesday, Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledged the role that the Fed plays in the financial system in the wake of a series of bad news.

"It's been obvious that the U.S. economy is in trouble," Bernanke said. "We need to focus on fixing that, not fending off another big crisis and another recession."

"The Fed has been involved in more than 60 rounds of quantitative easing (QE) since 2009. And this is only the beginning, I think," he said.

In its press release announcing the release, the Fed will not raise interest rates on next year's funds because the money is to flow into future account holders
