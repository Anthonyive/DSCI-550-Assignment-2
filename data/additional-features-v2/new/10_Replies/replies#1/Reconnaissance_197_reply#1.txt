To whom may concern, Why would you need those information from me?000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
In fact, I am your very servant, your wife, and for that matter, your sister. For you have given me the right to visit a man who has been martyred. When you visited him, you killed him in front of me, you took away his blood, your shoes, your clothes, his head, all the jewelry and all his weapons and armor, and then you dragged him from the church. The bishop who was at the time, Bishop Dostoevich, has been sent to the place of martyred and you have not spared him.
Now, there are three men in me, all of whom, in the name of God, will have their heads cut off. The other three men I do not wish to speak with in this matter, but must be taken as accomplices. I am not at fault for killing them. When the whole of the world saw me going to the church and seeing the murderer, they are going to pay for the torture of that man. They will be called the sons of the devil.
