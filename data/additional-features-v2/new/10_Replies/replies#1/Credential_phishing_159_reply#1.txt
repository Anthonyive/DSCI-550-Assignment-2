Hello, I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks! British occupation of Palestine. The British government attacked his country in a foreign country.
My father was a revolutionary who was against the British occupation of Palestine. The British government attacked his country in a foreign country.
My mother was a revolutionary who was against the British occupation of Palestine. The British government attacked his country in a foreign country.
My father died in Syria; my mother died in Damascus. My brother fled the Syrian army and I have also left our country, I was on my way back to Damascus.
We are trying to reach him because he did not want to come back to the States; he wanted to come to the States and this is what he wanted.
My mother gave my brother a wife and she took him to her home and he was a good man until his wife came back from Syria. She returned to his home to tell his brother about me and he never spoke to her. That is what I told him when he came back to Syria; that was my family and he never spoke to her.
And all we can do is tell his family to do the same. I wish he would have stayed for two weeks, and maybe one month.
