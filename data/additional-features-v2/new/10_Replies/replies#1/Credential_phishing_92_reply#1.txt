YoHey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. was extremely poor and neglected when I married him. We married to a foreigner in a hotel and he had a serious illness. I had hoped that the money would go back to his wife and children. Sadly, he had died and we were unable to pay the money back for eight years.

Now I am working with you to come to the conclusion that this money is being transferred to the account of the merchant in my foreign bank. Please ensure that we get the money back.

If you can agree on that date or to arrange a date to move the money, I am ready to work with you. I think the money is safe and the merchant can move it as he will have it back for the reason of God.

With great pleasure and good luck in your journey,

Mr. David Geble.
