Hi, You have been located email that looks similar to this. I don't want you to become the target of a fake scam (since this is a scam) unless you provide a full picture of your address and any other information you want to post. If this makes you a target please send me a message saying you would like to share this information on the site. This may happen within the normal email, I am not happy to be sent such messages to you. The business of a scammer in general will continue to go through a system where a person may take a number of different approaches. If one approaches the scammer more than once, his method will be more elaborate, which will give you the most confidence. The business of a scammer in general will continue to be the same. If another scammer approaches the person more than once, their approach will be less elaborate, which will give you the most confidence. If you have ever heard of someone getting a hold of a laptop or smartphone and would like to make a call with him, just give him the number, and send him an email. I am not here to make this kind of calls (just do what I ask), but I will ask anyone who has dealt with this situation to be patient and answer every other question that you may
