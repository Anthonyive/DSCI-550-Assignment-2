Hi, Stop sending me requests for my account so early! personally visited you and my agents.

The funds are in my name. I have received $200,000.00 USD from you, as an indirect benefit and I have also received an amount of a fraction of the funds that you provided me.

My legal fees will be based on your personal financial situation. This is because the US money can be lost and there is no money available for your security that I am required to share to cover this loss.

I need your assistance as I am seeking compensation for this damage caused to me or for the costs associated with this damage.

I am asking for my protection as I am in this situation and have contacted you in advance, to arrange your departure from Mexico.

I want to ask you that you do not act in a way that will damage your financial situation. In any case, I have asked you to contact my attorneys and I can provide you with your legal representative who will be assisting you.

In your letter I wish you and the entire USAM family a happy and happy 2014!<|endoftext|>
