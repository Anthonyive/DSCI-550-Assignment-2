My office's Attorney, Ewa Muth, has appointed as Director of the Law Office of the FPC, Dr. Alba Shamsi, as an assistant prosecution officer. We are seeking Mr Shamsi's permission to use his legal knowledge in our investigation to resolve all legal issues of importance to the FPC.
I request you to carry out all necessary measures, as determined by my office, and to establish who should be the principal defendant. I am informed that Dr. Shamsi has been accused of trying to manipulate the financial affairs of the Nigerian financial regulator, with the aim to change the way Nigerian banks operate and to change the way in which they provide their banks with capital. I have previously requested him to sign a document saying that he has an obligation to disclose his name and to apply to obtain this information on all Nigerian clients, but he failed to sign it.
As an added punishment, the police and prosecutors must investigate the crime if they are investigating any fraud or tax evasion.
It will be necessary, then, for me to inform you that Dr. Shamsi may be the principal defendant in
