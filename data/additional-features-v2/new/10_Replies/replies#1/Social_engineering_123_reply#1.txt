To whom may concern, You have been located fail to do that then I have the ability to refund those expenses you have given me.

If you take money and fail to repay them, I will not be able to provide assistance.

As soon as possible you are not in the country for the fee of $15,000,000.00 ($15,000,000.00.00) and will be taken to the International Airport in Dubai to collect your business in the UAE for you, as a foreigner, if I am given such information.

If I will provide you with such information, it will go to my bank account, and you will need to pay the rest of it to me. It will then go to the IRD account under my name, provided that I have provided it correctly.

I will send you the money and give it to the money transfer service.

You can also contact me via email (email me at mr.t.coffman@gmail.com) and ask for a copy of my account number.

Thank you very much for your time,

Tom
