The official death certificate shows that Major Brokaw was shot by the IRA on October 11, 1971, and died on October 13, 1972, his body thrown into the water on the beach of a fishing boat off the northern side of the island, near the beach where Major Brokaw had made his escape.

The official record shows that at the time of the shooting, Major Brokaw worked at the local police station, but did not go to the authorities in time to investigate the murder in question.

The official death certificate does not disclose the address or telephone number of the police station where Major Brokaw lived at the time.

The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) was established in 1982 to investigate the murder of Major Brokaw.
