Hey,I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks!
2. I welcome your message. I understand that you have not met in person with me. It is a great shame that your privacy would be in doubt. However, I will be able to provide you with more information, for the record of my involvement in the transfer of money between Nigeria and South America, to the person who will take the transfer between Nigeria and the South America. If this information is necessary, then please ensure that I will be happy to answer to you.
I hope this information will be of benefit to you and may make you feel more welcome in the future.
I ask that you continue to keep this information to yourself and your colleagues.
Please note: We do not have a business relationship with your personal data.
We will give you further details regarding this relationship shortly. Thanks.
Best,
M.C.

Dear Miss S.
I also want to thank the person who I met in my bank account. He took care of the account and I contacted him
