YoYou are the lier! University of California at Berkeley, where I was in charge until I was informed that we had identified my cancer and decided to take no more action because of the risk. I have a large family to take care of. I am in the position to do a lot more to help those in need. Thank you for having me to do this. Now, I just ask for the kindest of treatment that I can. My cancer remains untreatable and I'm working hard to get the life of an ideal human being put on hold so I don't have the chance to develop any more cancer. As an insurance carrier, I understand that you will be a huge help. Now that I have met you, I am starting to be concerned I may lose my job if I try to gain your attention. I am very sorry that I have to be at this very difficult time. However, I am grateful that you have provided me with this opportunity, especially with my current condition, so that I do not have to make the arduous wait for the right doctors to get rid of my cancer. I am hoping that I will be able to offer you an opportunity to speak with a representative of an alternative path for people with cancer in my industry, to get an understanding and maybe to hear
