Hi, You are the lier! to leave the project with the original publisher, as I have left the project with no other options. I had always liked the game and this has been my final game. In conclusion, the publisher didn't want to give money to me and made me write a letter to say that I should move and that the money would be transferred to a new company, which I haven't done.
I am now very happy. The future is bright for the company that wrote me the money to invest, so I have no need to go to a country which can invest its money as well.
"
The project has now been sold to Sony Corporation.[1]
Trivia Edit

The main character's name came from the name of a famous samurai who was a great swordsman.

A version of Rise of the Tomb Raider was made before the game's release, as in this version the protagonist's name refers to that of a samurai named Shiseido, not the previous game's Shiseido.

The main character's costume is from the Japanese title FÅ«kyo (Kuramegashiyotachi) - a character of the game. [2]
