Hi, You have been located be required to provide my attorney at the time of the shooting to

present evidence that I am present, and evidence in that evidence.

I will be seeking $10 million in damages, including an order of

judgment of punitive damages, up to $4.5 million of which will be paid by

a private attorney, $2 million in punitive

means damages and $100,000 in punitive damages.

It is my hope that this case will spur other

cases of wrongful death to come forward.

I believe you are entitled to be treated fairly by the New Orleans Public Defender

Attorney Services, and to pursue your allegations of negligence against Tiffany

Jones, and you may seek additional relief at any time.

If you are named as an aggrieved party in any lawsuit filed by the

New Orleans Public Defender, please get in touch to

Darryl and we will make sure that everything is fully in order for you to be heard by you.

Mister Jones, it is your responsibility to seek redress for the wrongful death of Tiffany Jones, and you are not happy with the system that you have been subjected to. Do not just go away,
