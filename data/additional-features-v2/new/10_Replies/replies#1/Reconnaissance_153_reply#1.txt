Dear, I don't know.  by our United States allies.
As it stands today, a strong and democratic government is critical to ensuring the safety of our people and to the security of our democracy. It is at this moment that it must be the responsibility of the United States Government to provide that country with the necessary security and assistance if it is to maintain democracy and security in the world. In short, our United States is a global power, and we should not be burdened with the task of trying to create a democracy in the United States.<|endoftext|>
