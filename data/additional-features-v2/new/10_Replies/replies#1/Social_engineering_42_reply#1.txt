Hey,I can't understand what you mean by that the O.R.E.R.A.

Thank you.

I'm afraid the police of the Philippines would not understand your request to help.

What I have been told by the police, with the assistance of the I.R.E.R.A. has been that there is a case on O.R.E.R.A. when the owner of the company is being investigated, but this is not true.

In any case, there is no proof that the O.R.E.R.A. is being investigated, but this is not to be ignored.

The O.R.E.R.A. is being run by members of the Philippine National Police (PNP).

For any information concerning the O.R.E.R.A. (Independent Security Services) investigations into the O.R.E.R.A., please contact the Director of the Philippine National Police (PNP) directly.

My name is Mr. Victor Hinojosa and I am the son of Victor Hinojosa and Michael Hinojosa, both of whom died in May of heart attack. My family and I met these two people once in 1991
