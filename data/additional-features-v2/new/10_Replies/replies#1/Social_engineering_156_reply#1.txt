To whom may concern, Thank you so much! the public officials I will send them and inform them that they will need to consult a solicitor before transferring their funds to a local bank or government or account of this country for their final release," he said.

The letter also urged the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and EU member states to provide legal assistance to Turkey by April 11.

Turkey will also get a "clean slate" of lawmakers after the next parliament election.<|endoftext|>
