YoI don't know. yodor Yagoda.
According to the documents seized in the Italian court, Yagoda "received over one million euros from the European Union to pay for services such as the diplomatic conferences and humanitarian aid in the Republic of Cyprus," but only after his arrest for not giving his name in writing.
According to these documents, Yagoda "received approximately twenty-five million euros from Europe for services in Cyprus as a member of a group called the Council of Europe, the Council of American States, and the Council of Foreign Relations and Economic Cooperation."
On the other hand, I am not sure that Yagoda paid back his payment to the U.S., so much that there are no records of payment of any kind. I would assume that he did not know about this payment of money, in which I was involved, and did not know that he actually received more money than he said. In any case, what he received was "money for books for humanitarian aid," because I guess the payment was only given to a select group of donors.
I can also say that he had a "payment of $25,000 for two books" and that his payment of those two books was merely a "payment of $40,000."
