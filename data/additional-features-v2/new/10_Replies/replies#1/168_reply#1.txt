To whom may concern, You wanted my SSN, here is my birthday, where are you located? also given the money to the only surviving son and daughter
of the President
Nuremburgu, Nuremburgu's second wife, and her family. My family
(that includes my older son, daughter and granddaughter) were the only other 
surviving children of the late President.
I gave this money in a legal deed in my country in 1994, the first 
year to be the year the money came into my hand, a note to the 
foreign dignitary.
I also have decided to give away the money to the only surviving son and daughter of the
