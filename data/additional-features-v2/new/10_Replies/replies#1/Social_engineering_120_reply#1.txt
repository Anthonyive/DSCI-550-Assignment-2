Email address of the company contract.I have already seen some emails from the company representatives that suggest you may need their help if your email address gets misused. It might be that you used the wrong address or they are actually talking about your business. Your business address should not be used as an alias. If you receive an email from an organisation that doesn't have the address in your email, please get in touch with one of the relevant authorities and contact the relevant authorities as directed.We hope that with a combination of the above it will be possible to use your business email address and address to address your customers so that they don't need to send you emails again.Thank you.
