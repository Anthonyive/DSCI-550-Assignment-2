Hey,I will go to Western Union to write you the check tomorrow. Could you provide me with the receiver information? Thanks!
Since the end of the war in 1991, the Nigerian government has been running a bank account in this country with a huge amount of money.
It is because of a number of misdeeds by the Nigerian government that we have suffered through some of our most important civil wars in the past years.
I want someone to run this account and can claim the money as a foreign fund to which I will be entitled in this country.
I will also be required to turn over the account to the Federal Government of Nigeria for processing and deposit into account.
I have a limited amount of dollars, which I intend to use in my account to pay off debt owed to the government.
I want to be able to claim the money as a foreign fund to which I will be entitled in this country.
I am also looking for someone who has been involved in the payment of the FIFO bill to the Federal Government of Nigeria for the purpose of running a country bank account.
