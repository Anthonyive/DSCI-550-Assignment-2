To whom may concern, Stop sending me requests for my account so early! get this down right. I am really proud that you decided to share this with me. I know that I have to tell my family and others I know who I don't have anything to hide, but I am still a little scared to leave what has become my life. I hope that you all read this and keep it in mind. I also hope that this blog helps people, in a way, know that I'm doing things the right way. If you are one of those people who wants me to share my story, and have a life that is not serious, and would love to have one, you can do it at least once or twice a year. You can do it online or on my Tumblr at www.blogger1.com. You can also do it on my YouTube channel at www.youtube.com/blogger1.com. If you don't like it or want to stay anonymous, I will be happy to accept your money on Patreon to help me keep going. I appreciate all your support.
