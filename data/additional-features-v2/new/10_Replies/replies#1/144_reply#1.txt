To whom may concern, Stop sending me requests for my account so early! clients. I know that for people at that level I will be unable to do that.

Mills, who is suing Schneiderman in federal court in Los Angeles, was not aware that he had a client that had a better agreement with the tax treatment agency.


She was an advisor for AIG for some time and she contacted the attorney general. While the attorney general was not privy to the specifics of the lawsuit, she said she is sure the settlement he obtained from Schneiderman had nothing to do with what is being done with the company.


"This lawsuit was initiated by the individual who sent this email," said Gina Mills. "She was not authorized to share information with us or in any way obtain personal information about him and would not have provided that to any other law enforcement authorities or court or agency until after the outcome of this action is reached or the outcome of any litigation by us."


Mills said that Schneiderman made it clear to her that he could not file a motion to enjoin her from submitting any documents about her work.
