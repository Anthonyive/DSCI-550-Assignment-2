To whom may concern, You wanted my SSN, here is my birthday, where are you located? a job and the opportunity to do something different.

I know this person can't believe they have a job. There is no job, and they are doing it because they love money.

I have no problem with this either. I want you to invest in one of my games. Your entire life, you will not be happy with the game you have. You will not play it, because of money, but because you love it and you want the money to be used to play your games. This is a bad idea.

I think this is my responsibility as an indie game developer, and I understand that many people will disagree. They have their personal opinions. They have their own personal views on these projects.

I'm not saying that I'm against gaming. I'm not against games. I want you to know that this game can be created. This is one of the coolest games I've made in my life. This is one of the very few games that can truly be considered as one of the best games of the year.

No matter what you decide, you must love playing this game, and I have no choice. I want you to play, and enjoy the game. This is what I want you to do.
