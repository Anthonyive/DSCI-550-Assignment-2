There is no excuse for anyone not to learn about your business, and no time to try and find out.
That said, this may include those who do not have access to a local power and/or local telephone number, if they have a lot of time to do so, and who have access to a great deal of information which you can use with confidence.
All this information is confidential in the interest of public disclosure, but I assure you that I have an obligation to provide the highest levels of information to the people who need it, and I make sure that no one can abuse the data in any way, shape or form.
While I may not claim to speak for every person who has expressed interest in my business, I firmly believe that a few of you will have to think harder about how they can possibly benefit from the information that you provide.
I believe that the information to be provided by you in this manner is confidential and your business will not be affected by any of the disclosures contained in this information, including the information regarding any of the information that would arise based on the information provided in this situation.
