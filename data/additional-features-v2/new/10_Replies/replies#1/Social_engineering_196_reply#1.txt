Hey,This is too hard for me.The attack came a few hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was briefed by a senior official of the Home Ministry to identify a gang of men, known as Sipat Srinivas, that had taken the two young boys to their homes, ransacked his apartment in Madhya Pradesh and abducted their mother.
The family received no response, but was held under section 313 (murder and theft), and was later questioned under section 294 (stalking). The four accused, aged between 12 and 14 years, were arrested by the police a short time after the attack.
The government has so far refused to give any details of the men who murdered the two girls, even though it had a warrant for their arrest for murder.
The victims' mother was later arrested by police. She had allegedly confessed to her husband and the other two accused.<|endoftext|>
