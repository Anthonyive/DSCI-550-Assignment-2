To take over this operation, Foreign Investment Board (FIA) are now required to sign a declaration of financial assets and also a statement of investment value.

The official declaration of financial assets (FDIC) is used as the basis for approval by the U.N. Development Program Development Plan (DDP). This is the document to allow foreign investors to build on top of Dutch investment, while creating a successful partnership with foreign investment partners.

A second financial assets declaration of investment value (FIA) was also issued which said, in part:

"A partnership between the Dutch Government and foreign investment partners in the United Nations Development Program, shall also be declared and will, in all respects, be accepted."

This step does not involve the Foreign Investment Board nor does it mean the foreign investors, directly or indirectly, who may have investment in the country are responsible for investing there.

However, all the money received for the development of the infrastructure to which foreign investors would be entitled should be provided for by the Dutch Government.

This has been done in order to ensure that the private sector does not use the funds that are not available for investment through the EPR. This includes for a large number of projects.
