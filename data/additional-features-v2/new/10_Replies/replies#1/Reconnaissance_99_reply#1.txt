To whom may concern, Thank you so much! for over a year. I was not aware that I was in any kind of trouble, so the military authorities immediately put my children out of school. My husband and I immediately agreed and after we were released, they started the search for me. We are in Hawaii with our mother on a honeymoon. The men, myself and our daughters go home to them with their families. I hope that it will be good for them to live with their mom and you, too. I think that in future life will take care of you well and you will always have some responsibility for me and I hope that you will be able to meet me as soon as possible. Your future children will be able to be with you.
"I, as the president of the United States and the representative of your family, will continue to have my respect and my own security so that my son and daughter have the best opportunity for life. I do not want any problems that will harm or interfere with the family life, particularly if I'm unable to do that for any other reason than health reasons. I have had no previous issues of any kind and they all have been resolved at my request and I hope that I can help you as well. I cannot control you at this moment so please help me
