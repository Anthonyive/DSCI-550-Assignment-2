YoHey,yes! I can definitely provide you my information. Do you wanna meet up somewhere? Maybe we can grab a cup of coffee and talk more about the details later. got people that want to help me make the game. They are the same people who have helped me get the idea to send you this game out of my own bank account. But they can not give me the money.
I have only one thing to say to you: Go to the game store right now and get the money!
