To whom may concern, I need to verify your identity you are the only person who can deliver the money.
The bank may be unable to move the funds from your account to any new account and so you must send the funds on to an appropriate person within 30 days to cover the cost of the transfer.
The funds will be moved from our mutual fund after an initial period of close consultation and a further period of six months if funds are transferred. This means that they will not be affected by our failure to secure any assets from their new accounts.<|endoftext|>
