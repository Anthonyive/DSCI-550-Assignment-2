Hey,Stop sending message to this email address or I'll call the cops! that does not live here. It does not come from these people. My father died in an accident just five months ago, my mother was in a car accident last year, and my father died just six months ago in the same car crash the day after. I went to visit my grandmother one time, she was there when I met my father, after the crash she came back with us and said, "My grandmother did not die last year. I'm here with my aunt, my aunt said I died."
So, my mom and dad went to visit her, I have a brother who is in a car accident, I saw his grandfather, my father went to visit my grandmother and my grandmother came back with me. Our family is very sick. Our family has four orphans, one has six children and my mother, we have eight little boys and one girl. My grandfather lived all his life. The government is not doing anything to help me because my family is poor. This is what happens when all these people who had great intentions to support me, go to the very poor, take care of them, just to support the poor, but what they cannot do is give me a good home for my family, they don't get to give me a nice life here
