YoYou are the lier! in the next 20 years.

I'm in Russia, and it was only because I have the best opportunity that I am willing to do this for Russia.

Thank you so much.

My only regret is that we don't know, and do not know who, if any, these people are.

Also please contact us directly. This will be good for everyone who is affected by the news.

For example the internet is a big target for the terrorists and the money is not being used to support terrorism. We also are not in contact with those responsible for this and I don't want you to think about your funds at all as you're doing yourself a great service by sending your money over the internet and sending your money over your phone.

Thank you very much, and remember to give them time to get to you.

Signed,


Alexander Gevlin<|endoftext|>
