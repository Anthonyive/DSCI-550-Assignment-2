Hi, How can I get the money? and my life is very
tired.
I am in debt to my account and have done very badly.
I decided to move to France a few months ago for 3 months,
to pay off some unpaid debt to the account.
At first I was extremely nervous, especially I was
expelled from the military and I have suffered from anxiety for about 2 months.
I am still recovering but this is very
difficult. I have been able to obtain free medical care.
I have done everything to get my account
understanding and will definitely be providing you with more information about
your money as soon as possible. I have not given this
service to any of your bank and will be keeping this
service to myself as soon as possible.
Thank you for your
submission. I am also sending a personal
receipt as my
follow-up.
I hope you are able to respond as soon as
please.
Sincerely,

Diamo

Your bank is responsible for all things to do with my
account and can make any necessary
removing fee from it.
