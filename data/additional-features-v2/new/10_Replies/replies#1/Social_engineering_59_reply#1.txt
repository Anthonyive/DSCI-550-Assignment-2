Hi, Your computer has been hacked. getting some of this money for this investment and hope you will help me as much as you could. I will be checking this company monthly to see what happens and also to see if they can offer some services I don't have to cover.
Thank you for your interest. I may not be a complete financial person, but I am not a stranger to scams and I've only ever known someone who went into business doing something I never expected to do.
I will put more than $20,000 to help get my own business.
Best Regards, Leo V.
