Hi, OMG I'm so lucky! let you know that I will have the last word as to the project of my son, and that I will be given the power to make any necessary and necessary changes to it, which I will not take.
For the next week, I will call you at 7:30 am, that will take place on Tuesday, and the plan must be finalized and executed for my son to the shareholders, which will not be any more than we have been promised.
You can also make a request for the transfer of your funds, which will be in the form of the following:
-I am interested in building a business called S.F.,
-I had hoped to invest the funds.
The company is to come off the ground.
I need some money for the property which will allow me to do my first and second purchase. You can make the request on the website at www.sfinvestins.com
Thank you for your interest in our company.
Mr. Simeon and his family
