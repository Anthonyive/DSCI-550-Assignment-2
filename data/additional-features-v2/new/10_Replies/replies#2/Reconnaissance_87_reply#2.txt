To whom may concern, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. Since then I have become addicted to opium and cocaine, consuming it as an illicit trade with the Colombian government. We have been in contact ever since. The government has been trying to help me, but I was afraid they would not stop us, but instead I was trapped by this heroin-eating drug. We were unable to leave our home but found a road and called my family here. We know that my father had to turn back, but this is what we know! We love you, Your father. He can never go to prison. He still leaves his kids here. Your father has come down with typhoid. I've been staying with you. We've got to do something to get his blood out of you. And he is dying! Please, Don't kill him!
