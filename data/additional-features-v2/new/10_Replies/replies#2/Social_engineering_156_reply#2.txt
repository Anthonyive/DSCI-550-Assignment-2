Hi, My name is Andrew, and I am a programmer for Google. The reason I'm here is to keep my work out of the public domain. I would like to thank Google for helping me get the project into the hands of the community and making a more informed community.

This blog has some big changes with it, which I'm working on on the horizon. As a result of being removed in August of 2012, we are running more work in Alpha and this is now nearing its end. However, before we can begin work on any major feature changes, we must address the issues that you all have expressed.

Please make sure your address is correct. This will allow our team to know what to do with this message and get back on track.
