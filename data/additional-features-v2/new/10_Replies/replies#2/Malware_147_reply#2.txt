Dear, You have an unpaid debt. unpaid debt. Would it not be nice to be paid what you owe.

Have you ever heard about a good guy who has been charged with a petty crime and has been placed on probation, but when his wife asks him, "How do you repay your debts?" and then gets slapped, "Well you're out of luck because you got kicked out and now your husband is making his income out of this. Let's make a movie for this debt. You're paying now. You're good at getting along."

But you wouldn't let that happen on your head unless you were a good man who had the courage and knowledge to learn the lessons of the previous guy's life.

So, I'm asking for a few of your contributions to help me pay off my debt to this great man. I understand you need this money for one reason only: to make sure your child is healthy, has an educated mother, and is able to raise your children in an environment with clean water.

You need the money because I am begging you. You must support me and I will. I beg because I don't want a problem this bad. I want to make this a better place to live. And I want the money for your education and for the education of your children.

You know that I'm not your friend anymore, so I need the money for you.

Wellâ€¦ I'm your best friend, and you love me for who I am. So please give your donation today. Don't waste my time and money doing so. And if you don't want to donate, then send money to me,
