Hello, Your grandfather has left you a heritage.He is a very interesting guy, so do know that in the late late 1990s, I did a deal with him. He agreed to let me do a deal for $20 million, which was pretty much all it took.
The only problem was, I would not be able to afford him that deal, because I am absolutely bankrupt. So he just sat me down and said, "We can't agree on how to do this. I will find out if we can find a solution." That's what the banking systems do, that's why we decided to try.
My reason is this. I am not a rich guy who wanted to do this deal. I wanted to make money, so I just found this guy and bought him a ticket. That is what that was about.
I did not want to give up that business, and I wanted to get out of my business, even though it was not as profitable as my real idea.
That's why I stopped going after the real deal, because I wanted to make money from this.
I really like Mr Howard, he was very smart and interesting, and I was very happy that he and his company had been successful, and I can see they were well positioned to make that deal, and
