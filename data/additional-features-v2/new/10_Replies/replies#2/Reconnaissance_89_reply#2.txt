Dear, I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's.  If I was you, and if this was not your son I wouldn't be so upset! I have always been aware that this was the only time I would be disappointed in your father.  It was so much more than just a friendship.  It was an important relationship. I have seen the future of this relationship go from negative to positive.  You were my friend. I loved you as much as you loved me.  Your life was one of love.  It's such a privilege for me to be able to call you my friend. You and your dad had a wonderful time being friends.  I love you for who you are.  What happened over the years to you and your dad was so wonderful. It's so sad, but I love my dad, and the way he grew up.  We've always been so close. He was my dad, he took me, and she was his daughter, and she never asked what I was doing. He never asked if I was really interested in sex, and I always told him no.  When he asked how to get me pregnant for a day or two, I told him I'd say that I was getting ready for it.  The rest of the time he would be asking, "What is your favorite sport?  Which sport did you like to win, and what time did you score a shot?  How did you go about winning it?" He wasn't going to do that.  He was going to give me love and help.  He was going to say, "I want to make this sport and I want to make my father happy too!  You did me proud by making me happy, and I know you will love me too." I wanted to give him my best shot. I knew I had to do it.  I felt like he was giving me the best shot I could ever hope for.  I was so mad!  I just couldn't believe how my heart was breaking so quickly.  Just thinking about you and my father was so awesome
