Dear, I am not a robot. This is a real person writing here. these things are true. And that they want to know what they feel. They want to be free. Or at least have the self worth and self conviction they want. Because things aren't going to turn around for them. They don't want to make a big deal about things that they believe are real. And they're scared. And they want to not be. And they want to be able to see these things. And they'll let you know.
And it doesn't matter what you say. So stop it. Stop it now. Stop it, stop now. Stop it. Stop it. You shouldn't do it.
Stop it for a while.
I'll get into the details later on in this post. I'll see you next time.
Happy Holidays, and happy christmas. ðŸ™‚
