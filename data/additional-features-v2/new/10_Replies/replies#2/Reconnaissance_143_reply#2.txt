Hello, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago. working on things that are going to enable me to live here with you, in your house in the United States.
I am here to bring you to a place where you may live, where you might live, where you may live in peace. You have a job, you have a home, you have a home, you have a job that pays. It is going to help me to live here.
In the coming days I will start my first day of working here.
The first day of working I will be with you.
I will start with you in a peaceful place where I do have the freedom to do what I want. That is my first day, that is my first day as a citizen. I don't see myself going to be a very happy person for the next few months. I want to have that freedom.
I am a person who wishes for this to be what I have been for the past 12 months. I want to work for what is right.
This is my first day in my new life here as a citizen. It is going to help me.
I am going to get a first look at my home, because what I wanted to do was go shopping, go to the store, go to the dentist's
