Dear, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago. few months, we have seen some good efforts from the BIS to bring this situation under control.
According to the SCO, which is a big player in the global financial markets and will do well under the new regulations, "there can be no compromise". And, we will not go back in the business with the SCO to stop this.
As for your concern that our business may not be profitable, we have made a number of efforts to organize the company's management team together. We are currently working to bring together members and people around the company to build bridges and a framework to ensure business success. We are working now to develop our business relationship with our management team and will keep that with our core group.
Thank you for your continued support as well as for all the donations that we received from our sponsors and support network.
I believe that in the future we would be able to put this matter under the control of the BIS and the SCO with the hope that such a situation could be avoided.
Thank you so much for your support.
As always we want to thank you as well for your continued patronage of our company.
The BIS has not been willing to do much to help me financially. So, I want to thank
