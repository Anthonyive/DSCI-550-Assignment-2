Hey,You have a package in Fedex, please call us back! all us back!  For now we're still a tiny bit confused as to whether or not I could help you out.
If you're like me, you don't know what "departure" is either, but you could definitely come up with some answers as to what type of departure you are.  I know it's still not all that clear, but it's certainly a very common sight to see people leave the country without informing their immigration officer.
Here's a simple one: most of the time they'll leave the country before they leave to avoid having to go back home again and, when I tell you about some of the "why do I need this visa" questions I usually end up with:If you had to go overseas, are you going to let an illegal immigrant go, or what are you going to do for me?  My recommendation would be to go to another country if you have a certain level of safety and if you're lucky I could offer you some sort of safe refuge.<|endoftext|>
