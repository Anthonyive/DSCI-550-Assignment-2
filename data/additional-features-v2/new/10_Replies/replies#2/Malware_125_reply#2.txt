Hello, This is Donald Trump, I am RICH. I can give you 100,000,000 dollars. 000 dollars.  I can send you 100,000,000,000 dollars.  And I will send all of those money to you.  This is what happens when you give 100,000,000,000 dollars.  I will send that money to the government of America, and I will make that money a little higher.  If you're rich, you know the power that the money has.  It can change the world.  Now you've got the money.  Now I just need you to sit down with me in your car, with the lights off and the engine running.  What are your thoughts on the latest Trump administration announcement that I can only assume is a continuation of one-sided efforts to force the federal government to provide more information about its people about their past and for whom they may have committed crimes? 
Trump is not a fan of what he says.  He called them a "fucking whore!" But, he claims, the government "can't hide that they're doing all kinds of stupid and ridiculous things that nobody likes."  He said that he believes in the rule of law, but he's never met one who didn't agree with him on this point.  Trump says he wants to "save the world," but he said the government needs to do a better job keeping "terrorists out of America."  He wants to prevent people from committing war crimes, but he says he'll "send our generals out of the country." He says the "fucking lies" used to justify war crimes must be punished by the government. He said the "so-called terrorists are the real terrorists," and claimed the "radical Islamists" should be punished.  He said that the US has been successful in detaining a lot of people who had "terrorist ties," and that he hopes the Obama administration will help make them "feel like a real family," and promised to protect the U.S. with
