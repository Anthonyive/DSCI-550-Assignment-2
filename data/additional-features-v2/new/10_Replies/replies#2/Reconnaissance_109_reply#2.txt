Dear, I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's.  I was just looking for a little help with your problem.
You're getting really lazy.  Just look at the number of times we've talked about how much more your son likes your brand than you think you do.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm just getting to the point now where I'll actually try to stop going out in public.  And I'll admit I wasn't even too pleased with that.  Well, not to show me how many times they're going to throw you down the stairs and put your shirt on.  They actually did it before when they saw that you're really doing it on purpose for your wedding.  And my name is Jack.  I used to help you out when I was younger, when I was a young kid.  I made sure to pick up a few extra steps while we were together by the door, or even just the way we worked.
Now I know for a fact that I don't want you to have an affair with any of our kids.  I don't want you to be any friend to your dad.  Because I mean I'm talking about your son, and I think I don't wanna hurt him very much.
If I told you I didn't want to be friends with anyone who got in a threesome with a hot woman, you might think I'd be the
