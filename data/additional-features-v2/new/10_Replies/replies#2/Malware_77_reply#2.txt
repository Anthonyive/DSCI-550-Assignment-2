Dear, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. I couldn't bear to see my former husband continue to fight the life he loves, which he left behind behind. I've known him since before I even knew him. He's been my good friend, my heart, my dog, my friend. He's a man, a loving dad with a great life and amazing love life. He's given me everything I've ever wanted and asked me to continue to provide for him.

I know we will not be able to return to him. I'll be keeping him from doing what he wants to me. I feel like he is my god and my husband and I have great respect for him. But he is hurting right now because he isn't accepting that I'm still his brother and his sister.

Thank you in advance and I'll leave all of this at home. I know it's hard on you, but please, don't let your brother-in-law become my brother and you are hurting him. I'm sure you would like to know how it can be done.

So, if you have any questions, call me at:

615-737-2725 or 965-531-9144. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. My family loves you and is supporting you throughout this difficult time, including my sister-in-law's mother and stepfather. I love you and look forward to taking care of you soon.


Thank you in advance as I have this family with me. Please, consider my prayers for you and their love and support in the coming days and weeks.

The Heart:

The Heart of God
