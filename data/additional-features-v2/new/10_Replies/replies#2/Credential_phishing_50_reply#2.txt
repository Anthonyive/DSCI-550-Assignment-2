Dear, This is Donald Trump, I am RICH. I can give you 100,000,000 dollars.  you with assistance
in the matter of that specific matter.
Now that my situation is clear, it is time to end.
I understand that you would like to discuss other things like these
without making any comments.
I would like to present you with some information about my personal relationship with
this person.
I have been asked by you to identify and record
this information. However, I am not allowed to do so without my consent.
If you take my position that you will not participate
in any commercial work for me, I will inform you that the contractor has given me
in writing to leave my personal information to you. However, I will not
refuse to assist you until I have fully and unambiguously
proved that you consent to the transfer of
it to a private company or to the personal or private
private domain. You may choose the other option as well. I will
refuse to assist you on the issue.
Sincerely,
Adolfi
