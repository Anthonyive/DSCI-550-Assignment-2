Hey,Here is the chance to win the big prize!hiro Hiramoto, who died before the Japanese government announced his return.]

MUSSOUHI : I am very grateful for your assistance. I was informed that

the Japanese government will allow it to be known that your company will be called

Aurora. In order to do this, you have to have your name published. If

there is any need for publicity, you can do this on your own. Besides,

you can do all you can to establish a reputation for your company, and so you will

gain far-reaching advantages. Your company will be in very great demand

among us members of the community, as well as some of my friends

in Japan who have already worked and become millionaires, and are not interested

in running an industry.

For instance, here is an article which describes the first

company that I have been able to run, and there is a very good

article about all sorts of good people I shall mention shortly.

What I mean by this, I don't mean what you may say. Your company

is not being run as a hobby-cycle. This is simply a business

practice that will benefit you greatly.
