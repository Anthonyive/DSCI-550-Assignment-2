To whom may concern, YOU ARE THE WINNER!E THE WINNER!

From all who have been in touch with you recently, I will be posting this soon. The results are stunning.


When I first got this job in 1998, I was not expecting to receive the kind of critical acclaim that a person who has "been around the business a long time now" would. But I just loved the work that this company does every single day, and I couldn't be happier for it! The more I read and listened to your comments, the more I felt like I am really getting to know you so well, and I really hope you will be as interested in this job as I am. Thank you!


When I started this business, our employees were all incredibly excited to be featured in the news. We could not have done it without the support of our staff and your support. I am so grateful for your many years of service and loyalty to your company.


Thank you for your continued support, friendship, and care of the family.


Thank you and God bless you as you start your journey through your business.


From a fan of a company that is known for great service.
