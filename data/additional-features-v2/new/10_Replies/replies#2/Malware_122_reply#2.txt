The ANC's National Defence Committee has already set a deadline to release 300,000 people held on a state-run debt of RM3.2 billion for the last two years. The ANC has vowed that it will not give up its fight against corruption.
But the Zimbabwe government has called for an immediate end to Mr. Mugabe's government to replace him.
Mr. Mureya said that he supported the South African ruling party. "People support the ANC. But I think there's a problem with the politicians' rhetoric that's been used to push for better and fairer relations with South Africa.
