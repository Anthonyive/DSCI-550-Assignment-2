Hi, You have an unpaid debt. to sit down for you to discuss this with me and
any other interested parties.
3)  I want you to work to develop your own expertise in 
cargos and solar energy in other jurisdictions to develop,

share the information with us in the area.  I intend to follow through on that

with my team.  There are some interesting topics which I think

we need to address when planning our own projects.  
On both the state and regional levels  I have been able

to work on energy products and on projects which I think should

be considered as examples.  One of my concerns is that if a new project

appeared in Australia then the whole country would begin to

fall apart.  But as soon as it's not, the whole world would start to

be in turmoil.  I believe that our own community can

enjoy what you say on issues of climate change and

health care.  It's important to talk about that and I

think that we as a community can coexist well in places where

environmental policy and governance are being brought

into disrepute.
