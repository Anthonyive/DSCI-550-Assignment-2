To whom may concern, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.

I am not a student at the school and I am not in debt and will stay there in an easy going way.

There is a possibility that the bank will not even pay me.

I will not pay my debts or other debts because they would be a tax evasion because I am a foreign.

I have made this decision based on the facts and is still going to the next of kin when I go back to my home country.

As long as the law does not give a visa for foreigners to enter the country, I will have no choice but to leave my country and head to China.

My lawyer advised me that if I refused to pay this money, his bank would not help me. He said that if he does not accept my claim, it will cause my financial problems.

I cannot go and have a big debt or I will face bad financial situation.

He told me that I am going to be in China in 20 to 30 days to transfer some of this money to the family that he and his family have already made arrangements to leave for, which has only occurred once in 2 years.

The money has been transferred to this bank in the name of the father of the family.
