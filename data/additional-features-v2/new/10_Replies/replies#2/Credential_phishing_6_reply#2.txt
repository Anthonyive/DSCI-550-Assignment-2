To whom may concern, This is Donald Trump, I am RICH. I can give you 100,000,000 dollars. 000 dollars.  You can tell us who you're with, we can get paid whatever you want, I don't give a sh***.  But you can't tell us, we can do whatever you want, I don't give a shit about it. You can't go and tell us what you're for and make that your business card on, they can charge you anything they want to charge you if you're not doing what you say, so you can keep on telling me what's okay. You can't let this bullshit build up and you're not going to be able to do that.You can do all that for us. Don't let this shit get to your heads. They will not pay you any money for this speech. It has nothing to do with anything, I just asked them, "Why are you paying us?" And they will not pay you for it. I ask them if they're on your side with this because I can give you a dollar for every time you say something stupid that I say to you that you hate.  If you wanna come in to help out your cousin, you can put all your money towards that.
And the next day you're saying, "No, he's going to pay you $50,000 for this speech."  He's a Republican. It was never me. It was Senator McCain's father. I never told you that you could give a nickel if you want to. You gave a nickel because you knew you had to, right? Why you're going to be here for the first time in my life. If it didn't start with your father, let's move on.  So here's where we start.  I love you, we love you. I love you to the fullest,
Trump, I'm proud to be here.
Thank you.<|endoftext|>
