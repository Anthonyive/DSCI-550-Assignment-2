Dear, This is Donald Trump, I am RICH. I can give you 100,000,000 dollars. 000 dollars.  The way that all rich and powerful people in America talk about you would change your whole view of life.  In the U.S., when we want money, we need to make sure that our needs are met. You're making sure that we are making sure that we have enough, I want to make sure it is there for everybody. It may seem to be, but we need to know our own needs, and how much, to know how much of it our way is in the world. I am RICH, I know that when we say we will end poverty, we mean that you are fighting to end poverty, and you are fighting to destroy poverty. I think that you know what we all want; and if we are good people who care, we can go with you. The only way we will see you is if we all know what we want. We'll let the world know, "We want a rich guy to take care of the people that we need." And we'll give it to you. We are very proud of how we do. The one thing that I'm still saying is that we want rich people to take care of their families, because rich people take care of everyone. I want you to understand how rich we are and how rich we can be. The only way you can live your life is if you work. You may look for a job. You may look for a place to live. You may look for work. But
