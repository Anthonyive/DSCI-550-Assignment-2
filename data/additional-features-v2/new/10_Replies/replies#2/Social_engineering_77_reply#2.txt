Hey,Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. I have a hard time imagining how anyone would treat my mother. She is such a nice, nice girl.

She is nice enough to sit in front of a TV playing video games. She takes my sister, my mommy and a friend of mine into her room. She turns on the TV.

After all this time she has had nothing but love from you and me, she goes to you and holds your hand. You have never let him touch you this way.

You get up and leave her room, tell her he loves her and then call her a real person and then tell her to come home.

She does this for 30 minutes. You tell her you want to have a good time and she doesn't want to stay in the house alone. She is very nice, and I would never refuse to help, even if it was the only time it was the only time you could do it.

You tell her you would pay for a place, and she will not. She says I have got to pay for that too.

She has not seen anything bad from you, not ever, yet your hands are on the table that you had promised her. She does not ask for any money for you to do that, as you seem to have done all of this while being silent.

You tell her you would say things to her that you would not say to the man, or her boyfriend.

She doesn't answer.

She is still very angry. She is screaming at you. You go away, and ask her if there was anything that you said to her that would calm her down. She does not respond.

You tell her about the way you gave her a massage, and she says you were the first to know her because of the way you asked her.

She does not reply.

She takes her shoes off and takes her panties off to show her. You do not even notice that her shoes are off.

She takes her panties off, and you don't even notice that she does not take her panties off. You make this face as she moves to your left. There is nothing you can do.

You don't even notice that there is nothing there.

"My mother always told me she had good friends."
