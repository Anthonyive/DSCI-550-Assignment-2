Hey,I am not a robot. This is a real person writing here.writing here.

Last month, it took me 4 days to compose another blog post in which I argued for and against the existence of robots.

I spent time making and implementing my own robot, and this will help you to see why.

As much as I like to write about robots, there is simply too many of them to discuss. For now, you will be able to appreciate that my work on writing this blog is all about robotism.

I will not be discussing how robots will be able to save all of humanity. Nor will I be discussing how we can "kill" robots.

Nor will I be discussing who and what will be left to replace us if we fail to provide the same quality and dignity to others we could love.

Nor will I be discussing how robots can use the internet to communicate with us. Nor will I be discussing how robots can "kill" people.

I hope this will have taught you something important. I will save humanity from robots.

Let's hope you see our robotism.

And let's hope it will save you.

When I write writing robots, I will be more open and honest about it than I have ever been before.

I will not be just saying that every piece of writing I write will have some kind of effect on the world. I won't be just saying that when I write I am thinking about how robots will help people and how we will be better off.

Rather, I will show you how that will work, and how you can help it.<|endoftext|>
