Hey,You have an unpaid debt. unpaid debt.

Are you the man you always wanted to be?

You're the person who's been there, seen, and heard...

You've always wanted to be, and you know it's coming, even if it's on the verge. And you just could not make it to the top.

It's getting late because it's still too late.

You know it's late, but you've been waiting.

It's still early.

Your mother wants to talk to you.

You think about everything she said when she got you into the band.

And now, it's time for something different.

If you wanna talk about everything you've said since school, why don't you just write about it and ask me?

But... you can't.

Even if that means you won't write or even try hard enough.

I bet you're tired.

You want to ask me anything.

You want to talk.

If you're not interested.

If you don't.

You're tired.

Do I know what I'm talking about?

Or maybe you already know.

You're tired.

I'd like to go.

And I bet you want to see if you can get through this.

If you think you can.
