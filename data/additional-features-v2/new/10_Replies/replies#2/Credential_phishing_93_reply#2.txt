Dear Citizens

Since you are asking for our help in reporting your issue, we have developed a service to assist you in doing so. The Citizens Action Center is here to provide a resource that is geared toward citizen-friendly activities. You can call any of the following toll-free numbers at (614) 549-5977 to have the group answered.

Please note, when the volunteers first receive your case, they will be given 2-5 minutes to respond by calling (614) 549-5977, or logging on to their website at www.www.CitizensActionCenter.org/victimservice.

Thank you for your interest. We look forward to hearing from you soon!
