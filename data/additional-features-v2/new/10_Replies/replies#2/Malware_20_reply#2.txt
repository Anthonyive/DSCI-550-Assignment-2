To whom may concern, This is Donald Trump, I am RICH. I can give you 100,000,000 dollars.  an associate with the College of Business two years before I became Dean of Business. I feel that this has been a difficult choice, I have spent my life on campus and have the passion to do my best to help the future graduates who may not yet have a chance to work at a university. Many of my classmates have contacted me for help or offered me jobs. Most have even told me that they feel good about their job or that they want to join the college. I believe that it is important to find someone who is willing to take my place and not a burden to go to a university and find someone who is genuinely committed to you. While I wish to work with everyone I have met and even more important, I also believe that there are better places to live and do things. I will continue to work at the university and work on my future projects, but I believe that these future careers are important.
So there you have it!
Now let's get to work! This is what I hope to do. I hope to give you some of the details I have shared in my previous posts to give you a better sense of what I believe the best place I am to be is in the future of college and in the future of all the others I have discussed
