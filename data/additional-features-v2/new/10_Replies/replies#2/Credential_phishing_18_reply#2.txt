Hello, Urgency Alert, please reply within 3 dayswithin 3 days as we have to finish the job,

The site's administrator confirmed with a spokesperson:

"To be clear we have asked Urgent Alert's owner and CEO to assist in cleaning up the site with repairs to the walls and ceilings. This is the first time that we have offered this help."

The site already has some work done, and a lot of work has been done, but there's no going back into a closed door business when the site needs to be repaired. To put it simply: there is no need to open that door or give a repair that you can just tell is being done to Urgent Alert.

The site needs a new toilet, which it is currently struggling with, as the cost for getting one is, from the start, higher than anywhere else. Urgent Alert has to do its part to fix that problem. I hope that, since this site just launched, they have had an answer to the matter before they shut the doors on the site when they're about to open the doors and repair it.

I hope that you all find them to be as nice as Urgent Alert's.
