Dear, We are good people. good people.  But we can't talk to you about the problems. As a group we are not in need.  We are not in need.   And we are not in need.  A society that expects us to conform to its standards, values and expectations is a society that cannot offer us a space to express our individuality and create a community or a community to which we are only welcome. It is a society that cannot be a place for any group with the same set of ideals.  And I cannot tell you why.  I have a sense of failure with which I am going to deal with my life.  I have learned much, perhaps very little, about what is wrong with American society.  I know that there are too many flaws and  we can not understand them because of our own problems. I also know that there are ways around problems.  We all need to figure out who we are and we need to work together to address the problems we face. I mean really really fucking hard.  We need to be able to live together in a more responsible way.  And there are so many things the United States cannot do because of its lack of human rights.  Our borders are open borders to everyone, and we can only do what we want.  And I want to tell you about our country. I mean like I said, so many people in this country are stupid and mean and not human. They think they are fighting for their country and they want to be treated like the rest of us.  In fact the only thing that makes them different is that they are the reason why people stop coming to our state and stop coming to our state because they want to be treated better.  So if there is one thing we can do, it is to make America a place where people can live together, to share in each other's success, to find common ground and to create shared values.  And that is exactly what we need to do.  We need to work together.  That is exactly what we have been
