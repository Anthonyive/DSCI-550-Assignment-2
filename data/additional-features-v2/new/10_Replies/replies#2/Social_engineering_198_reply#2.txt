Hey,You have a package in Fedex, please call us back!  wealth and protection for all of mankind. I am an American citizen who has not done business in China and who has not attended U.S. Embassy or U.S. Embassy in Shanghai.
I am also the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Y. W. Wawrinka, and I am a retired professor at the Chinese National Institute of Technology.
This is my first formal relationship with China. But the time is right. I will continue to call for the U.N. to follow through and that I expect to receive the full attention and support of the American people, with the assistance of all my friends and acquaintances and in my view, with the help of every Chinese citizen in China.
Sincerely,
Thank you,<|endoftext|>
