Dear, Your grandfather has left you a heritage. This is not good for the business community. I don't think that the system is really working for you if you are not able to make friends, especially among other people. You are not helping the business community, and as I understand it, that means that not only do you not help the business community in the long run, but that you are trying to undermine them. For years I have come to understand that the university system is just not capable of being the same as its members, and that the business community needs to work with their school and with the university to create a more efficient and more harmonious place for students in the university system. You can find a business that is like it. There is a lot of talent here that has not been recognized so far, and they will be judged on merit; and in this short time you could have a really competitive business. I am very glad that the university is working to produce better education for my students. It is really unfortunate that this has gotten so involved. It is sad that it is so easy to find people who want to be entrepreneurs, and to see them going to university with the most amount of effort and the greatest energy, when they have not done all they could in so many years. But I am glad
