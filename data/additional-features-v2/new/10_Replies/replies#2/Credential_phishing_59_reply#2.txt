YoYour father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.
I have been in charge of the information and deposits of a company that was awarded a successful payment contract with the Nigerian Government for the transfer of money into the country of origin of the foreign person who was awarded the contract.
I am the one who has to first collect the necessary documentation, and secondly inform the US Government about the contract awarded to the company.
I am the one who has to write the contract.
I am hoping that you will be the one to assist me in this transaction.
I have been a member of the Advisory Committee on Financial Services since 1998, and I am now the Director of Account Management for the bank by the name of the Bank of Nigeria Bank of Nigeria.
It is your responsibility to obtain all relevant documentation regarding payment on behalf of you or for your purposes in connection with the payment, deposit or transmission of funds to or from the company.
You should write to the name of the company that received the payment and, if you do not receive a response from the company within 5 business days, you should mail your payment to the name of the person in charge, that received the transaction.
The payment you receive for your use as an account administrator should be provided to the Nigerian Government and should be reported to the Nigerian Foreign
