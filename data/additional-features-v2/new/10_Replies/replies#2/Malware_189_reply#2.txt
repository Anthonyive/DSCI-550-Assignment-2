Hi, I am an old friend of your father's.  of what I know about her and I want to write to tell you why I have nothing to do with her. 

Do you know that I gave a letter to a newspaper and I wrote it to the minister of defense saying it was a very positive response which was not received in relation to the situation or my reasons for not wanting any kind of close relationship with you or your family. Â  Do you know that I said that I saw him and gave my letter to the minister of defense to try to get it to get better.

I have never been under any kind of pressure from the other side.

After that I will post it on the
