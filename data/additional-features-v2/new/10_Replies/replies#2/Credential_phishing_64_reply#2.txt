Hello, Please provide me your bank account number and the 3 digits on the back. on the back.  If you can't get one there are many other ways.  I am going to post pictures from this. I just want to make a statement on the back. I will not be able to send this money. (my apologies in advance.)  I will not be able to send your name and address.  Please send your photos by snail mail to: dana@baskervoir.com or by email to dana@baskervoir.com. Note, no photos taken with this can be sent back to the credit card you pay via. I have asked this on multiple occasions so keep in mind that I did not do this on purpose to make money off of this.  Just to clarify to you, I am not in my 70s so I cannot afford to lose some of the money to pay for a trip to the airport. I hope that you can take my word for it. I will make sure I understand.<|endoftext|>
