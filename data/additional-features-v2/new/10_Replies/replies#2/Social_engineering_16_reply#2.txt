The police station located at 618 W. Oldham St., S.I., had been recently inspected by authorities for a missing person. The search team came upon records from the state police listing the address of the police station, along with the telephone number of the police station. It was on a desk marked "S.I."

"On March 27, 1971, Maj. Brokaw traveled to the area of the incident and met with the police to report that the incident at 9 p.m. on March 27 was not a case of mistaken identity," the SBI wrote in a press release about the incident. It was later noted that the caller to the area who reported the shooting was a man with a long hair.

The documents also indicated that one day before the shooting had taken place, Major Brokaw and his friend David Okereff visited a local hospital that
