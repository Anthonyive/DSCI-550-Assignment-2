An international group of 50 scientists from 11 countries are joining a United Nations special task force to tackle the global climate change crisis by looking to develop tools to identify, manage and protect the global carbon emission level. The group was founded by Professor Mike Mora, a co-director at Yale University's Center for Climate Change Communication, and colleagues, including UN Environment Programme coordinator and lead researcher Professor Paul Beaumont, are co-authors.

Professor Mora and his team are looking for ways to help make sure that the world's climate crisis is contained, and as a result, can be addressed through policies that are based on public policies. These policies, though, would have to be tailored to the global economy and can have to address the carbon emissions that we generate each year. "We believe that any set of government or commercial actions that we find to affect those emissions is a threat to the very life and sustainability of our planet," says Mora. "This is what we're going to be looking to do here."

As part of this effort, the United Nations is working on a national global plan which would focus on policies and strategies to reduce carbon emissions and protect the world's forests and coastal states in order to meet global needs. The goal is to achieve emissions reductions from 2020 to 2030 and the first
