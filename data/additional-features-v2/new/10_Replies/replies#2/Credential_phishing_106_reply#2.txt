YoWe are good people. good people. 

A few weeks ago we posted a series of articles on how to set up an Android Developer Developer Platform. Recently, the topic has come up again – the question is 'how do we set up an Android Developer Developer Platform?'  I want to get some thoughts on how this idea could work and in what possible way.

As usual, we've taken the simple approach. We all want to have a working product and there are a ton of people in the community who don't like that kind of platform. So with that in mind, we thought it would be fun to take some steps to make our own Android Developer Developer Platform.

So, we need to pick an Android phone to support. When we pick the phone, we don't even have to know it for a moment. We could have just used the launcher.

Now, let's put it all together to create a phone.

The basic steps, we're going to do is create an app. In our case our app will be available in the Google Play Store.

First thing we want to do is get it installed. If we do get it installed, we can do something about it, like add some additional features to the app or add a new version.

Next step, we'll create a test app. We'll put it in a test folder. We will then do the same with the development code.

Now we just need to create a test app and run it.
