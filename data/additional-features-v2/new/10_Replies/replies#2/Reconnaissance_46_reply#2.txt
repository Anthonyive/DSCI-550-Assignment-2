Hi, YOU ARE THE WINNER!E THE WINNER!

I took some pictures before i finished the photo shoot.

I knew it would be super easy but for some reason i think it was more time consuming

So i went home and finished the photo and all I need to do is post some pictures.

I also took an album (so far i think i took 3 albums as well):

i need to make it big

I want to keep the same format

As my photos is bigger so I can see the best photos i can

so here is the way i put it. I have not finished all the photos but i will start working on this when it is finished and i hope that it is your best.<|endoftext|>
