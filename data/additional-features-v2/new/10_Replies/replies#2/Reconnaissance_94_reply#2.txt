Hi, Your grandfather has left you a heritage. go from here as if I had never arrived, but I will not let anything affect me. I will not give myself to the kind of temptation of a divorce because I know that if I do, I won't make a lasting peace with it. I'm not even going to consider doing it for the sake of my children or my property or anything else. I'll do my best for them and I won't make a deal on money. I just want to help as much as possible to make sure that I take what I can of my kids, and put everything on hold for some time.I've found that I could give my daughters even more and I would like them to understand that they are so much more than what they really need. It won't happen for a while and they have already become more comfortable with the idea of it and it would be too much for them to take for granted. My husband, we have our own home, I have a home with no children and I just want to make sure they feel happy and satisfied as the next parents.I want to say thank you very much for your time and consideration and your decision to send this letter today is truly a step forward for us as well as for any of our families. I thank everyone for
