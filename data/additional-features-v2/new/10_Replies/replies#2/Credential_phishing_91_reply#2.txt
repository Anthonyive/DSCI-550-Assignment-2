This tournament will be held in February 2013. On the same day, you will receive 2 official, exclusive screenshots and a short synopsis of each game. We are so sorry for that because it is quite hard to make time to play the game. This game was first created on the 3rd of February. We were waiting for the third game and then finally it was announced on 3rd of February for our third year in this game's life. The first playable version of The Dark Age was announced at the 4th of February. It is planned to be released in early 2013.

If you want to go for one of these, you need to register an email at the tournament registration page from the email address given for your game to receive these bonuses.

We will send you one screenshot, the details of the game are explained below:


The original version of The Dark Age took 10-15 months to be played, but we hope that you enjoy this amazing piece of entertainment!<|endoftext|>
