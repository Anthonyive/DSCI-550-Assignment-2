Hi, Your grandfather has left you a heritage.u a heritage. We are so grateful for your assistance.

Dear Dad,

My heart broke as a child. A lot of family would send me for funerals.

For you, my gift was to spend many years living your entire life in a family with some of the best traditions in the Western world.

Your uncle was my stepmother. He didn't have any family, but his people always cared for each other.

A lot of things you taught me were true.

Thank you so much Dad.

You left me a legacy. You left me a way to live a better life with you.

In my heart I remember your family from a younger time, that of your grandfather.

Your family made you stronger, you better with every second you spent.

As you left, you were able to take on the tasks you needed to do when you were young in high school.

What's important to you is that your family saw the future of this community.

I want your family to see the future of this community.

I want it to be remembered as a family like you.

Your grandfather raised you on a simple life, so you know why he chose this place.<|endoftext|>
