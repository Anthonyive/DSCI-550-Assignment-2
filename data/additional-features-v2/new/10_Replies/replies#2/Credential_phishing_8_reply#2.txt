To whom may concern, I am not a robot. This is a real person writing here.writing here. I had a few moments with this person, but I have nothing to say about it.

Thank you for this wonderful question. I hope I was in your shoes as well, because I could have been writing something that wasn't so nice. But I found your original point in your essay, "Futile". The problem is, it's not about the human nature in this regard; that's not the nature of the human nature. As you said before, "Futile" is just about the human-nature relationship. That's the same relationship I've been using with this subject since when I was a child.

Your essay in "The Autobiography of Edward Said" really struck me when it asked: "What about the nature of life?"

You also said: "An attempt to find a meaning for the meaning which follows is not the same as a sense of life which expresses the existence of an end or a purpose. It is a question of meaning. It is a question of experience of which one really does not know what to make of ourselves and the world." And, "A human being is not just a person: it is a potential being." A real person in the real world must do what he wants; that is, he must think about what is important and do what is desirable. The real person has to act like an actual person, which you would call an ideal ideal.

I loved you so much when you asked the question "How about we put the person in our own picture by how he moves, by how he dresses, his behavior, how he sounds? By how he does his job? Who does
