Hi, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. They've been together for 19+ years now, and all three of us were kids from South Korea. He always had a few, but it was just not good. He said that the only thing he could do was to raise our daughter. I gave up and I turned in my old phone, I just gave up all hope. I'll keep getting on Google, but I've forgotten about my old phone and there are things on it that won't work, just no good. So I want to move on...I'm getting a new phone, which is not going to be fast, because I'm looking for some better value, but I've not heard from a company on who could give me that phone. I'll still need to go out to a friend, but I'm not going back to work until I'm done with it. I'm afraid that the phone will be gone forever, because I'm not going to be able to take my children anywhere, especially since the kids are now 9 years old. I've only heard from a couple that could give me a phone, and it sounds good. I would like to make a phone, but I do not have the funds to do so at the moment. Do you have a better idea?<|endoftext|>
