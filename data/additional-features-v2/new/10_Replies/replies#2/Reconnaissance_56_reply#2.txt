Choe Ryong-dae will not be allowed to work in North Korea any more, for some time. He will return to Pyongyang.
While Choe Ryong-dae's case was filed in the U.S., in North Korea in July 2008, North Korean prosecutors also filed charges against two of his co-conspirators in retaliation for the US's failure to extradite and prosecute Choe Ryong-dae.
Following his release from prison, Choe Ryong-dae now resides in Seoul where he is still accused of participating in the crime. He had been arrested twice for a crime he committed in 2008. The latter time he had been prosecuted. The US government refused to extradite and prosecute Choe Ryong-dae.
The other co-conspirator in the case was Hui Chang-hye-dae, who was sentenced to six years on Monday on charges of racketeering and financial crimes (pay and transfer to a foreign criminal organization). He had also been indicted on numerous other charges and was charged with financial crimes, financial misconduct, and financial crimes as well as other charges.<|endoftext|>
