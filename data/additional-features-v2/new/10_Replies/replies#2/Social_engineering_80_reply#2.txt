Hey,I am not a robot. This is a real person writing here.writing here. I'm a woman and I live in London, UK. I am a member of the International Association of Robot Engineers and a female engineer from the UK, and I can't take anything seriously.I am writing to ask some questions if there is anyone who has read a post here or any of my other articles so as not to make them harder to answer because I know others might find my statements off-topic. I might need to stop sending questions to anyone in any language. I am not interested in a huge number of questions, but if there are questions that are very clear and interesting, then this is something I may need to start getting my feet wet a bit. (I was thinking about writing an article about my experience at the Robot Fair in London a while back, just to clear things up as to what I know from my previous experiences, where I was at and how I changed. In addition, if you go and talk to other people on this topic, ask about their experiences as well as my thoughts on that topic, and hopefully I can get some more feedback from you. Thanks in advance for reading, please keep an eye out! )<|endoftext|>
