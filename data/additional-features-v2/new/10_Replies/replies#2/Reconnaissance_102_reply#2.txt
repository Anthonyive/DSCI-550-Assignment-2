YoI can give you $500 Target gift card. the lack of financial support, I want to dedicate myself more to this company instead of continuing on with an "unconditional" job offer.

But I can see that if I can find an employment agreement with Myllena and my partner that is less stressful, perhaps I will be able to leave my previous job at "lifestyle", and return home to my family and take advantage of those many benefits, and enjoy my time at home.

Myllena has also made it clear that she is going to return to the project immediately and will need to be paid for it in full. And he will have his own personal expenses, so I would like to dedicate myself as an entrepreneur. I am very happy that I will not have to pay for any future work with "elite" service.<|endoftext|>
