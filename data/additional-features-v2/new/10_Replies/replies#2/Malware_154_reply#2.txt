Hey,I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's.  My father passed away.  He had died of leukemia almost 2 years ago and had no cure, but had given up fighting for his life.  He was battling his leukemia and decided to go on a long walk, hoping to make a comeback to save his son.  My father came back to his father's life on April 9, 2010 after 1 year in a wheelchair.  It was only that it didn't heal.  His blood work was completely gone (he got a kidney transplant after only about 6 months of treatment and is currently receiving 100 percent of his usual bodyweight), and his health has since returned to normal.  His health started improving about 1 year ago.  He has a new job today that has helped him to go back on a full-time job with a large family.  The one thing that kept me feeling old was that he wanted to make good friends with my new friends.   It was the only thing that kept me sad that I was never able to be the type of guy he wanted to be around.  I can't believe we could live this long without our brother and sister, so that is very nice to me. I am going to miss him so much as I am going to miss what he stood for.<|endoftext|>
