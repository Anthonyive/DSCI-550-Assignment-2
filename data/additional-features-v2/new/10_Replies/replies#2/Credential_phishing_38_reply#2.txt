The organization is called the Council for Cuban Affairs. They are the representatives of the Cuban people and the United Nations.
They are part of the Cuban government, and they were put on trial to go to Cuba. They are not allowed to return or to pay any tax and I believe they will not pay any. They are very, very afraid of this country and it is being run by foreign agents.
