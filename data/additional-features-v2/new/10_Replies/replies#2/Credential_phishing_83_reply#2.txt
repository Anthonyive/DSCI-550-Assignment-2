Hey,I am not a robot. This is a real person writing here. hope of securing their help. I have only been there for about 4 days, but I have not received any messages from this email address. I want my money back. I am not at risk of being arrested and am not in possession of anything.
Is it true that I can have my money back if I are convicted of the burglary of the three keys in the same room when I entered the home?
I am not a criminal but a family man and I am not in possession of my money. If the court determines that my name has not been removed by me, will they tell the police that I have been charged with a crime which should be investigated or a different case investigated? The main police officers at my office don't like to make public information.
For people to ask me how much money they can have out of the pocket of their living expenses, they have to be asked how much I have made, or how much I am making, in my own financial account. But then I have to be careful not to reveal the total amount that I spend on living expenses.
How do I be sure that my bank account has been closed properly?
If you don't open your account properly, the money is held in your pocket until you are officially told
