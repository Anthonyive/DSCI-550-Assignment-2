Hi, I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's. Â My mother worked for your father in a hospital for several years. I have to admit, in my childhood, I was very very unhappy with the treatment you gave me and the way your mother treated me in that hospital. This was an illness that affected me personally. I did not wish to use physical or emotional abuse against anyone and I loved those few times you gave me and did not get what I wanted. Your father did a fantastic job working for your mother during this time and after the trauma he helped to bring about a new and bright day for us. You were the best and a very caring father, I can honestly say I have been grateful to be here and supported with what you did to me in the last week. I am really so grateful. Thank you for all of the gifts that you put into your life, and hope you have as well. Thanks for all you do for this wonderful person in our family.<|endoftext|>
