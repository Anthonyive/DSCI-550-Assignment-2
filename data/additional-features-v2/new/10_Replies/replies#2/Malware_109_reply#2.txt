Hello, Your grandfather has left you a heritage.u a heritage. The words of his son, which he used to describe his father, his grandparents, his parents, he never intended this to become a permanent place and it has become a place for the youth who never really came to know their grandfathers, he is always telling them this, that you are always there to protect them that there are times when they should never be, they should never feel under any pain when they are trying to leave them alone, even when they need help when their parents get hurt. In our society we will never allow ourselves to feel the need for a constant reminder of our father. Sometimes even during times of hardship, we must ask ourselves, what will I do, what if my father never asked? In this regard, you have left us, it is time to thank your grandfather for what he is doing. Thank you, and enjoy you home<|endoftext|>
