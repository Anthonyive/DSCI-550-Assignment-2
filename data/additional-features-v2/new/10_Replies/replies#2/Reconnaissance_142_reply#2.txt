Hey,Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago. put up by our government in the form of investments. We lost about $500,000 of this money on loans, $300,000 on construction contracts. Our partner and I did not pay this kind of money due to financial considerations. In my view, this move is part of the government's political and economic scheme of selling assets. Our trust to this end was established as a subsidiary company, and I am glad that there is now transparency at this level and we are on track to reduce our losses and bring the total loss to at least $3.5 billion.
These loans were provided by our investors. The loans were used to buy other companies, to purchase machinery, factories, etc. The loans were being loaned to these companies to do its work and thus made the money available. In that sense, our funds were being used to finance this activity.
So, if we do not understand the government's and India's policies and our partners' ways of life, I think that we will not have the funds to compete with other nations for market share on which to develop companies. It is very important to understand how much this has come to light.
We are still waiting to hear from Mr. Kaur. We have no idea about our financing arrangements
