Hey,Urgency Alert, please reply within 3 days (that I was shot with an automatic weapon). It hit my right side bone. The bullet hit my right arm.
I was in my home, the house with the bullet. My wife and I were just outside my home when it hit. I saw a person walking in my front yard with his back to me.
The person ran towards me.
I was just a bit down and scared. We tried to hold up our hands, but the person would never give up trying to push us, he just wanted me to go away.
The bullet hit my arm and it started bleeding. I had my arm cut and my brain (to cut my brain) injured. I tried to pull out my left arm to try to hold it up for the bullet to penetrate it. I can tell you the bullet started bleeding even though I didn't have my blood pressure level right now. So it was too early to try to pull it out.
My husband and I tried to pull him off the bullet, but the person had tried to pull us off the bullet, they started hitting on our house too.
I was trying to hold on and try to hold on until a nurse arrived. She said she would only let me go to the hospital as the bullet would
