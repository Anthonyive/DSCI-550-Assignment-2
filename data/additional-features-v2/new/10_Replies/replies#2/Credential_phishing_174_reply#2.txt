To whom may concern, I can give you $500 Target gift card.et gift card. As soon as I receive the card it will be taken by the store to my local Walmart. At that time you will be notified and I have your mailing address.

I have a good idea for all things Walmart and they need to know how to help. As much as I love this place (I use to be the only one in there!) but you know that I have a little something extra in my life waiting for me. A great and very simple gift card in my gift cabinet with nothing special that may actually be used for buying groceries and things.

I am so happy and excited to receive that I am doing all the work of a person and for the first time I have a credit card. So, to answer your questions about my gift and my plans for the future I think the best way to summarize is with the link in my post.

I know what you guys have been asking about the money I have in my gift cabinet. So I am going to keep getting the mail I received from you. The good news is that I have been given a great email which means I get to tell you what my plan is for that. So now I have a better idea and you are going to love it!

How many other gifters don't share your story of how they can get away with stealing $100 of your stuff but still get caught by the law? Do you want to know why or even how they can steal something that could save $3,000? Don't worry, I have answered all your questions!

If you like what you see or understand what this means, then feel free to share.
