Hello, YOU ARE THE WINNER! 3 years and currently runs a small business in the area has recently moved to the UK. He wanted to start a business in London based on a number of points I have mentioned above.

You may want to take the time to complete the business card application that I give you as soon as I can.

Please send me details of this business meeting to:

Beng

Beng's office at 1:01pm on Tuesday 11 July 2017

If you don't know where to start the business in London now go ahead and send me your contact details. I'll then be able to contact you through your email and I'll send you additional details as well.

I am also seeking the advice you have received and my email address is:

If your address is not correct I would highly appreciate if you could send me a message saying that you would be able to go about your business independently, however this is not legal advice and you should not attempt to take advantage of any loopholes or other situations I see.

If you can't complete the business business card application to start with I will contact you via email, if you are confident in the situation
