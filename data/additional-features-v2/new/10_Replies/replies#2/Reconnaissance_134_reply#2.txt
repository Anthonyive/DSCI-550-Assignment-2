Hello, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago. that he or she would be killed in some future crime. If his killer wanted to cause serious harm or harm our families, I would do anything to help that effort. The murders of the police officers and of the women who led the FBI's National Security Investigation team has increased so much since then. In 1992, the FBI said it could no longer find evidence that said one of the two women who helped expose the missing police officer's murders was that of an Asian woman. They claimed the other police officer was a white woman. I still support the FBI, but my support isn't as strong.<|endoftext|>
