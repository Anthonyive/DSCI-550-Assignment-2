Hi, YOU ARE THE WINNER!E THE WINNER!

We have been playing with our games in some of the past months. We love the challenge of playing a game in a game community. The community is awesome and we hope that your team also has some fun playing with your cards.


We have created a new playtest page and are now looking to have people play with your cards online.


Our game is called "The Art" and all you have to do is copy one of our cards. If we reach out to any of you and get you to go through the page and get back to the game with your cards, this is what we're going to do in the near future.


Your input will have very beneficial effects in this campaign so please keep it up to date as we progress.<|endoftext|>
