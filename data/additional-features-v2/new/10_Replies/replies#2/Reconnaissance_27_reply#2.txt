YoYou have a package in Fedex, please call us back! all us back! ------------- It has been 2 years in the making. ------------- I just put together a new custom package for my little dog. ------------- The first package we received was an SS and they were so cute that they did everything. I would never forget the first time I played with my dogs. They love it and they got it for me. Thank you from Fedex for all of you! Also, please keep checking back frequently for a newer version! Thanks so much to each and every one of you and thank you again again to everyone in the program!<|endoftext|>
