Hi, Your grandfather has left you a heritage.
As far as I know, the only official government response that has been received has been to respond to the petition with a clarification.
What is the reason for the demand to have the money transferred from Zimbabwe to the International Banks?
The reasons why the international bank account in South Africa was not affected are: (1) that South Africa does not have all its funds in the bank, therefore funds in the country of origin have to be sent in a safe as well as in a transparent and independent manner in exchange of the funds and (2) there is no way for these funds, and therefore international banks should not have access to it, to keep it in safe as well as in a transparent and independent manner. If South Africa cannot process the funds in its international bank account in order to allow it to receive the funds in its local bank account, then the funds should be transferred from the international bank account into Africa, and the funds should not be transferred from Africa to the South African bank account. The International Banks, in particular, need to consider the security and security measures and they need to make decisions about the security and security measures.
Since the decision by the Central Bank is in terms of which bank, if all funds from the bank are transferred to South Africa
