To whom may concern, YOU ARE THE WINNER! you think.
This letter is an unofficial version of an official document that was prepared with the consent of the State Department in 2010. I have read the entire document and cannot accept any revisions to it. This is not my opinion as I cannot agree with all the opinions of all of the US government officials involved.
I do not agree with any one of the official line of thinking as they will see no justification for using us as an intermediary.
Please note, I cannot publish any information, data or documents that I do not agree with, for political or other reasons or for my personal personal personal purposes.
Thank You for Reading
