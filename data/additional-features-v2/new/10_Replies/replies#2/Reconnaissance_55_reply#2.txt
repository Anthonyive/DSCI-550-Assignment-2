Hey,Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. His love for me had gotten so bad and I had no idea I was living a different world, that I had to leave, but he finally gave me a chance.Now I'm living with my father, and my parents have grown so much together. I feel a sense of great responsibility and honor in being my own husband and the mother of my kids. My love for you and my children will not be gone forever, and you will have the full and absolute support from my family.<|endoftext|>
