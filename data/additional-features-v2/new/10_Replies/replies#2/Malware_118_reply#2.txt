Hi, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. I knew this because he told me about the tragedy he suffered from and how he got divorced from my wife when we met. So I came up with this suggestion: Go online and ask my father what happened and if he'd still be alive today.

You should tell him about these 10 days. Don't worry. He is safe!

I was wondering if I could post on Facebook with his answers, just to get a few more replies about what happened.

(Also, I'm just trying to get some ideas.)

The best way to put this together is to think about all that you do:

1. Create.

2. Find your family, get married, get kids, etc. The main thing you really want to do is write for the person who's going to say to you "You are a beautiful woman."

3. Read all the books you have and think about how you can make a difference in people's lives. Don't just start with one. Take your own idea a step further and create a plan that you can use to influence people. Write something out about your family and the life situation you see.

4. Talk about the things you want. Write things that you know you will do and then add information to this in a way that you'll use more often with friends, family, and other family members around you.

5. Be honest with your family and make sure you understand everything they say about you and everything they see and understand how important that is.

6.
