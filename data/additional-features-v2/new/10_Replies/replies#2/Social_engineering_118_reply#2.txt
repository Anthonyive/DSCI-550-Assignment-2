Hey,Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. I had my first baby in 11 years in June of 1994 with no history. My mother has been in nursing and this is the first time she has gone through any medical transition for some time after she was born.My mom was in an induced coma after the birth and her head was removed in 2007 and I am very upset.She went into surgery to remove her head but all she could do was cry and cry in pain.My father is an accountant and I met him in his college years. We started over there.He worked with all kinds of people in the business.He is the first business owner in the UK to become part of a UK healthcare company.I have a special interest in the UK food system and in health.We are an online food chain who helps with people's hygiene issues in the UK.We are a food and healthcare company.We make sure the UK is healthy for food and medicine. We have been in the UK for 5 years. I am not sure when we will be able to return the US home.This is the only place where we have met our potential customers. In many cases the food and healthcare business is part of a larger health service enterprise. I am a member of the Food Service Corporation of the UK. We have a large section of the food service industry. We have worked very closely with suppliers to make sure they are all fully in service. Food industry workers pay for the preparation of all product and food in order to ensure safety and sustainability in the food supply chain.We have been in business for a long time and have managed to bring together quite a number of businesses in the UK. I have no doubt we will find a buyer and I cannot wait to take ownership of this business.This is the best time I have known in my life.The business in the US I have not looked back. We worked closely with my husband for several years and I am pleased
