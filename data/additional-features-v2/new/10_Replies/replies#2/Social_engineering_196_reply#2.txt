Dear, Your grandfather has left you a heritage.u a heritage.


As I write, I will have nothing to do with your return. In fact, my family is quite familiar with what happened to yours in a previous generation.


That is, while my grandfather was alive when he left you the estate, he did not, under a state of emergency, leave the village with you.


When he did, some of the villagers and his wife had to leave. My grandfather left for the mainland in late summer of 1991, and my father, who lived there for the rest of his life, left for New Zealand in April of 1993. That is, until this year.


I have nothing to do with your disappearance, no. However, I have a lot more to do with the fact that you will not return. Your grandfather's name will be placed in the history of the family.


My grandfather, his family, and I will continue to maintain you and care for you with the hope that you will never be forgotten. As I write this, I see that all my activities in this world will remain, for all that I have been.<|endoftext|>
