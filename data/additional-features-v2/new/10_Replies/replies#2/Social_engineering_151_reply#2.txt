To whom may concern, You have an unpaid debt. have been involved in extortion and money laundering in India, which has been in the news in recent times.
There are also a number of other criminal activities, but I will give you this information. 
One of the main issues is the foreign fighters operating their money services in India have been known to go to many places, such as bank accounts, in order to send the money to their families. 
Also we know that foreign fighters have also been seen abroad to exchange money with other foreign fighters, such as making large sums in the country's currencies, with the money from other banks.
And these foreign fighters are suspected to be involved in the extortion and money laundering of foreign nationals in Indian state and abroad.
On this, there is no information about how long the foreign fighters have been in India.
That should lead the authorities to think that the criminals are in control of the entire country.
Second, they must know that the money made in the country is being used by foreign criminals and they must know what their target is. 
And for some people foreign fighters that would be bad for them. And there is no reason to suspect that those foreign fighters are operating under the influence of drugs. 
To this I will give you this information.
