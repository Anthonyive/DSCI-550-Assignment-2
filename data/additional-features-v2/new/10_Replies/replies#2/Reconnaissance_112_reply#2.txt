Hi, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. Her former friends called the police. I told them I was tired, worried, and embarrassed. My mother gave a big "We are sorry" to me, but nothing came of it. There was no contact between them and my father about this. It seems that his friends did not understand his situation.

My father did not live a happy life. His wife and two daughters were very depressed. He even had a pet bull (Heres a pictures of a dog with a horn on it for your viewing pleasure). He has also been very kind to his daughters (she loves cats too) and her friends (they don't understand him) and the kids are very well. He is a good friend for everyone. They tell me that he does things to relieve himself with other people, to make people happy, to give them space and make them care for me, and this is not to his liking. He doesn't understand that everyone is affected by his attitude, that everyone is unhappy. I think this is why he started a movement to help me.

I have tried not to tell anyone. But as a husband, I do not want to say sorry or any kind of "Sorry for what?" Because I want to give you and my family peace.

I did not make any money from it for 10 years. But after one year I was able to start collecting a living on my own without any money from my parents. At the time, my father was very poor, working long hours. His life was going bad and he worked his shift from work and weekends. So his two daughters are also very poor and didn't get much money. So at one time he had this money to take care of them. This got more and more annoying and became very bitter. So after 10 years, my money never returned. My house was broken down and I am not allowed to even have my own
