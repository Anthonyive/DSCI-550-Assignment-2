YoWe are good people.  money is in a Swiss bank account. You can only prove that it is Swiss money.
The letters you have sent in response to this letter and those you have submitted to the Sion family appear to reveal one thing:
That the Rothschilds have been the biggest source of income to these families. I know I must point out that a very big amount of money has gone to the Rothschilds since the early days of Britain to support the British family.
They were established in 1640 by Louis XIV of France.
They began with the British Rothschilds and rose up to become the world's largest and most powerful bank.
They used all the resources of their family to fight against a world government and all the world's politicians that were trying to do what was right for the British Empire.
In 1817 they established the Royal Bank of Scotland, which was the largest and most influential bank in the world. It still stands today.
They founded the financial crisis which was carried on by George II of France in the spring of 1817.
On September 1, 1817 the British Royal Bank of Scotland was officially dissolved by the British Parliament and its Secretary, Sir John White, was given the job of Secretary of the Treasury by King George III.
