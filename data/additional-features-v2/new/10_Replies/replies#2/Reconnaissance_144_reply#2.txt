YoYour grandfather has left you a heritage. a firm stand on many, many of the issues of a very difficult situation. One of the things that I have been working very hard on and that has made my work in this field, is to be an open book. There is more that is hidden in the information in this book. One thing that is very evident in this book, is that the Church has not stopped moving towards a better direction. It has not been very peaceful, it is not in harmony. I cannot help thinking that perhaps this has more to do with the fact that my family has not accepted what we know. I hope that in the future, that this new information that I am receiving, that this information that I am learning is not just simply not right, but that people of faith who work under such strong circumstances may try to come forward and help find answers, and even try to be part of the new organization.

So, I hope this is helpful. I want to bring you in line with how I feel about the new organization, and my thoughts on this article, that I received this week. So, for now, go ahead and read with me that information, and I feel it will be helpful to you, for it may be helpful to me in your future endeavors.<|endoftext|>
