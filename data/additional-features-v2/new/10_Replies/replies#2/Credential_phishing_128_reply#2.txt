Hey,I am an old friend of your father's.  own financial accounts. They have both used their own accounts for that reason.
These calls have not stopped me from doing this.
I have said this every time this deal came in.
I will never take a big sale because I love the customers who are so grateful to receive these great deals.
Many of them still don't even know the price of the product.
They don't want a big deal. I wish for a better deal on the new product.
How much money can I have on one account for a 10 day deal on one time and not another for another?
I have read about this in the Wall Street Journal. I don't want to admit it.
However, there are still some people who still don't know the price of the deal.
This has nothing to do with my actions or my own personal interests but to serve as a warning sign that you need to put all of your attention onto your product and not on other people.
If you will take a big sale for one reason and then move to another place for a $10,000 deal on a different time, if you will not do what the law says you can do, then there is no hope of winning any big deal with people like that.
