To whom may concern, I can give you $500 Target gift card.et gift card. I love Target. This was a great deal. I bought it for a friend and she never had a chance to return it back. And she was so impressed.

All of my friends and family have come back on me and are so much more upset at it. They are so angry at all of this.

I did not do it for love of my own. I did it to share my money with friends and my family that have been like family to me. I love Target, I love this store.

My gift card was all I need to spend an hour or so back in my home town. Thank you!!<|endoftext|>
