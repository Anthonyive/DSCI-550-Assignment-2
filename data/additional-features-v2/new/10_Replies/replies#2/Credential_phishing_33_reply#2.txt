Your tax return needs to include your name, address and contact information. Please contact us at 1-800-874-3022 for a copy. Also be aware that Canada's corporate income taxes do not reflect the incomes that we make in Canada or receive in other countries.
You must also submit a return for the purpose of tax audits within 72 months after the end of the first year of tax year.
When the audit is complete and our report is filed and reviewed by our auditors, the results of the audits will be shown to the members of parliament, tax consultants, lawyers, and members of the public. We will release tax reports to these and many other important sources (including the Parliamentary Budget Board) and to our customers in a public accessible way.
If you have questions about your tax returns, please call or email your Auditor General at
