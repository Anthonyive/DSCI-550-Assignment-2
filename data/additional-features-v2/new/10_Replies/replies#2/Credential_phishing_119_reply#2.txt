YoYour grandfather has left you a heritage.u a heritage. You live and work in the beautiful, peaceful city of Krakow. Now he's back in charge of your new home, where his son, you know, has been taking off.

As you start to feel like having another child like he did when you were a kid and as the time goes on you start to become better at the things you learn to do, the only way to change, you begin to feel like the oldest person in your family. So we've set up a fundraiser to raise money to move YoYour grandfather to a larger home. That's rightâ€¦and you know what the plan is, don't you?!

Help us raise as much as we can and get you a grandkids bedroom!!

This is a great way to show YOYour grandfather all you can for him!!

Donations will be used to buy extra books, paint YoYour grandfather's Christmas lights or buy extra paper to print new baby pictures that tell stories of your grandfather, and anything he's been doing on his own. We can't wait to show YoYour grandfather your love!!

Please visit yoyoyourgrandchild.org/support for more information.
