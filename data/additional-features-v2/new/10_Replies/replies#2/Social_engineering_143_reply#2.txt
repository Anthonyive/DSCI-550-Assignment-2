Dear, I can give you $500 Target gift card. won't do anything good. It won't give you the
luck or the heart or the strength to beat someone,
or put you at risk for some big failure. It won't give you that hope. It won't let you realize that this game is,
well, a game.
It won't help you. It won't give you that money. It won't give you that game.
You don't have any other options. You don't have to go and get a game for the money. This game
is your choice. The game.<|endoftext|>
