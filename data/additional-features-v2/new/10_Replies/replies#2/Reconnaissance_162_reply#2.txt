Hi, I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's.  Since we are the only ones left of you to watch the live feed on the radio this has been my way of answering.  If you have not seen my Youtube videos in quite some time, it will show that you are a man of the people.  You will see in my videos where I cover all things US history as well as all the issues regarding World War II in America.  You will also see my articles on all the problems with US government spending and what the "problems" are.  To this day I am still amazed and very amazed that I find something I want to hear, anything from a live broadcast, which is a big deal.  As long as I am doing it right, you can be 100% assured that if you want to hear something from me, you can trust me.  You are the one and only one. And I think you are such a good speaker and a good man, I am glad for the support in our community.  But if you are so inclined, please help by contributing by clicking here. Thank you.  Also, by all means, don't hesitate to rate me and say if you liked that, and if you like the show.<|endoftext|>
