Please let us know by leaving a comment and I'll help if you have any special questions.You can ask questions in the contact form as well, and I'll get there ASAP.I am also glad to show you how to send money to charities in Greece to aid the homeless, as this will help you with any other charity issues you can imagine. In particular you should keep in mind that donations will need to be made directly from your email address as the money to this charity will only be being donated once. The deadline for a charitable solicitation is April 2nd, 2018, at 5:00 AM Eastern Time.For the full list of recipients of this money, click on the link below.The donation page is currently open 24/7. Please wait for it to become full.Thank you, and have a good week.I really appreciate your help on this, as it means a lot to me to help other people get better, so much so I know that most of you are out there.This is just for an informational donation to help those who are in need. All you need is a car or some clothes to have a spare bit of fun in the desert. You can help on the social media pages as well if you can afford to (i) set up or if the money is all you have left for that charity (ii) get help with our campaign to get our team members and volunteers trained so that we can find other ways to help.So help spread the word, donate, find food, help keep hungry people in shelter, and put some energy back into your home!<|endoftext|>
