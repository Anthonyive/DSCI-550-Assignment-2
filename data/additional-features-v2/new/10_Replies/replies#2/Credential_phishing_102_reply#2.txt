Hello, I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's.  I am a guy who works at my father's day care with my dad.  Sometimes we will start getting into games with him or his wife. I love playing chess with my dad and our kids.
And you know what?  It is really good.  So much more fun that it would be like eating your dad's lunch for breakfast.  It might give you a tiny smile if your dad is there.  We like the fun.  Our kids love the challenge.  Our dad plays against us at school so, why not?  He has his own day care group as well.  It is fun to go out and play on his day care and try to see the fun before the competition, knowing he'll be there to welcome you to his daughter.  It is really, really fun to play in our day care. But to be honest, I don't like playing chess for competition or playing games.  I don't think it is fun.  I think that it is not that entertaining, but I try not to think of chess as fun.  I love to have fun, but when I play chess, it is like playing a chess game.  I like to win, but I think it needs practice or focus.  I think you need to prepare.  
So to sum it up, I like playing, but my dad sometimes just gives me a little smile.  If my dad gives me a little smile.  It's good.  I think I like playing chess more.
Of course I've been looking for a new daycare group, so maybe my stepmother may try one or both. I'll see what happens.
I didn't find a daycare group there yet.  I just found this.  What else are they?  What do you think? Please tell me in the comments below, I love hearing from you.
