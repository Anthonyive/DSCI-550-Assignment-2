Hey,Urgency Alert, please reply within 3 days meet with your Secretary of State to meet with her.

During this conversation, she asked if I had any information concerning the events surrounding the attacks. During this time, I did not get a chance to read my letters.

As soon as the Secretary of State arrived home from a meeting with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a member of the Democratic Convention, we began to get an opportunity to discuss the issues at hand.

During these meetings, we spoke about the issues that affect our country. I am sorry to say I never learned the full truths of my involvement in the violence. But I will admit that I have not read your letters.

I am aware of what these people have said, and I would be so proud of you if they would have told me the truth and provided the truth. I would be so proud of you for your support of my cause.

When I read your letter, I am also aware that I have been through a lot with a lot of pain and suffering. I know where my wounds have been, who I have met, and what I can do to ensure those I have come to know is that I may be able to assist you in whatever way I can.

Now as Mr. Secretary
