Dear, I can give you $500 Target gift card.
I also cannot be held responsible for any of this information being out there.

If I am not being forthcoming with questions about my position regarding this, then that's not something I should be giving to anybody.

What about what would you think it could be to the point where someone who is aware of what is going on can request that my money be transferred to somebody else instead of myself?

This is not something that I can be expected to do, even if someone is willing to do this on their own.

I would like you all to understand that I'm not trying to throw anybody under the bus either.

I am very focused on getting the most out of my experience with managing a company.

It's important to let me know what you think about this. I will keep trying to stay on top of it.

I hope that you understand what I'm saying, and I would like you to understand the reasons behind it.

And I hope you all feel comfortable sharing their opinions.

You guys can all get behind me, and if you feel like we need to get this through and help you out, then just tell me.

Do I really need you to do this?
