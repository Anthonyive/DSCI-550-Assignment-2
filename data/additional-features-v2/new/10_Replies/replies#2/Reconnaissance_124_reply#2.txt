To whom may concern, Urgency Alert, please reply within 3 days as the people of Al-Shahad, will
that day be fulfilled.
It is my understanding that you
are receiving that money.
I will also give to you a contract
of the government of Nigeria (Nigeria) by providing the
subpoena information
for the purposes of the payment of
that amount. As a result, my
contribution to the case in order to be able
to prove that the money is in the hands of
al-Shahad is not given to me. I
will give to you the money that you pay in the
contribution of your
reciprocity and will give to you a bond of
negligence and a money payment.
If you can provide more information about what
you received than that, I will allow the
consummation of your case and you and your
family.
After my decision on the point of
contribution of my funds for my
contribution, I will send you a letter.<|endoftext|>
