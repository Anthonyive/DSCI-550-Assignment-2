Hello, I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's.  Since you both lived in London back in the day, I will admit that I am an old friends old friend of the old friends that you grew up watching together.  Because it has been more than 10 years since you moved here with your mother.  And yes, a little about us as brothers.  The two of us are cousins now, but our lives have changed because we shared many different stories about our parents.  We have developed a lot of friends over the years, and with your father, my parents have changed.  We have become quite good friends and very close as family, and we have become friends very successfully.  My father also grew up on the same property as you are, and in a very similar and exciting way to your mother, and because of this, my mother made me an extra in my early childhood years.
Thank you for allowing me to stay in this home for so long.
I am sure you were worried about the fact that we would leave without a home, or that you would be working in the UK because that was a possibility. I am sure you were just getting your life together, and your brother, and that you would be back in his house all of the time. As I told you, my relationship with your father (or mother, or other family) has changed so much since my little brother was born (and the couple is still the same age, only less than five years old). That means I have grown up as close as possible to you, and as your older brother has and still has.  I even feel like you are your own little brother, and I am so proud of
