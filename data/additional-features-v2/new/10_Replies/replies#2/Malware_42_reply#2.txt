Dear, I can give you $500 Target gift card. His statement here. His statements here also have been made at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.
Dr. Clinton has been an outstanding campaigner for our country. She has won eight states (including Nevada, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Wyoming) in our country's elections. Her greatest accomplishment as Secretary of State was that she became the first elected female President of the United States, and has also served as a leader in rebuilding the nation from the depths of depression and economic depression in its 30-year history. And her leadership in bringing about the economic recovery across the country is something she is proud of. So she understands the importance of working with business, particularly with the middle class, and she is an advocate for middle-class jobs and I agree that this needs to be done. And I'm confident that she will be able to do it with the hard work she puts in.<|endoftext|>
