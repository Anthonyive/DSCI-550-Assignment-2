Dear Sangeet Kishore,

I am having a rare illness. I have suffered a severe illness and am on ventilator for three weeks now.

The following day, i get up and go to sleep. I think of a bad dream, and i don't know what. I also think of the horrible feeling, and when I finish, i see something I was not meant for. At this time, i decided to do something and go over to the phone, and am asked what I could help.

I am very frightened when i come home, and am unable to feel the pain of my head. When i start reading, my brain does not feel pain. In other words, my brain is doing nothing wrong, and does not experience pain. This is a good thing, since it makes me happy.

At this time, I felt that i did not have to worry about my symptoms anymore.
