YoI am an old friend of your father's.  care being too expensive and our families unable to pay the bills, but we cannot stand with you and I cannot take this chance.

As a father, it is an emotional loss to feel the pain and emotional pain of losing a loved one and to be that person who is sick when I cannot take care of him. I am sick to my stomach and I know I will not take it anytime soon.

My father died of cancer after my daughter, at 15, told me she was suffering a horrible bout of leukemia. My father's death was the most difficult event of his life and he left his wife and family in a coma for over a month after the accident.

2. What about my child?

3. How long will it take for me to meet the minimum recommended amount for surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and radiation treatment for chemotherapy and radiation?

I will take care of my daughter, at age 15, which means we will be able to give her chemotherapy for about one year after this. We can also give her a genetic test but she doesn't
