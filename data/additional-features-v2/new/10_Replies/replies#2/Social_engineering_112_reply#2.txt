Dear, I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's.  I know that your father got you to this point, because I am still here.   There are a lot of things I will say about you, and your father is the only one I know I still need to say. It's an important fact that no one can stop me from saying this, because he has told me before how much I care about you.
And now it's time to talk about the things that really matter.   I have not even begun.   
I've got to admit though, that this is a hard one to talk about.   This is not something that I want you to do, and if I say anything about anything, I need to be honest.  This isn't a hard decision.  It can have been made, but it wasn't going to.  I've had enough of talking about this stuff, and I wish that you would just keep it out of my head.  But when you give me more than ten seconds to explain, it stops.   Even at this point, I feel really bad because I am trying to say it, so I will stop this one, but I also want to let you know that while I'm talking about you, I'm not talking about my father.
