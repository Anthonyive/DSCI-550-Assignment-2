YoYour father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. He said I was too small. I told him I was a child, I am a girl. So much so I cried. One day I was in the middle of a room, my mom and I were in my own room where my dad was asleep, and the bedroom had just been made into a nice looking room.


My dad was asleep. He cried, I couldn't believe it. I thought about what could possibly be wrong. We'd been out of our own home for a year and a half and was worried how that would happen.


But it wasn't to be.


For the next month, in May of 2011, I went back to my house. My mom and I had just gotten a new place to hang out. It was packed, so it was really nice to be back. All our belongings were covered, and we all had their belongings together.


My mom and I went upstairs into the living room. Inside, I saw my dad on his way down the stairs. I pulled him over, and my mom pulled him in, and she got him back in the living room. Then, the lights dimmed and I saw my dad there. I started to walk down the stairs, and my mom and I went to bed, and my dad lay there, he looked up at me and looked so sad.


He looked so sad. My mom walked up to him to lay his hands on his arm, and he looked so sad. My dad reached out and grabbed his waistband and laid it down on his back.


He didn't move. He just stood there, watching me go through my belongings, as if I was some kind of monster.


I felt my arms move, and the tears drop off my cheeks. My hair started to fall back to my shoulders. My eyes were watering
