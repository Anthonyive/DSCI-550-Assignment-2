Dear, Your grandfather has left you a heritage.u a heritage.

He was a farmer in the 1500's that had gone over all the land with two brothers. In the course of that time, they came to the same land. One of them was a man named Kater.

I was just going to write about this because if this is a story about the descendants of the Kater brothers who were still scattered in poverty in the Cabeza, where there are about 3,000 men, there
