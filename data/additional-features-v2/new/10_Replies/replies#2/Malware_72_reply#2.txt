Dear, I am an old friend of your father's.  plan and your life will be better. I am very sorry that I didn't get some of these emails today. I know I will have a real hard time getting through this period, and I know that this is not going to be the only way. However it is a wonderful, wonderful thing to take in the moment for yourself to try and understand this situation. These funds, however, are NOT just for the purpose of my needs. I will be donating most of these funds into charities, and I will provide for many of them in a way that does not need any special assistance. I need you to take responsibility for your own contributions to this blog. This is not my personal, and I do not own the blog. I am truly sorry. That is why I am making this statement today. It is my sincere hope that in some way we will achieve that goal. Thank you for taking this time and time again to be your ally, and thank you so much for supporting my efforts. In fact you may also be interested in my blog on my personal blog, where I put together a page dedicated to this blog and all of my resources including other resources I use everyday, as well as an article that will help me to make the most of this moment. I hope
