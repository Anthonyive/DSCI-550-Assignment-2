Hello, Your grandfather has left you a heritage.u a heritage. If you know how he has passed on his legacy, please remember the importance of your grandfather's legacy to you.

You are currently in college and I'm looking for a way to get your degree. It has been a long, hard fight, and you've always felt that you're better off having this chance than having no chance at all. I also want you to feel secure in your future as well. I want you to feel like you're part of your family and know there will be other people who would be better off doing the same.

I'd love to see you at the table that night with one of my friends. Thank you and God bless.<|endoftext|>
