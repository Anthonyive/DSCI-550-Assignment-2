Hello, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago. West Indies. The Frenchman spent nine weeks with a hamstring injury in November 2014 after a red card of that game. He became the first player since David Moyes at West Ham United to play for the team without an injury for the first time in his life. He then went to play for West Ham United, where he went on loan for three months.
West Ham have now released a statement on West Brom's situation saying that they will remain available and they will take over "operationally and in our club's best interests".
The move to leave West Ham could help the Premier League champions qualify for the Champions League next season. They could then try and sign a new striker as a possible option that could come before the end of the season.
