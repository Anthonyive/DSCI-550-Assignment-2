Hello, This is Donald Trump, I am RICH. I can give you 100,000,000 dollars.  is no longer looking to get a job as a parent, I must resign and she has no family support. I've called my lawyer and we are looking for help, but my mom is very tired of me.
I sent you the following (the BID's letter and a email from my assistant):
It's a bad feeling to me to see your daughter go through this. She has been very neglected but, unfortunately, my stepdad did something right. This is unacceptable. And, I'm not going to let this happen to a family that my son is now being sold into slavery. I know I have nothing to offer you. I know you are too old to go on this. But please don't put your finger on what's wrong. Tell the truth to me. Help her find her true love and take care of her. I've known yours for the past 5 years but this is what I thought was wrong and I don't want to see you go through another horrible nightmare.
Please take the time to contact your lawyer. In the mean time, I'm sorry and I would like to give you a letter from my attorney. We can continue your conversation but I have to ask my kids to leave ASAP. This is so bad and this is
