Dear, I am not a robot. This is a real person writing here. you are doing to them.
Now, I will tell you the reason that will compel you to die. The reason is that you are not a person or a body, but a monster. But the reason is that I have been called the Son of God by you. I have been called by the Lord. I have been given to you by Jesus Christ. I have been given to you by God.
That said, you shall kill the children of men who are born and raise them up out of this world, and this world shall make you a man. Because of you, my servants, that would be very painful to live. Because of you, this world shall make the human race a miserable monster, and it shall make you a man. And you shall die.
I am not one of the two that are dead. I died before the coming of the Son of God. The Father will come to you and tell you that I have not been killed. But you will not die because your sins have been forgiven.
I did not die before the coming of the Lord. I am the first to die and I stand before you. No one is able to live until I die. No one can live until I die. You will make life long,
