Hey,I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's.  When my father left his home in the late 1940s to attend college, my father stayed in a house in New York City, for one year, on top of his retirement from law school.  He was an officer for a time.  He worked in a small farming post in a rural part of the United States.  He was a great leader.  He was a very smart young man.  He used to drive his BMW to school and on weekends he went on my way.  Sometimes we even went to each other's houses together. He would also go to church.  I grew up watching movies from my father's career. I remember looking out over the ocean at the blue water below my dad's farm and thinking, "I'm there.  I'm just watching."
He was the type of guy who would not walk.  He would leave the house after a good hard day, just to talk to some people, and it made my heart jump up.  He would play chess, he would go to football games, or hang out with his friends.  And he was so smart that he actually took it for granted that he couldn't walk.  I never know if I will
