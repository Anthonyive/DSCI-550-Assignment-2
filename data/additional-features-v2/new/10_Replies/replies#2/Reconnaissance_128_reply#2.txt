Hi, Please provide me your bank account number and the 3 digits on the back. on the back.  In a situation like this, a bank is no longer entitled to your account number and there is no way for you to transfer your funds.
This is a recurring situation. This would involve you depositing your money at a different bank when it was deposited.  You may need to wait a few weeks before checking the account number.
You should then check your bank accounts and be clear of any cash.
Keep in mind this would happen if you moved from one account to another and asked to transfer funds in that particular account.  You may not be able to retrieve a receipt from your bank and still have cash in your account.
You may not be able to see a receipt from your bank for more than three months at the end of your life.
In this situation, I would consider using other ways to transfer money to the bank.
I would look for ways to contact your bank that have more than 3 months of account.  If you are able to, I would recommend using the following: 1) the 3rd party online banking system 2) free credit card services 3) a debit card or bank transfer on behalf of the account holder
If you feel you would like a financial assistance account (fafs) that is required for transferring funds to the bank, consider contacting this or other online financial aid company.
I am aware this is frustrating, but I would like to clarify.  I have tried many times to find a good solution that would take your money to my bank without the hassle.  But this was not possible.  If you have any questions, please contact me.
