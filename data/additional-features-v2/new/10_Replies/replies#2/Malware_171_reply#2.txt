Hi, Your grandfather has left you a heritage.'s note. The Fed did not say what rate of rate increases would be for the notes under future rules, and officials have not made any definitive announcements about when the $20 trillion notes will be issued.

The release also noted that the Fed's own data suggests the Federal Open Market Committee has the first estimates of the level of debt in the country.

In 2011, when the $20 trillion dollars were announced, the U.S. debt stood at $16.8 trillion, the equivalent of about 0.19 percent of total government debt. That was down slightly from the previous year, when the $20 trillion was announced, at $16.5 trillion.

At the end of May, the Federal Open Market Committee reported it issued a series of new notes that will be the first to be published under the Fed's monetary policy website.
