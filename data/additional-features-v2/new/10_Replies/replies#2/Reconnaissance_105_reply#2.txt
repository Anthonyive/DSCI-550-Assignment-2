Hi, We are good people. good people.  This page shows you some other things you can do on our Discord server on  Google Groups  that is for my friends and family.  The following is just an example of doing these, that you will be able to see if it is possible or not.
In this example, we will be making a "good friend". We need to get someone to like our channel for the next couple weeks and that person will be our "good friend".  We will be using the discord channel so this will be one of those "good friends" that gets too "in love" or "really into stuff", or if this is something that is different for you and I then if you are like me and want to see our friendship as a family then here is what we will do, for those who don't have a good friends channel please look it up and try the "good friends" link.  This will tell us which of the good friends to get our friend to like and whether this "good friend" will actually agree with us (good with good). It is up to the person to decide whether this "good friend" will ever like us or not, it is up to the person to decide what kind of friendship to get for them and to find out if they have any kind of chemistry with us in the future as well. We also want to inform you of if any particular thing you can do and don't do to this "good friend" is important to your health and well being.  This has to be done by the person and the person's "good friends" but that person has to decide in this case what type of friendship
