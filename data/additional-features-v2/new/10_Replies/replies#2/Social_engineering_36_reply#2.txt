YoI am an old friend of your father's. , this is not the case. The trust is owned by the people of my hometown of Kremen, and is now known as Kremen Trust. At a certain stage, many people were looking to make a move to Europe. Most of them were not prepared for the consequences, nor were they prepared for this world-class charity.
One of my clients on the Kremen trust (a non-profit trust which provides financial support to people who are seriously injured in accidents) has been brought to Europe, and has been treated here for over four years. On the day that he became ill, he returned home. On October 6th, my father was admitted to the hospital, with a broken leg, having to live for the rest of his life without painkillers. It was only a few days later that the body was found. He had been killed in the streets of Kremen. The fact that he was able to continue working for so long, despite many obstacles, was incredible to me, and I do wish my father's spirit was restored to him, and if I could give him a new life, I would, too.
The funds raised through this support have been used to fund my new project - the kimberlite foundation,
