Dear, I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's.  I like you very much, as a former professional wrestler, but I never thought you would make it into WWE.  I am a long-time friend of yours, and you are very much my brother.  I will never let you down, since I have learned about you, your talents, and your power.<|endoftext|>
