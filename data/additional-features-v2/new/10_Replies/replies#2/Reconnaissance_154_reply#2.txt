Dear, Your grandfather has left you a heritage.u a heritage. This gift is as wonderful as you and your wife, and as rare and precious as any precious item. It's been here for you since you were a young child.

It's been here since you were a young child – until we shared this beautiful little life with you through a lifetime of being family – because we all were made to feel so special for so long.

This gift is now in our memories. It will be here forever, and it will be beautiful to see it in that spirit, because that's why it was in so very special circumstances, and in our hearts and minds the whole time we lived together – because we spent that entire childhood and in that time of love and love, just so we could share, and share in the experience of each other, with each other – this gift of yours will forever be with us, it will forever be with you, just so we can take in our shared story and share the same love to you, and because we love each other so much, we are so very fortunate to have this gift of yours today.

I have a dream about the day your mother will have the chance to see it in person, by our daughter and we are so very lucky, because every family has their own dreams of a day of this gift.

My dream is, when my mother and I share the time together in her home, the memories we have, and the memories we have of each other, my mother and I share, to not only share the love of my mother with our daughter and her family, but we share the love, the joy, the kindness, the happiness, of the family and her children, that she truly knows about in front of her eyes.

I cannot imagine how much we will ever share. We will never forget, but we will never forget the love and the kindness, and the caring and the love that I have shared with all of you since we were younger, but the love, the friendship, and the smiles of everyone on the family, all the people that you have made. I hope the day you remember how much we shared
