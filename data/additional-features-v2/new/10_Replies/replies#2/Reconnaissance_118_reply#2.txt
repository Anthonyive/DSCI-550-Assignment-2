Dear, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. Since then I have spent months with my uncle. I understand that this man (a retired army chief, well known to many other people in the police force) gave no warning to my brother that he and his men were under arrest. And to this day I am still unable to make out which man is telling the truth and who the real culprit is. Therefore all of you must give me a lot of information.

Dear, You were very lucky. I was at school at the time. My friend Sushil, the only one of my friends who I knew was a policeman who had told me to leave my school and went with my family, told me that my brother had come for the military training. He never made any threats for me, so I didn't talk to him. After my brother told me that the army had arrested Sushil he got mad and started shooting at my relatives, but they managed to stop him before he had any time to come home. My son and all my friends were murdered so they could escape. But then I lost my job and my friend Sushil told me that he and the soldier from the military was in a meeting with Sushil.

I also want to make clear to all of you that I am a soldier. Because this happened to my sister-in-law, I have a lot of problems with the army. This is my fault. I have lost my life fighting for the army and to this day I can't find anybody who can get to me if my military superiors don't give me the documents.

Please provide me with proof that we are not terrorists. We are our brothers.

Dear,

I am a veteran, a former police chief of the Indian Police Corps. My uncle Sushil is the only person to have any knowledge on these things.

My brother Sushil is accused of committing one of the attacks on the Indian Police in 1993, but I did not have any idea.

At the time, I did have no idea what was going on with the army. I thought that my brother was arrested to prevent the army from targeting my family. I thought that if Sushil was to tell me the whole truth, he
