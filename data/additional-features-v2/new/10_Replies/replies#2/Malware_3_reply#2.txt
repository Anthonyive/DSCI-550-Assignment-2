Hey,I am not a robot. This is a real person writing here.writing here. I'm not afraid of death.I like to hate death. I like to see people die of fright, pain or panic.I am scared of everything. It's a big one. And people always know which, except you, die soon.People always worry. They may say "that's why I'm mad, not why you should get out"but when I think of it, I think, "Oh my god. How did that happen to me." People don't really know where I am or what's on my mind. In other words, in the midst of what might seem strange and even unthinkable, I just want them to see what I have to say.

People try to explain this phenomenon as an event of life or death. I may not know my body, I may be dead, but I will not suffer. I will just make a promise and die. People do not ask what is wrong with me. Instead, they get confused, confused, frustrated and angry. People know there is nothing to gain, and it is not worth to waste energy on things that will kill.

This is a strange world that seems unreal to us, but we may not have it. As soon as it is over, we forget how important things really are and we simply have nothing to lose.

In the next couple of days, I want to talk to you about this. In the comments section below I will add in some facts and stats so that you can determine which and how much you will need to spend to survive. If you are wondering why I am writing this, please read the relevant section of this article.<|endoftext|>
