Dear, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.. I think we were willing to go to great lengths to see this go through. This was an opportunity for him to step back in to try to be the President in both a good way.
On April 21st, at 5:15, Ambassador Stevens' SUV was hit by a U.S. Special Operations fighter jet that was responding to the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. The attack was the deadliest in American history. The following day, Secretary of State Clinton and First Lady Michelle Obama began a four-day conference call to coordinate their efforts to find a way to bring about a political settlement of this crisis. The Secretary has called for a temporary halt to operations until a new security plan can be reached, a halt to the destruction of information from the attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi and an end to all communications that had taken place between two of our diplomatic missions.
We are now at the stage where the administration believes it has the best chance of dealing with a humanitarian crisis in this country and we are trying to do that. It is going to be very difficult for our administration because of some of the things we can do about this.
