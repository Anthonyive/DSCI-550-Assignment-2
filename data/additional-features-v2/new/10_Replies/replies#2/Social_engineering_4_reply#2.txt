YoWe are good people.  is their own people's right to exist. It is their people's right to have their government set up to defend them. The people are there to take down injustice.

And these people are calling it a moral hazard. It's a moral hazard we have to take on.

It's an atrocity because in South Africa the moral hazard is as high as it gets. I think it is as high as a lynching in the country because as often as I see black boys going out there killing whites, I think in order to be killed, blacks have to be shot.

And in South Africa we have lynched five African men, the rest are free. Some of the whites who were there have been released from jail because of this injustice.

People have come into my office asking me how I can provide them with money for justice for this injustice.

I am not a politician; I'm not a politician. I am a Law Reviewer in South Africa. I am the only law reviewer there for years.

If one of my partners - and I will tell you what, he is a law student, and I'm not a law student because he is a law student - he is a friend of mine.
