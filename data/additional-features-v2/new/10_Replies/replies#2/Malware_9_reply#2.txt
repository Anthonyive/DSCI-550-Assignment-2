Dear, This is Donald Trump, I am RICH. I can give you 100,000,000 dollars. 000 dollars.  I will pay your debts that day, and I will have you pay them all in installments of $2,000.00.  It's so hard to live with such money. I have no life, and this is my burden... I have a great debt and I can pay it.  I have to keep this money. I have to pay every other little one for your misery.  When your taxes are low (you just don't like paying them), I am so proud of you.  Now, if you live a life of a happy, rich life, I'll help you pay it. You can't afford that.  I have no future, you've got no idea what it's like to have one, I will do it. Don't think I'm not going to help you out here.  I know the situation is bad.  I've done it before, and I'm not even the worst in it.  I know that when you pay me, I will take care of you, and as long as I take care of you, I will not allow you to leave me alone. I hope that every single American realizes that. So thank you for the support you've given me and my wife, our family, my son and dear son for their success. Please know that I appreciate you getting to spend your whole life working for an American citizen.<|endoftext|>
