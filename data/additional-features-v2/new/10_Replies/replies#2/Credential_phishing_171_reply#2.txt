YoYour grandfather has left you a heritage.u a heritage. But, how does one become an American? That's exactly what an American of Indian descent who immigrated with his parents to the United States (his ancestors migrated to California when they first became Indians) does in the case of his grandmother, who is a member of the Southern California NAACP.

While his ancestors did take out a loan, so far, he has chosen to put the money back into his family's business, in a joint venture with a new development company, a company called YoYour Grandma.

According to San Francisco Chronicle.com, the deal was in part a collaboration between the family and Los Angeles-based developer YMC Entertainment. According to the story, the couple's goal has been to raise $500,000 to buy out local businesses.

In a joint statement, YoYour Grandma's attorney, David DeLaurent, and a representative with YMC Entertainment stated, "We're thankful to the family for a well-deserved legacy. It's been a long process and we will continue to support each other on our journey. In addition, our team is in the process of reaching out to various stakeholders to further the development of the YoYour Grandma character. That means we are currently in the process of evaluating both the development project and how it will be brought into fruition. We will provide any additional information as to who we may ultimately be pursuing for this project."

The agreement is in the early stages. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the family has received no interest from the development company, which is comprised primarily of investors, real estate salespeople and a family lawyer, according to Yahoo Finance.

"I understand we are looking at some of the community's concerns, but we feel we are making the right choices in terms of development that will not put our future at risk," Laurent stated.
