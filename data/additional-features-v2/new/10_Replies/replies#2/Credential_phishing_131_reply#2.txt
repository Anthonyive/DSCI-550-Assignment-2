Hey,You have an unpaid debt. able to pay for it all because, of course, money went missing.
There has been no such thing as a final settlement because this is not a final agreement because it has been decided in the courts that the British will continue to pay the government.
If this is not settled in accordance with the terms of a final agreement then I must go.
Please note that I know that this is not for my own good. Please see this page.
Your best is, Sir.
MARY BOSWELL
Ms. BOSWELL of the United States is a law clerk for Senator Richard Burr.
I have been advised of your request.
Now please send this request to the President to secure your consent.
Mr. Speaker, I send you this message. As Secretary General of the United States Department of State you are obligated to answer my letter for an answer.
Thank you.
There you will see my letter dated January 7, 2001, which, I understand, you received last week.
I take full responsibility for your receipt of it. I would like to inform my colleague of the decision. I hope I did not miss a step by step. This is my concern and I would like to give you this notice.
