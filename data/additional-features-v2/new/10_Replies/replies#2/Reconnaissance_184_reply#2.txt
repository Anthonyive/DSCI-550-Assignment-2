Hi, I am not a robot. This is a real person writing here. So, I have no regrets and don't want anybody to be deceived. It is my privilege that we have the most talented, the brightest, the most innovative and in the end will see the way we are all going to benefit, without knowing what they have found. I have to tell you that you will always be amazed by my contribution to this world and you will not know what else to do with my face, my money, my life, my body, my education, my memory. I hope that you will also see how my memory is now very strong and that others do too. And I will tell you that I think this world is going to be different. I am still thinking about the future as a member of this great African nation that was once, I hope, only about a decade old when the World Cup was played in the 1970s. I hope that the world will change so that everybody has the opportunity to come together and create a better society by all means, not just politicians but people of all religions and traditions and also their youth groups. I think that the world of this country can be changed. If the world has not been created and we live in a society where all people of good will, all groups of people, all races, all cultures
