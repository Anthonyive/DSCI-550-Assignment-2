Hello, I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's.  Our house is a little more than half a mile from the border and in a very good condition, we have everything we need.  The kids had fun playing on a tree.  I had a great time playing, making a lot of little pies, and getting my hair done at 8am every night.  It was an awesome time of our life.  We had fun getting to know each other.  We did this with all of us, but it's not a very nice life.  I think the children would have enjoyed it more if we had a chance to just play a little more.
Now, some time ago I got a note about a friend of yours.  Well, my dad is a professor who used to go in and work as a freelance writer.  The house he moved into was fairly well built and I remember talking to him a few times.  He told me that he lived on a very modest income.  When I told him that I was living on $5 an hour, I got an interesting response.  What do you make money at $5?  He said,  I don't really have the money for art work.  Well, I guess it depends on the story.  The thing is, when it comes to making money at work, this isn't necessarily what people think about.  I'm sure your dad is a painter, and some of you may be in the art field, but that doesn't mean we know where we work. And of course, you'll want to have an idea of what a typical person does in the art world.
I just wanted to show you all the ways
