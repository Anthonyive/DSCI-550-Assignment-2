Hello, We are good people. good people.  It took us longer than you expected but we are now just people trying to stay happy.  I got involved in the food industry here in Oregon and worked with other people to create one of my favorite food carts.
We started our first and will continue to expand the business into others from everywhere. We are very proud of what our customers have brought to our community and we're excited to have been featured in the first issue of " What's New in 2014?"
We have always tried to put together a great product for any market, so please bring your suggestions and ideas here. Thank you again.<|endoftext|>
