Hey,Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. I was a very loving mother. Every time you walk outside or try to tell me I have made you sick, I would think, "Do you want to talk to me like this again?"The truth is I grew up very poor. I don't know what the hell I'd have lived without a home. I'm pretty sure the kids were in school at one time or another. It was in the beginning but was stopped at about the time you were born, so it's just not good to go through that much trouble when you can go to school.I'm hoping you'll feel better right now. We never were nice to one another. And most of all, it's hard to stay happy when you grow up in such a shitty house.

I wanted a better life for her, but I wanted to make sure that I kept my promises to her every day.So I decided that I was going to take a chance. I got a job doing laundry.

Then I had a second chance and I went to the right place to be a good person and I lived good. I didn't want to let my kids down as I always expected a family to be able to love and care for one another.

I'm going to keep that goal high and I'm going to bring my own style of living and make sure my kids have a home. I think you're looking at this really cool piece of information. I've also been looking for a place to live since we moved here a few years ago. It's
