Hey,Urgency Alert, please reply within 3 days my story:

I will get to the point where I will pay for this thing when I sell a home for $250,000.00 USD or $1 million, and if you don't buy that property and I buy it for $250,000.00 USD or $1 million I will have all your help with it. I will help you take care of your children. I will help you take care of your mother. I will help you take care of the family. You have to figure out what money means. You know I've been able to give you the money I promised my father. And I know it won't just be you, but your business. It will be your business. You'll be safe, and you'll be happy to be around, because I can make it happen. I guarantee that that money will be there because I will have the money and I will have the assets. The only way I can take care of all the family is through my business. I have the stock in my family for this. I just bought a house. I just got a house. That's a mortgage. It cost me $250,000.00 USD. And I'm able to make that money a lot. My life changes every minute
