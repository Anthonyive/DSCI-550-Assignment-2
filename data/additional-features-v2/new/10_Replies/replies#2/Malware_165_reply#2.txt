Hi, Urgency Alert, please reply within 3 dayswithin 3 days of receipt of this product. I can't help you but think your voice is impaired. We must first send the product to all affected communities as a full refund, and it must be shipped to all customers within the next 24 hours (unless you are a "regular" retailer.

When I tried this product I was surprised at the ease of it. I have been using this for 3-4 weeks, and it seems to help with my ringing and ringing, no complaints. The product will send within 2-4 weeks, and if shipped out within 4 months (even longer if it's a "regular" store like Walmart or Target, where you don't have to pay for this product) i'd be completely happy to accept it.

This was my first time using this item as it took around 1 month before i found out i'd pay for it and also that it would come in the mail in about 4 weeks. The warranty will be renewed for a full refund when you are done with the shipping.<|endoftext|>
