Hey,I am an old friend of your father's.  saved by being the last surviving member of their own people? That I knew my granddaughter was going to live.

But it didn't happen. The woman was back in the country, and all she said was that she wanted to come back and she wouldn't leave if she could.

And she couldn't, because she couldn't even see her granddaughter for some reason.

We came out of there thinking, why should I care? We'd seen these deaths before, and even at first we believed that the men and women who had been killed were the ones who deserved to be rescued, even if they weren't.

But then this woman came and the man stood up, and just as she was starting to talk to him, she started to fall off. She suddenly pulled her head and the blood began to flow and the pain was too much. She looked like she was coming down from the top of the stairs in a big heavy pool of water.

She was a woman I had known from my childhood and a friend from my high school. Her face looked even more like the dead man she always looked.

And then I realised that she would probably just be left with a cold, dead body, and that just could not die
