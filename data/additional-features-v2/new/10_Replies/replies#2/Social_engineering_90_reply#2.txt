Dear, I am an old friend of your father's.  sure that you do what you can to ensure that they get the best benefit for you and for your family.
The fact that you have the ability to give your son an all-out job, and that you have the power to help him do that when it's right in his best interests as opposed to those of us who have the power to hold them responsible to a degree they never could have. You know, in the past, you have been able to give your son an all-out job, but the last thing I would do is be like a bunch of guys that did that. I could have done a lot better.
I believe in myself that you should take everything you want with you to fight for these freedoms, and that you are willing to fight for those freedoms for your family and friends.
I believe in all of you and I will work with you and your family, no matter how hard you try, to help you build up those freedoms and you will not give up. I believe in you and I hope that you will come out in the best way possible to help you, and you may not realize all of what that means until you get into a job.
My name is Nicky, and I am in charge of the Philippines National
