YoYour father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. He was such a gentleman to us. I've always lived in tears and he'd always give me encouragement. We still love him. He made me grow up a very big girl and gave me an opportunity for myself. He was a brother to me, a man of great dreams and I'm looking forward to having him back. If he's up to the challenge, I'll be back!

I'm an old friend of yoyo, as well as a mom to a large group of people, and I'm also a huge member of Aikido. I got out of college with the intention of getting a full medical degree. After looking at the history of that, I'm sure I was wrong. I've never heard about the Yoyo organization, but I did hear of them from my mom's family, but really I just liked what I found out about the Yoyo Club. So at least my mom wasn't a part of it at the time! I don't have a full medical degree right now, but I'm hoping to someday. I've never had any trouble with any of the club, but still can't give you a solid "no" without asking! I can't wait to try out a new training position as well!

As a parent, I want to make sure your kids get that great training as well. I know many of these boys have had the same problem as me at home with a group of high school-aged kids. This
