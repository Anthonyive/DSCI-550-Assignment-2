Hi, I can give you $500 Target gift card.et gift card. (You can get 50 other 50 gifts too)

What do you do with your $500 gift card? If I get lucky and that gift card gets used up, what kind of things do I put in it? It has to tell me which ones are used up so I can find a way to get them to return them to you. Just let me know if you've got any info about what you do with the gift.


If you haven't posted a comment yet, please share a picture or write them to me. I need your help in finding out who you are, what do you do with that $500 gift card, and for what kind of gift cards.

Thanks!
