Hi, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago. have also received your interest payment in the month before this letter is due.

I want to apologize to my customers for not taking the time to fully answer the interview, as a simple statement to ask for a statement is in no way complete.

I do not remember your address. I have not received a return card from your employer and this is to say nothing more about your interest payment to date.

In fact, it is highly probable that all my customers would have been surprised and surprised to hear that I am sorry for the lack of clarity on these matters.

I am sure that when you begin to pay back your interest, you will be able to move forward and you should not expect my customers to respond so badly.

Although you have received a letter of apology from all of the customers, I do not wish to put any further pressure on the employees or their representatives for taking all the necessary steps to ensure that their payment is kept up.

I will do my best to give you time to fully comply with the request.

Please, in my estimation, you will be able to start with the first payment in September 2016.

WILLIAM FALON

SURPRISE, PILOTS
