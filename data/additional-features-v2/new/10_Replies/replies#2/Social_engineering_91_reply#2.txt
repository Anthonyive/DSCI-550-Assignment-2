Hey,I am an old friend of your father's. ur father's. Â I live up the street from you on I-285 where you are standing with the car at our side to watch the latest drama. I'm a big fan of your dad's, both because of the cars and because of the stuff he plays with his kids (with some friends and family), and as a result, I know there are other dads that I will be seeing.<|endoftext|>
