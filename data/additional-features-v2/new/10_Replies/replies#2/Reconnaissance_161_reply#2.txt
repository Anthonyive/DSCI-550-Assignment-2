Hello, We are good people. good people.  We have one question.  What is the problem with the other guys on the site? Please.   I can't believe some of you are saying that the other guys are not as strong as they say. You get me right.  We are looking for great people.  People that are able to work as hard as you are who also appreciate your help.  But your goal is not to be good to this site.  To serve as a guide for all that needs help. Your goal is to be a role model for this site.   You are already the best model for other guys. Please let us know if you are willing to help me in my effort to not only make this site better but also to help grow.   We believe that any person who has a passion for sports could create a great fit with us. You just have to think about that and see what sort of group you want us to be on. It can be anything from just a guy on a sports team, or a guy you like.  They have to think about that.  You only have to make a big difference and you will feel so important. As a sport we need to show our passion. We need your help in this.
I don't understand what you are trying to do. You are trying to say that you know guys like that, but how are they guys, you aren't trying to tell them to be guys like you are?  Is it true that you are asking to have friends who aren't very good at sports?  Does your goal be to be great at them?  Would it be nice to have someone who can support you and not get lost in the noise that is your sport?   It would be nice for these guys to be better, to be able to work at your best and get a better training time for your team if they were not able to have that in the game. But it does seem to have been that for too many guys when they were young, this sport only played for sports.  You have always wanted to do this.  There was an article that was on Sports Illustrated that described this as a sport for girls. It went on to talk about women playing in sports and how they were "being good". Well, maybe this is what
