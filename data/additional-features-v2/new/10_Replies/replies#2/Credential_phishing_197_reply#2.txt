Dear, I am an old friend of your father's. 
our investigation we also discovered that the money did not
actually arrive to you for 10 years.
There is no legal action against any American bank, but we hope you
understand that we are not interested in any kind of legal
partnership, because this is the very heart of the matter
because if we do not get the money and we do not receive the
money and we do not receive the money then we will lose money
and we will be unable to obtain the money again.
Please, let me make it clear that any such
contact at all is totally against our government's interests. Thank you for your
care.
As always, I hope that this information will be of assistance to you in providing this information.
Thanks again for your understanding.
Bishop Thomas-Nancy -
Randy.
