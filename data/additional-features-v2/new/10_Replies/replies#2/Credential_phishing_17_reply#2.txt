Dear, I am an old friend of your father's.  States Senate that I passed an anti-terrorism resolution that brought the federal government to the defense of the Constitution and the Constitution itself, and this is what I've accomplished.

That resolution was drafted by my fellow Senators from all across this country, and while it will help us combat extremist elements, it will also provide us with an incentive for our Government to take on some of the more insidious forms of extremism that threaten our democracy.

So we must continue to work to bring justice to the most heinous elements, and then to continue working to bring accountability to the perpetrators of this crime that we have just identified.
