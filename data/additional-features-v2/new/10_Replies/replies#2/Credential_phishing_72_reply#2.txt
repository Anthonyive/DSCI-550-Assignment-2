Mr. Dubois often made small talk about Jewish affairs. He told a friend about two young girls who were the only Jewish children of Jews alive at that time. One said she was a girl "wandering the world who knows not anything of my religion or my place of worship."
The friend knew Mr. Dubois but never mentioned that the boy was Jewish.
It was not until he died that the friend knew he was Jewish.
According to his family's letter, Mr. Dubois had been "employed, supported, and supported over a year and a half, on a variety of projects and on a variety of small, low-cost projects, both in New York City and internationally." He lived in Harlem and then moved to Buffalo in the summer of 1917, working as a mechanic.
"At the age of twenty four, Mr. Dubois began to have difficulties in his job," reads the letter, which was prepared at the age of thirty-two. "He could no longer buy machinery and also could not sell his tools or machines."
In the late summer of 1917 he was arrested, tried, sentenced, and hanged in New York City. This was his last and only defense as he was hanged from a wire at Albany,
