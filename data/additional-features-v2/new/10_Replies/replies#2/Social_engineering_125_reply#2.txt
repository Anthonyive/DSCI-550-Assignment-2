Dear, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. I wish we lived with our own children. We cannot do that. But we can do that on behalf of the children of Moulins, a town in the southern border state of Moldova.

Moulins has a population of 8,000 people. The village is located on the river Luch, at the entrance to the village of Dorets, which is about 20 minutes away from Dorets, the nearest to Moldova. I am from the Tbilisi-speaking region and had been hoping to go somewhere more friendly to the south. There have been only about 10 visitors since Moulins was established in 1984. However, today, since there has been a new government for the whole region, I have found some new contacts who are familiar with Moldova.

Moulins has its own language and culture. It is a diverse people. There are several ethnic groups living in the town and several linguistic groups. Moldova also has a large number of ethnic traditions. Moldova's unique culture and religion is the traditional Ukrainian Ukrainian language. There are many dialects. Every Ukrainian language has its own customs and traditions. Some ethnic traditions are local and some are local. They differ from one another in their linguistic diversity, in a big way, because in the Ukrainian, some are called "mushibri", which translates to "noble children", whereas in the Malayalam it means "doting sisters".
