Dear, This is Donald Trump, I am RICH. I can give you 100,000,000 dollars.  Foreign Account Control Act, which allows governments to do business with foreign governments, and I believe that is exactly what this letter is about.
I did not, in fact, see Mr. Hameet or his lawyers at that time. Instead I have communicated to them through Facebook, which is a separate application from this letter. I may have to wait until they get to the truth about the man being held alive because I am not allowed by law to let them know.
I understand that most of you would prefer to stay quiet at this point, but we need your help. So please follow this link: www.sheriffs.gov/hq-investigations.<|endoftext|>
