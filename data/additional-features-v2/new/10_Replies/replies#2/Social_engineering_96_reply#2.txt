Dear, You have an unpaid debt. unpaid debt. I feel this can't be done

at work. The whole situation has started with you complaining about not being able to afford

your food. Your job requires you to put food on the table as well as work hard to stay in the kitchen.

I'm not able to make you any money. I need food and you need to bring money in for this. We need to work more hours to ensure you have enough food in the

work space. I want to see this resolved. I've sent in a $7 donation.

The money was requested. If I don't do this, you'll be sending me a full refund. I am very angry.

You are clearly annoyed and we all should be very angry. However, I would like to hear your opinion so we can go to court to get this removed from you.

I don't have a car and have an appointment. However, since you haven't paid me yet, you will have to ask how much the deposit will be, the amount that will be required for your car rental payment and all the fees that this will take. I don't have any bank account yet and need money so I have to ask for it ASAP. You seem really mad at me. Please consider sending me your best and I'll talk to you a bit about how it will work out. (and if you can't talk to me, can you please let me know anyway)

Thank you,


I appreciate your time,


Tom<|endoftext|>
