Dear, I am an old friend of your father's. Michael,
Your response is great, I'm sure it can help a lot.
But the biggest problem is that as we look through the websites and email lists we have received on various pages related to this project, this email has all been found for people who don't have that contact information. It's really bad. I think I might as well find a website that will provide the information for all the people who will send us what information.
I just want to ask you that you take this project seriously. I hope it will help you and that your friends and neighbors find the information they need to stop being afraid of any non-white people going to meet up with white people.
