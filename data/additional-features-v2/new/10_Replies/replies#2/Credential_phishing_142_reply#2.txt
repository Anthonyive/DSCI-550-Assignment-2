To whom may concern, We are good people.  the House of Representative, and the Leader of the Committee of an Independent Committee of a Banking and Finance Committee. During my four-decade service, I have helped create several initiatives that have, so far, been limited in scope to the role that I can play.
I did not engage in political activity with my colleagues but rather at the behest of my colleagues. If I had been elected President, it would have been impossible for my colleagues to change my appointment.
When I left the Committee in February of 1999 I resigned immediately in protest at a decision by the Treasury Department to stop the issuance of the Federal Reserve Notes (the Federal Notes that are convertible into Treasury securities) because they were being issued to a new holder. The Treasury Department later acknowledged that the Government wanted to issue the Federal Notes.
I did not intend to influence the decision of the Treasury Department by accepting new payments from a new holder of a Treasury note, nor was there anything I did in the slightest to interfere with their purchasing decisions. I was elected on June 24, 2002 and am now Chairman.
The Chairman of the Committee of an Independent Committee of a Banking and Finance Committee had the honor of taking the first oath in the Federal Reserve Council on March 3, 2002. I am elected as President
