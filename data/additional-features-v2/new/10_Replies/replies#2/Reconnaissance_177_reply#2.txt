Hey,Your grandfather has left you a heritage.u a heritage.
You've got a big ol' grudge.
Maybe you even want him dead, but the odds are a long way, not a short one at that. (You never really know. There will always be some who will not see that, though.)
The grudge comes because of your parents' divorce.
The relationship started to hurt before the children came of age.
You think your Dad is the only thing doing it.
The grudge could be real.
Maybe you remember it as a couple, which is quite normal.
Your grandfather used to go to bed hungry sometimes and often didn't seem to see how you could help him.
If you were a parent, you didn't even bother helping your children.
And even if you did try, you'd never succeed.
So when you were five or six, you left your parents alone.
You kept telling yourself, 'Mom, I'll help you out, I'm just not right. We're going to fix it.'
But there's no way.
When my father is sick, he will always ask what's wrong with you, and he'll always tell you it's not you you're suffering from, you're a burden on this person.
And he won't tell you that.
You never want to admit it. You never want to admit the truth.
You will not let anyone tell you what's really wrong, because you're hurting everybody else. Your parents will always complain about you.
You'll always take things with a grain of salt. You'll probably be too embarrassed to admit it and, then, no one will listen to you.
When your father is dying and you don't want to take anything that's good for him
