Hello, You have a package in Fedex, please call us back! In this effort, I have learned many things I did not know. There are still many projects in Afghanistan which I have not been able to complete, and it is very difficult to tell what a large percentage of them have yet to be completed. At this point I do not want to take advantage of this opportunity to start over. I have to spend your time on these projects. I will get your money. I also want to have an opportunity for you to be an advisor and your father in charge of the military project.

I am grateful to you and your family for your commitment and sacrifice. In no way can I blame you but for now, we will never be able to reach this point. I know you would have loved to have had your daughter. I know you would have loved to have been able to see the future.

Thank you for taking the time to find out more about my life for this long period of time. Now, let's work to bring you and your family back together in peace.<|endoftext|>
