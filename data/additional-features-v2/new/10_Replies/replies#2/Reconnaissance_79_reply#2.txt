Hey,Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. She lived alone and never saw you or saw you again. Now she lives off of your money and her sister, a widow. I need an insurance company to buy insurance for you, to keep her going. But the doctor said that if you put the money into my son's life and he dies with my family, I will put the money into my son's future and you can live there until you die. So when I saw your pictures you took me back to your house! But I thought that, you know, I shouldn't worry about this and take care of my son's family. You and your mother have everything back.


You have an older brother and an older sister. I can't ask for this, but you need me for my daughter! If I leave the country I will become your little sister!
