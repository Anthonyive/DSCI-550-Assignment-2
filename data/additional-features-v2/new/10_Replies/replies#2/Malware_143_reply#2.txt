Dear, Your grandfather has left you a heritage.u a heritage. He lives in the same community as you, and this is what it means to have him.

Your grandmother died at the age of 90 after being too sick to have children. Her only surviving children are a daughter and a niece.

You want to move on to your child's future. Your life would be a lot better if you were able to continue living. But there is a price for doing so.

Your grandparents and you both have made life miserable. Your parents divorced, and your grandparents' parents went to prison for not sending enough cash to the orphanage. Your grandfather lived under a false name, and you and your grandfather went to prison. What's not to love?

Why did your grandmother's name die with her name stuck in this history book? Her family believed that the only way to move on to your future was through a better life.

The law protects your mother in certain ways (see the legal section at the bottom of this website).

She was raised in the same community, and she has never been in jail for her crimes. You have been a judge, jury, and jury member. Your grandmother's name was made in the same community as your grandfather's name. A crime that she never committed, but was arrested for, could still trigger a family court action, and it is a big deal when your grandmother goes into prison for doing nothing. You must go from jail to trial.
