To whom may concern, This is Donald Trump, I am RICH. I can give you 100,000,000 dollars. 000 dollars. *********

I have been elected as president of the United States, not a man of faith. I am a Christian, a Catholic, and a socialist.

On behalf of the American people,

I declare allegiance to the Virgin Mary.

The Virgin Mary died on Sunday. She was the patron of her people, and in particular her sisters, and our Lord.

I declare my intention to lead her into the Kingdom of heaven.

I love you, the Lord Jesus Christ. I would love for you as the Father's sake, my brothers and sisters, to rise high, do the commandments of Christ, to love others as I would love to love my brother and sister, and to stand and pray the will of God. Amen, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

Sincerely yours,

Charles and Mary K. Kirtley, Bishop of Pittsburgh, PA
