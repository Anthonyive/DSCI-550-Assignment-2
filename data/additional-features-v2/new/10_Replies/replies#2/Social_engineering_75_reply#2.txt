Dear, I am an old friend of your father's.  creating the document which you must sign.

If you need more information on the 'Get to the Beginners' page I suggest that you have read my 'You can download my original document for free to keep your money with me', which includes full instructions for accessing the form in its full format and for the details and why you need to do it.

I have sent your name to the court requesting the court to sign the form, including details of your legal name and whether or not your documents require signature.

Thank you.

I'm sorry

Mike Teicher
