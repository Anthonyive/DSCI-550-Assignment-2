Hello, Your father abandoned me and my mother 10 years ago.10 years ago. I was just so young, I didn't have anything to have a family to eat. When my mother died from lung cancer, we moved out, and I was so proud of you. I have a daughter named Jessica now, and I was so, so sorry.

I feel so lonely. This isn't just a loss. I think that if I had been born 100% healthy and happy, my father and I would have lived forever, with one child. We need to support each other and let her do the hard work that she needs to do. It has to happen in our house, over the Internet and on our Internet. We need to keep the family together, together, and we need to make that happen. Please help me, Jessica. I am so sorry for what happened to my father. I am so sorry for all of you who lost your loved ones. Your mommy, my sister's, your cousins, your friends, your neighbors, and your entire family. It can never bring the pain of this to you but to let your little sister and your mother know that we still have your family, that we still care about you, and that we're still together. You were my sister's best friend, and you are our best friend.

I love
