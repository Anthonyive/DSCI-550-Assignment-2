Hi, You have an unpaid debt. unpaid debt. We're sorry.

It's been a long day, and so far many people have been able to help. It's been difficult, and a lot of work, but most important I'll never forget.

Today we are in the process of doing a re-write of the original script, in a very new and creative way. I know you've been in a similar situation, but it's an exciting change as well.

One of the things that I love about working in the field so far is the fact that it takes time, and there's not been one single person yet that knows how to do it.

I am here to take this opportunity to offer our help, and our advice and to make this process as easy and beautiful as possible for people who have outstanding financial obligations.

This re-write is being done in the name of saving time for the next project and to help create a work-life balance.

Please allow me to be in touch to share the time and effort I have put into making this process in a way that feels right for everyone. I have an excellent team here, including the original creator and many of the people involved, and I hope to get things done in a week, not the shorter run.
