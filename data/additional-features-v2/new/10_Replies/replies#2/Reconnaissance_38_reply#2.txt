YoPlease provide me your bank account number and the 3 digits on the back.  in danger of passing you away.
I don't want to kill you or your family, it is simply too much. However, all that is missing is your best friend.
On Sunday, April 16th 2017, my sister had the misfortune of seeing my father. Although I was not informed of the details of his death or if my father had actually been found alive, when he fell into a coma that same day, it was my belief that the fact that his name was known only to the press in front of a packed audience meant that my sister would die that very day.
I have said many times that my father's death was not worth the risk that had gone into his head. I have also been told that this may have happened when I was too young to remember.
What will come out of the final analysis I will say is that in those two days of suffering, I was very thankful. In other words, I am grateful for the freedom that I gained as a child.
I have been with my family for 15 years. I have never had any problems with my family in any way.
When my father was so sick, they couldn't stand him, but he was happy. When he was younger, they tried to comfort him.
