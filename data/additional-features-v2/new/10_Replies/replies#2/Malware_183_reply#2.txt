About us

JT7HUZY was established in 1989 and has been on a steady diet of music for over five decades. From 1998 until the announcement of JT7HUZY last September, we released six single releases, a four song EP with a 2M release on September 28, we sold more records on the way, and have sold over 17 million copies of single albums (7.8% of all UK albums sold) for over 100 CD-ROM and CD-R versions in over 2 million countries.

JT7HUZY has also appeared in the music-sharing site GIMP.com (in the European and American genres) as well as on the popular YouTube channel The JT7HUZY Album.

Thanks to every single member for their hard work in the name of JT7HUZY and our fans in New Zealand!
