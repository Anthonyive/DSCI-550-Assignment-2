Hey,Your grandfather has left you a heritage. have now lost both of their offices and

no longer represent me.

I sincerely apologize to those who have been

involved in these issues as well as to

all of our members in the United States.

Our Members are disappointed with this

rebellion, however many members are

protesting it on campus, and we will

continue to call for unity, in the effort to

protect

freedom and protect

American ideals from

the insidious influence of the

capitalist Right. We continue to stand with

the

protesters and will keep the

protesters

united by our fight for

freedom and

values.

people and you can and must stand up and stand up to people

against this.

I believe in

our

freedom.
