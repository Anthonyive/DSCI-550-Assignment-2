If you choose to do this, please send this email to rba.barbera@gmail.com with your bank email and include the PIN. If you leave this address empty you will get 1 month of account closure.

If you haven't done this previously, please contact me. ÂI have the ability to issue more than one order at any time. When I issue orders I ask that you include the order number and the date you sent the order.
