THANK YOU
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD.
LAGOS, NIGERIA
ATTENTION:MADAM/SIR
I am MR.USMAN ABACHA , the Director of Operations
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in
NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute
with years of outstanding service to the people of
Africa.
I have resolved to contact you through this medium
based on business proposal that will be of mutual
benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through
a consultant company base on my research for a
trustworthy and established person that understands
investment ethic for entering into a life time
profitable joint partnership investment and also
co-operation with confidence and trust that you will
keep the contents secret and divulged to any third
party.
To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time
early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a
consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.
And since then our client has failed to come forward
to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a
considerable amount of money in demurrage.
Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to
redeem the demurrage which his consignment had
accumulated we discovered that our client was the
former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who
died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same
year the consignment was entrusted into our care.
Since the death of our client President Mobutou
Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to
claim the consignment with us, which means that non of
his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to
secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited
in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the
two boxes that were registered as treasurer by our
client actually contained a considerable amount of
money in United States Dollars amounting to about
US$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have
been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from
enquiries and the foreign media that our late client
siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was
in office as head of state.
It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault
was part of the money that our client siphoned and now
that he is dead there is no race to this money in our
care.
I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me
in transferring this money out of nigeria to your
country for immediate investment with your assistance.
I have also decided that you will generously be
entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt
of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me
of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and
transfer all the rights of ownership of this
consignment to your name to facilitate your easy
clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your
country.
you have nothing to worry about, as I will  be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper
documentation.
This transaction is 100% risk free.
Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this
matter.
Thanks.
Yours faithfully.

Bonjour,
Cette proposition peut vous paraître étrange. Veuillez comprendre que c�est la situation que je traverse actuellement qui m�a poussée à contacter une personne totalement étrangère (vous) .
Permettez-moi de me présenter ; Je suis étudiante en droit commercial de la Sierra Léone, mon nom est James Foday SANKOH.
Je viens d�hériter d�une somme importante d�argent et je ne m�y connais pas en transfert international ni en placement. J�ai donc besoin de vous pour m�aider à transférer et à gérer cette fortune.
Mon défunt père Foday Sabanah Sankoh fut chef des rebelles du (R. U. F.), il contrôlait toute la zone diamantifère de la Sierra Léone. Avant sa mort le 29 Juillet dernier, il fut arrêté, emprisonné et condamné par le gouvernement de mon pays.
Mon père a eu l�idée ingénieuse de déposer en mon nom dans une société de sécurité et de gardiennage en République du Bénin ( Afrique de l�Ouest ) du nom de SOBECI SARL la somme d�argent de 50 millions de dollar américain. Le dépôt a été fait depuis 4 ans. Tous les documents originaux concernant ce dépôt sont en ma possession.
Je voudrais que vous m�apportiez l�assistance nécessaire pour pouvoir récupérer ces fonds et les transférer hors de l�Afrique.
Mon souhait est que l'argent soit investi dans de bonnes affaires et je crois que c'est une chance pour vous de m'assister car vous serez mon homme de confiance dans toutes mes affaires une fois la transaction terminée.
Ma maman et moi avions déjà contacté ici au Bénin un redoutable avocat du nom de maitre Robert Dossou pour nous assister pendant tout notre séjour ici à cotonou(capital du Bénin).
J�attends impatiemment votre réponse et vous suggère de contacter notre avocat Maître ROBERT DOSSOU de AITC(Association of Investement Trust Companies) pour plus d�explications.

Dear Sir,
I am Memuna Mousa from Kuwait. I am married to late Moulla Abass mousa of blessed memory who worked with kuwait embassy in Sudan for twelve years before he died in the year 2000.
We were married for eleven years without a child. he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both devoted Muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid problem.
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of ($10.5million (TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLAS) with a Bank somewhere in Europe. Recently, my doctor told me that i would not last for the next six months due to cancer problem. Though w
hat disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Muslim organization or devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instructs here in.
I want this muslim organization or individual to use this money all sincerity to fund mosques, orphanages, widows,and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to ensure that thesociety upholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran. The Holy Quran emphasiz
es so much on Allah's benevolence and this encourage me to take the bold step.
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are new christian's converts and I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons for taking this bold
decision. I know that after death I will be with Allah the most beneficent and the most merciful.
I don't need any telephone communication in this regard becasue of my health and becasue of the presence of my husbands' relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With Allah all things are possible. As soon as I receiv
e your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank where the money was deposited. I will also issue you a power of Arttorney to the Bank authorizing them that the said fund have been willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be forwarded to 
you. I want you and muslim community where you reside to always pray for me.
My happiness is that I lived a true devoted muslim life worthy of emulation. Whosever, that wants to serve Allah must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your rely will give room in sourcing 
for a Muslim organzation or a devoted Muslim for this same purpose.
Until I hear from you, my dream will rest squarely on your shoulders.May the Almight Allah contiune to guide and protect you.You can also reply to me through the alternative E-mail: memunamousa@survivormail.com

Dearest,
I am Chief Thomas Nimely yaya, chairman of the Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia (MODEL),now Foreign Minister in the transitional 
government, and also a first cousin to the deposed President 
of Liberia, Charles Taylor, who is presently in exile in one of the 
West African Countries.
During the reign of my cousin, Charles Taylor, I was
in-charge of all Diamond operations coming from
Angola, Sierra Leone, etc.  Then Charles Taylor enjoyed
the patronage of the rebels controlling parts of 
these countries, as tonnes of uncut diamond were
shipped to him, and he inturn through me sold these
diamonds to foreigners, and used the proceeds to buy
arms for the rebels in these countries, and a large
chunk of this money  was for the enrichment of the
rebel leaders. Literally speaking he  gave cover to the
rebel Leaders. This operation was code named: Conflict
Diamond. I cordinated the entire Diamond trade in the
sub-region and this ran into hundreds of Million of
Dollar.
While carrying out this operation, I was able to divert
the sum of US$45,000,000.00 (Forty-Five Million
United States Dollars) for my personal benefit, and
it is concelled into 4 Trunk Boxes and deposited as
artifacts materials with ecowas diplomatic Security and cargo unit 
in Accra-Ghana. 
The Security Company does not know the
true contents of the consignments. This is only known to you and 
me, and I hope you will keep this confidential.
Now that Charles Taylor is no more in Power, I thought
it wise to move the money out to any  country of the
world for investment purposes. Now I am contacting you
seeking your assistance to help me in transfering this
money to your country. All you need do is to make
necesary arrangement and fly down to Accra-Ghana, see the
money and talk about it.
Already, I have the consent of the Security Company Director in Accra-Ghana
who has agreed to help us move the consignments out through
Diplomatic means to their affilliate office in Europe. 
I am offering you 25% of the total amount involved for
assisting me while 5% is set aside for any expenses that might be incurred during
the completion of this project, and the remaining 70% will be used for any lucrative
investment you will introduce me into.
Best Regards,
Chief Thomas Nimely yaya.

dr_nimely@latinmail.comSeeking joint-venture partners for ERW oil casing project
Dear Sir or Madam:
We are keenly interested in setting up a new factory to produce 120,000 ERW oil casings per year to meet the big market of Shengli Oilfied. Since we lack some starting-up capital, we are seeking for investments. I will give you a brief introduction to the project as follow:
I. Background:
Shengli Oilfield, the second largest oilfield in China and the leading company of Sinopec Corp.

It is expected that the total oil casing needed in the above area is about 400,000 tons, including 260,000 tons in Sinopec and 150,000 tons in Shengli Oilfield. To meet the great need, we plan to set up a joint venture to produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings per year in Shengli Oilfield.  With good management and market outlets, we believe that this JV also has the potential to expand beyond China to other nations. 
II. About us

Its products have entering many areas as Shengli Oilfield, Daqing Oilfield, Liaohe Oilfield, Dagang Oilfield and so on. In 2002, the sale income amounted to over 600 million yuan.
The Factory holds Quality accreditations as ISO9001, API and so on.
III. Content of the project
It is planned to introduce Japanese technology and equipment to set up one production line with range of casing diameter from¦Õ114 to ¦Õ339.7 and produce 120,000 tons of ERW casings and delivery pipes per year.
IV. Product specifications

For delivery: grade of steel are X52¡¢X60¡¢X70, specification ranges from ¦Õ114 to ¦Õ339.7.
V. Economic Analysis
The total investment in this project is 142.41 million yuan. After the completion of the project, it is estimated that the internal financial rate of return before paying tax is 24.9 percent with a payback period of 5.6 years, and the internal rate of return after paying tax is 21.8 percent with a payback period of 5.9 years.
The break-even point of the project is 46.95 percent, which means the project can keep balance if the annual output amount to 42,000 tons.
VI. Plans for cooperation
We have set up a joint venture with Japan's Marubeni in the early of the year, with a registered capital of 57 million yuan. The capital structure is as follow:
a. Shengli Oilfield Bureau of Administration          19.95 million yuan   35£¥
b. Shengli Oilfield Engineering Machinery Facotry     17.10 million yuan   30£¥
c. Dongying District State Assets Operation & Management Co., Ltd 5.70million yuan 10£¥
d. Marubeni Engineering Technology Co., Ltd           14.25 million yuan   25£¥
To meet our capital need for this project, we are now planned to increase our registered capital to 118.88 million yuan. Taking our added investment into consideration, we need another 34.68 million yuan to get the plan executed. So we are seeking a new joint venture partner who'd like to join this project and meet our capital requirement.
We would like to exchange the information with the manufacturers and suppliers who are interested in this project and have discussion on raw material supply as well as jointly investing the factory establishment. And we hope we could have good cooperation in future.

Miss Elisabeth Kabba.I  NEED    YOUR  COPERATION
Assalam aalaikoom,
I am Abdul Ramatd.I am married to Late Kazeem Abdul
of blessed memory who is an oil explorer in Singapore
and Kuwait for twelve years before he died in the
year2000.We were married for twelve years without a
child.He died after abrief illness that lasted for
only
four days.Before his death we were both devoted
Muslims.Since his death I too have been battling with
both Cancer and fibroid problems. When my late Husband
was alive he deposited the sum of $15.5million
(Fifteen Million, Five Hundred thousand U.S Dollars)
with a Finance Company in oversea.
Recently,my doctor told me that I have only six months
to live due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me
most is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I
decided to donate this fund to either a Muslem
organization or devoted Muslim individual that will
utilize this money the way I am going to instructs
herein.
I want this Muslim organization or individual to use
this money in all sincerity to fund mosques,
orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of
ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views
and belief of the Holy Quran.
The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S
benevolence and this has encourage me to take the bold
step.I took this decision because I don't have any
child that will inherit this money and my husband
relatives are new Christian's converts and I don't
want a situation where this money will be used in an
Unholy manner.Hence the reasons for this bold
decision. I know that after death I will be with ALLAH
the most beneficent and the most merciful.
I don't need any telephone communication in this
regard because of my health, because of the presence
of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't
want them to know about this development. With ALLAH
all things are possible.
As soon as I receive your reply on Email:abdulramat10@yahoo.it <mailto:abdulramat10@yahoo.it> shall give you the contact
information of the Finance Company and the country in
oversea where the money was deposited.
I will also issue a letter of authority to the Finance
Company authorizing them that the said fund Have being
willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be
forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community
where you reside to always pray for me.
My happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims
worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH
must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always
be prayerful all through your life.Any delay in your
reply will give room in sourcing for a Muslim
organization or a devoted Muslim for this same
purpose. Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest
squarely on your shoulders.
May the Almighty ALLAH continue to guide and protect

Dearest In Christ, 
It is with Heavy Heart i am reaching you regarding the death of my 
late client. I am Barrister Robert Beaud, the legal adviser to late 
MR. MIKE  & CAROL HALL, a very Wealthy Couple that lived here in the 
United Kingdom, before their recent Death on the 26th of December 
during the Tsunami disaster last year 
(2004).http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4153821.stm) these 
couple served God as very dedicated Christians,they so dedicated their 
life to God but they had no child till they died. They acquired a lot 
of landed properties like lands, Stocks/Bond,house properties, etc. As 
their legal adviser, before their death, the husband Mr. Mike  & Carol 
Hall instructed me to write his WILL because they had no child, they 
dedicated their wealth to God. 
According to the WILL, their assets should be given out to a ministry 
for the work of God. As their legal adviser, all the documents for the 
assets that are deposited with the security company are in my care. He 
gave me the authority to give out the funds to the Ministries for the 
work of God. As instructed by  MR. MIKE HALL before his death. As a 
matter of fact the total amount of money that is contained in the two 
trunk Boxes is $10,000,000.00 ,They did not want the management of the 
Security Company to know the content of the consignments, therefore 
they registered the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the 
security company believes that what They deposited with them were Gold 
Bars. 
As a born again Christian,I have been reading my bible and I have to 
do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund 
to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by 
the owner before his death.After my fasting and prayers Today, I asked 
God to make his choice and direct me to an honest Christian or the 
chosen ministry that deserves this fund by his Grace. I then came 
across your address on the Internet as I was browsing through a 
Christian site.I appeal to you for the fund to be used wisely for 
things that will glorify the name of God. I have just notified the 
Security Company where they deposited the consignments that contained 
the fund, that I am moving the consignment abroad, and the security 
company is awaiting my authority to move the consignment out of the 
shores of my country. 
Dear child of zion, if you know that you will use this fund honestly 
and wisely for things that will glorify God's name, then do contact me 
with the above mentioned information via (rbeaud14@netscape.net) 
Your prompt response will be highly appreciated. 
Yours in Christ. 
Barrister Robert Beaud. From the smile and comfort of your home.

Greetings from the beautiful land of Zimbabwe.
I am Joseph Made of Lands, Agriculture, & Rural Resettlement ministry of
Zimbabwe.
As a member of cabinet and former stuanch supporter of President Mugabe's
government I was opportuned to be in the know as to what led to the
struggle for farm lands and subsequent fall out of my government with the
Western world. As of today I would be more than glad if the case of what
happened can be reversed as I have come to see that it was all in pursuit
of the selfish interest of one man, the president!
After all said and done, it has become obvious that my president like any
other African leaders needed to make sure that he remains in power to not
just consolidate his fortunes but also to make sure that he bleeds the
country to death by siphoning the money meant for developmental
infrastrure abroad. Of course with the help of some foreigners who do not
see anythng wrong in helping him steal the country blind.
I may very well be sounding like a disgruntled and dis-appointed person
but the truth is that he has shifted his gaze from the foreigners to his
own very people. He sees any suggestions or opinions that does not agree
with his own has been that of a sabortuer and the person therefore must
be purnished. In other words, we the followers have come to realise that
he feels threatened by not just our presence but coupled with the fact
that most of us are privy to what transpired and are very much aware of
the movement of large sums of money abroad.
As it stands now I and many others are of the strong opinion that sooner
or later it will be our turn to be flushed out of the composition of
members of cabinet and replaced with loyals who obviously have sworn to an
oath of allegiance and loyalty via fetish and ritualistic methods. This
being the norm does not appeal to some of us and therefore we are now
targets to be dismissed/disgraced from service or face possible
extermination.
I have contacted you on the consideration that I could discuss with you
the possibility of placing some funds with you for management purpose
either in your existing establishment or other venture to be undertaken
after due delibrations and under terms to be agreed upon. I will prefers
that this investment be made in your country if and when we have arrived
at a compromise.
I sincerely appologise for writing you via this means even without prior
established acquaintance. But I do beleive that as we get along you will
come to understand the reason for my writing through this means.
I thank you for taking time to read my letter and hope that you will
respond soon with any inquiries that may help you decide on your next line
of action.

FROM:                  MARY JOHN 
Beloved, 
I am the above named person from Liberia, presently staying in England. I am married to Mr. Cletus John who worked with Liberian Embassy in Zambia for nine years before he died in the year 2003. We were married for eleven (11) years without a child and he died after a brief illness that lasted for just four (4) days.
Before his death, we were both born- again Christians, since my husband’s death, I have decided never to re-marry or have a child outside my matrimonial home which the bible is against. When my late husband was still alive he deposited the sum of US$10,500,000.00 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only) with a Security Company in Europe in my name and this money is still with the Security Company up till this moment. Recently, my doctor notified me that I have less than eight (8) months to live due to my cancer problem but the one that bothers me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition, I decided to leave this fund in Europe.
I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavour that the house of God is fully maintained. My Bible tell me that "Blessed is the hand that gives, I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband’s relatives are not Christians and I do not want my husband’s effort to be used by un-believers.
I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way, this is the reason I am taking this decision, and moreover I am not afraid of death because I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of our Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the Lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. Telephone communications will be minimal in this regard because of my health and also being fully aware of the presence of my husband’s relatives and my doctors who are always around me. I do not want them to know about this development for I know that with God all things are Possible.
As soon as I receive your reply, I will inform the Security Company in Europe that you are the beneficiary of the said consignment and you will need to go and claim this fund in Europe. I will also issue you an authorization letter that will prove that you are the rightful beneficiary to the fund. I want you and your organization to always pray for me because the Lord is my Strength, Shepherd and my Help. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian and whosoever that wants to serve our Lord must serve him in spirit and in truth. Please always be prayerful for God is our source and once we are separated from our source, we are dead spiritually which automatically manifests in the physical.
Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for another person for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. If you want to talk by phone, you can send your telephone number by fax so that if my health permits me, I can call you or if you have message, you can equally call my doctor’s telephone number 00447040120051. DR. CHARLES
Hoping to receive your reply soon and remain blessed in the Lord.

While I was on the process, My Boss got arrested for his involvement in politics by financing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian president.

YOUR ROLE: 
All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and I will re-profile the funds with your name, which will enable the European bank transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this sum to relocate to American continent and never to be connected to any of Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates. 
The transaction has to be concluded in 2 weeks before Mikhail Khodorkovsky is out on bail. As soon as I confirm your readiness to conclude the transaction with me, I will provide you with the details. 
Thank you very much.

From: Mrs. Rose Welsh.

United Kingdom.
My Dear Beloved,
I am the above named person but now undergoing medical treatment in Barnes Hospital, South Wople Way, SW14 8SU, London, England. I am married to Dr. Gerald Welsh who worked with British Judicial Commission in Chelsea England for over a decade before he died on 5th of July in the year 2003. We were married for fifteen years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for two weeks. Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for the down trodden and the less privileged in the society. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home. 
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of £10 Million (Ten Million Pounds sterling) with one Finance/Bank in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 4 months due to a rare form of cancer of the pancreas. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an individual or better still a God fearing person who will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein.
Though I may not know you personally I want to tell you that, through
divine word of wisdom from above,I was asked to tell you to do this, not for me but for The Almighty because you are blessed and you have been chosen to do mighty works for the Almighty. I want an individual that will use this to fund and provide succor to poor and destitute persons, orphanages, and widows and for propagating peace in the universe. I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not inclined to helping poor persons and I do not want my husbands hard earned money to be misused or spent in the manner in which my late husband did not specify. 
I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Almighty. I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I do not want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Europe. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. I want you to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that wants to serve the Almighty must serve him with all his heart and mind and soul and also in truth.
Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your
reply will give me room in sourcing for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act according to my specification herein. I will also be most glad if you can tell me a little about yourself.Hoping to hear from you. Thank you and may the Almighty bless you.

Bismillahir Rahmaanir Raheem,
Assalamo Alaikum,
Wasalaam to you,and how are you doing?. My intention of contacting you is to solicit your assistance for a project,  which will be mutually beneficial. Though I know my decision to contact you is to a large extent unconventional, the  prevailing circumstances necessitated my action. I am Haleema  Hamza from Libya. I am married to Late Mallam Mustafa Hamza of blessed memory was an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years before he died in the year 2000. We were married  for twelve years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both devoted Muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid problems.When my late Husband was alive he made a huge deposit in millions of US dollars with a Deposit Company in oversea. (I will tell you the amount as we proceed).
Recently, my doctor told me that I have only few months to live due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Muslim organization or devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. My parents died at a tender age and i was brought up in the orphanage through the help of a devouted muslim.I want this Muslim organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund mosques,  orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran.
The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encouraged me to take the bold step. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are into some radical Organizations and I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons for this
bold decision, I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most beneficent and the most merciful. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health, because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. With ALLAH all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply on Email:hhamza@cooltoad.com, I shall give you the contact information of the Deposit Company in oversea where the money was deposited. I will also issue a letter of authority to the Deposit Company authorizing them that the said fund have being willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community where you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims worthy of emulation, Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness. I will not stipulate any precise amount to reward you, as it will have to be on pre-negotiated terms, based on your level of involvement.
Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give room in sourcing for a Muslim organization or a devoted Muslim for this same purpose. Until I hear from you by email, my dreams will rest squarely on your Shoulders. May the Almighty ALLAH continue to guide and  protect you.

I am a preacher with the Seed Harvest Ministry,and I will like to get advice
from you.I believe the advice I need is secular to some extent, but do have
the patience to understand my intention.  
A few year's ago I was in Baghdad,Iraq where I had established a little
congregation where I preached regularly,but the war escaleted and the church
was converted to a hospital of soughts. Before then, On one faithfull day
three American Soldiers came to me and left a trunk box of Money with me and
swore to come back for it. 
When the war in Iraq intensified I was escorted to My country Benin Republic
West africa, by the U.S soliers who felt the content of the trunk box was
church documents and never cared to check the trunk box,, when I was getting 
fraustrated I returned to Iraq only to find out that two of the three Soldiers
died in Battle while the last was decleared MIA (Missing in Action). 
Now I have the fund which belongs to the soldiers and which is Eight million
us dollars ($8,000.000.00),but i have deposited it with a security company
here in my country Benin Rep, and I was contacted in a letter dated 10th of
May.2006 by the company asking me to indicate if I was in reciept of the
letter as a sign that I am still living and still subscribed for their
service.  
I am interested in using a small fraction of this money,much less than ten
percent for a re-organisation of the work, but I do not need the rest and do
not want to have any direct dealing with it, I need someone who will be able
to use the fund better maybe for charity or something universally profitable,
I have thought of doing it my self but, my ministry is the apocalypse and I
believe and preach the soon comming  which make me not indulgent in reliance
on money or wealth in any form. 
I also do not have the money that has accrued on the service and safe deposit
of the company that holds the trunk box, I will be glad if you have any
interest in the direction of maybe managing or transmitting the fund as you
prefer in your capacity like using it to help the motherless and people in the
3rd world countries. I will like you to give me 
your phone  number for easy and good communication.  I will be glad to get a
response from you through my 
direct email address pastor_jonesbell@mail.ru  
Regards.

My name is Mrs. hilda Ahmed from Iraq. I am married to Dr.Hassan Ibrahim, who worked with shell Petroleum Company in Iraq for twelve years before he died after a brief illness. We were married for eight years without a child. Since we married we were both
Islamic couple members. After his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home.
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$6.5 Million (six million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with International Diplomatic service firm in Malaysia with purpose to invest the fund in Islamic foundation before death took him, The fund is still
under safe keeping with the International Diplomatic firm in Malaysia, hence and contacting you to help me to achieve this project in your country.
During the current war in my country all the property and the asset of my husband were destroyed I don’t have anything left on behalf of my husband except this fund that’s deposited with the Diplomatic service company in Malaysia, now am undergoing a serious sickness that
resulted to be stroke and cancer problem, I had tried all my best to treat myself with every medical expert but there is no improvement, Currently  my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problems. Having known my condition, I
decided to donate this fund to mosque, Islamic school authority or better Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I instruct here. I want this fund to be disbursing to, orphanages, widows promoting the work of almighty Allah, needies and to promote work of almighty Allah in your country. The Koran made us to understand that blessed is the hand that gives. I took this decision because I don’t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are Christians and unblivers.I don’t want my husband hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers because I know he will be rejoicing in the blossom of Allah if these fund spend to promote the work of almighty Allah. I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I
am going to be in the heaven. I don’t need any telephone communication in this regard because my health and the presence of my husband relatives around me always. I don’t want them to know about this development. With Allah all things are possible. As
soon as I receive your reply i will instruct to the DIPLOMATIC operation manager and my husband lawyer in Malaysia to furnish you with more details on how to
receive my fund.
I will also instruct him to issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the
original-beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the Muslim to always pray for me because in almighty Allah I put my hope. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Muslim. Whosever that wants to serve Allah must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be
prayerful all through your life. And reply me through my alternative e-mail address as delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a another faith member for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here in.
As  i am disabled and can not be able to move around and do much due to am presently very ill, I will really appreciate it for you to contact me through my Email address.(hilda_ahmed@excite.com) as the internet is my only mean of communicating. Or through the help of nurse here who is so kind to assist me in the
hospital and taking care of me (fahmeedabdiwahad@excite.com )
Hoping to hear from you soonest.
Remain blessed in the name of the Allah.

GARDNERDear Sir,  
I am Mrs Aminat Mohamed  from Liberia, presently staying in Germany. I am married to Mr. Hassan Mohamed who worked with Liberian embassy in Lome-Togo for Ten years before he died in the year 2002.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief  illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born again Moslim.
Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home which the Quran is against. When my late husband was  alive he deposited the sum of $6.8Million (Six Million Eight hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to keep this fund in Europe.
I want an organization or an individual that will use this fund for orphanages, idows,propagating the word of Allah and to endeavor that the house of Allah is maintained. The Holy Quran made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision  because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Moslim and I don't want my husbands efforts 
to be used by unbelievers.
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the  bosom of the Almighty Allah .I don't need any telephone  Communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about 
this development. With Allah all things are possible. 
As soon as I receive your reply I shall inform the security company in Europe that you are the beneficiary of the said consignment you will need to go and claim this fund in Europe. I will also issue you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the organization to always pray for me  because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Moslim. Whoever that wants to serve the Allah must serve  him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your  life.
Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person  for this same  purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.  Hoping to receive your reply and  Remain blessed in the Allah.. 
Yours in Allah ,

Dearest.
I am Mrs Aminatu Abubaka Arikama, 
from Sierra Leone republic, residing in  Cote d'Ivoire. I am married to 
Mr Abubaka Arikama, who deals in Cocoa and Gold business in Cote d 
Ivoire for twenty five years before he died in the year 2002. We were 
married for twenty years God give us a son, his name is Abubaka Arikama 
Jr who is 17 now, and because of my husband love to me he refused to 
marry another wife.
He died after a brief illness from food poison 
which lasted for only four days. Since his death I decided not to 
remarry or get another child outside my matrimonial home, my husband 
relatives was responsible for his death because they want to inherit 
the entire legacy, I was ill and my son is still a little boy.
Before 
the death of my husband he deposited a huge amount (US$11.8M) in a 
finance house here in Cote d Ivoire, Since my Doctor told me that I 
have a little time left (about Six months) due to cancer problem. 
Having known my condition and I can not survive this cancer illness, 
and I don't want to lose my only son, I decided to transfer this fund 
and my son out of this country.
I took this decision because I don't 
want to lose every thing my husband has worked for, and my husband 
relatives are not even good at all because they are responsible for the 
death of my husband in other to have all his properties and I don't 
want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his 
death and they will still kill my son if they have the opportunity.
fund transfer will base on the option you prefer, (1) bank to bank 
transfer (2) through a diplomatic channel to your address, the finance 
house is ready to transfer the fund with any of the option we agreed 
on, as soon as I receive your reply of accepting to help me I will give 
you all the details including your percentage for assisting me in this 
legitimate transaction.
Thanks.
May God be with you.

Dear Sir,
I am Amina Idris from the State of Kassala in the Eastern part of Sudan. I recently lost my husband who until his death was a serving officer with the SPLA here in Sudan. He died in the cause of performing his duties under the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS).
Before his death he was privileged to have served close the powers that be in my country and this exposed him to huge sums of money of which about $7.5 Million was left to my surviving son and I.
I am contacting you because I need a big favor from you as regards receiving these funds on our behalf and help us invest it in a profitable venture. Due to my inexperience in matters of business, I am willing to give free rein of affairs to you in the day to day running of such a business venture.
Please if you are willing to assist me, don’t hesitate to reply and indicate your interest as soon as possible.
Thanks and best regards.

RE: TRANSFER OF US$25 MILLION
FOR INVESTMENT.
I am Mr. Jackson khumalo, the Director of Delivery/Operations in a security company here in South Africa. Our firm is a security company of high repute with years of outstanding service to the people of Africa especially top government officials and military leaders in the world. I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on 
Business proposal that will be of mutual benefit to both of us. I have not discussed this transaction with anybody because it is of top secret. To be explicit and straight to the point, a reputable client of ours deposited a consignment in our company's 
Vault for safekeeping. And since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a
considerable amount of money in demurrage.  Consequently, in our bide
to contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his 
Consignment had accumulated I discovered that our client was the former Late Prime
Minister of Lebanon, Mr. Rafik Hariri,
PROFILE
of the Late Minister of Lebanon: Rafik Bahaa Edine Hariri {November 1,
1944 � February 14, 2005} married to Nazek Audi  Hariri, was a Lebanese
self � made billionaire and business tycoon, and was former 
Prime Minister of Lebanon {1992 � 1998 and 2000 � 2004} before his late
resignation from office on October 20, 2004. The late Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 300 kg
of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the Saint George
Hotel in the Lebanese capital, for more information please log on to
{http://www.hariri.info}.
After in the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care. Since the death of  our client Late Prime Minister of Lebanon,Mr. Rafik Hariri,none of his benefactors has  come forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his relatives or 
Aids had any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of
curiosity I decided to secretly open the box that our client deposited
in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the metal box that
were registered as treasures by our client actually  contained a
considerable amount of money in United States Dollars amounting to
about US$25Million US Dollar. Since this development I have been
nursing plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and the
foreign media that our late client siphoned a lot of money from his
country while he was in office as Prime Minister, It is my conviction
that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our
client siphoned and now that he is dead there is no trace to this
money in our care. After going through his (WILL) I 
Found that he stated that the treasure should be used to support (Islamic race).
Finally, I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist
me in transferring this money out of South Africa to your country for
immediate investment. I have also decided that you will generously be
entitled to 40% of the total amount. Upon my receipt of your reply
confirming your willingness to assist me of this transaction, I 
Will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and
transfer of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment.
This transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute
confidentiality on this matter. Please reply on my private mail

Attn:President/Ceo. 
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION, 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY). 
I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry 
as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to 
seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction 
which is of mutual benefit. 
I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and 
Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporatio(NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign 
firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the 
tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The 
over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the 
project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense 
Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to 
provide for us. 
SHARE: - 
For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you 
will be entitled to 30% of the money,60% will be for me andmy 
partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover 
any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this 
transfer,both locally and international expenses. 
I would require the following: - 
. Your company's name,address,telephone and fax numbers. 
The above information would be used to make formal applications as a 
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer 
to your account. 
It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects 
of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company 
won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. 
More often than not,big trading companies or firms of unrelated 
fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms 
for execution of such contracts. 
We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank 
of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no 
doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get 
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. 
Therefore,when the business is successfully concluded we shall 
through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the 
concerned Government Ministries for 100% security. 
We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once 
in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be 
transferred to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present 
Democratic Government start Auditing all Federal Government owned 
Parastatals. 
Please contact me immediately through my telephone number whether or 
not you are interested in this deal.If you are not,it will enable me 
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. Butwhere 
you are interested,send the required documents aforementioned herein 
through my above telephone number,or 
email:edema_ma@mauimail.com,because time is of the essence in this 
business. 
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. 
Yours faithfully, 
Edema Martins.

ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTOR
I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal Ministries in lagos-Nigeria. 
During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity. 
I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.
It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. 
I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. 
If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via Fax:234-1-7597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. I expect your urgent response.

David.

Compliments of the season. I would like to firstly send to
you the best wishes of good health and success in your
pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in
this letter. Before going into details of my proposal to
you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost
confidentiality, as this is required for its success.
My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal
Government of Nigeria,s Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who
are interested in diverting some funds that are presently
floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your
assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated
account the said floating funds. We are determined to
conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of
2003. The source of the funds is as follows: During the
last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set
up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were
grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and
parastatals. The present civilian government set up the
contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the
instruments of payments made available to it by the decree
setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if
necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.
My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of
these funds which are presently floating in the Central
Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to
divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue
of our positions as civil servants and members of this
panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the
names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have
therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my
colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas
partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of
U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred
thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this
letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into
your account, if you agree with our proposition as
follows; (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for
us (the panel officials (iii)10% to be used in settling
all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the
actualization of this project.
We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project
in foreign stock markets and other business till we are
ready and able to have access to them without raising any
eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is
100% safe and risk-free. We
Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking
days from the date of receipt of the following information
through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name,
Company’s name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the
account number into which the funds should be paid. The
above information will enable us write letters of claim and
job description respectively. This way, we will use your
company’s name to apply for the payment and backdate the
award of the contract to your company. We are looking
forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit
for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my
direct Telephone number 234 8033064962 and my America
Internet Fax number 1 92896 27169
It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will
bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction
when I hear from you.

FROM THE DESK OF
DR. BELLO MUSA
N N P C.
ATTN,
MUTUAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
I am Dr. BELLO MUSA.The chief accountant of The 
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I
head five man tender board in charge of contract award
and payments approvals.I came to know of you in my 
search for a reliable person to handle a very
confidential transaction which involves the transfer
of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.
There were series of contracts executed by aconsortion
of multinationals in the oil industry in favour of
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among
which were for the following:-1. The expansion of the
pipelines network within for a crude down stream
products distribution and subsequent evacuation:- $8,
Billion United States Dollars.2. Contract for the turn around maintenance
(TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States
Dollars.
3. The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum
products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.
The original value of these contracts were delebrately
over invoiced in the sum U$69,000.00 (sixty nine Million
United States Dollars Only) which has now been
approved and is now ready to be transferred, being
that the companies that actually executed these
contracts have been fully paid the projests officially
commissioned.It does not matter whether or not 
your comapny does contracts project of that nature
described here, the assumption is that your company
won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to
other companies.
Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to
transfer the total  amount to your account for subsequent disbursement,
since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau
(civil service laws) 
from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our
names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at
this junction enormous. In return, we have agreed to
offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall
be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and
external) between the parties in the course of the
transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,The
Nigerian  officials.
Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the ministry of finance and the central bank of
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within
14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the
above stated terms.Our assurance is that your role is risk free,
I accord this transaction the legality it
deserves and for mutual security of the fund, the
whole approval procedures will be officially and
legally processed with the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the
above mentioned amount.
Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we
shall through our same connections withdraw all
documents used from all the concerned government
ministries for 100% security risk free.Once more, I
want you to understand that having put in over 19
years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful
to have my image and career deemed.
Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether
you are or not interested in this deal, if you are
not, it will enable us scout  for another foreign partner
to carry out this deal but where you are interested 
send the required documents.One blank letter head, one
invoice sheet and your bank particulars through my
above address as time is not on our side in the business.
Send by Email for security reasons.
Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest
co-operation.
Very truly yours,
Dr. bello musaFOREIGN PARTNER
Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not met, permit me however, I am Mr. Lawrence Abba, a Zimbabwean Farmer.
I am contacting you as the need to for me to have a foreign partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a private company in that region, as the present political instability in my country Zimbabwe, does not encourage financial investment as the environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is not insured, just as reported by international media.  I got your contacts through personal research and out of desperation I decided to reach you through this medium. I will give you more information as regards to this as soon as you reply and I repose great confidence in you hence my approach due to security network place on us and I hope you will not let me out to security personal.
This problem started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President Robert Mugabe announced a degree on May 31st 2000 to seize more than 849 white-owned farms.  So far, more than 1,400 white owned farms have been invaded and confiscated, as well as claiming the properties of the farmers. Consequently, most of my colleagues and our properties were seized again putting us to total confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the administration of President Mugabe in my country and we where subjected to psychological torture by the security agents in the country. Some of my friends are still under detention, although arrangements are being made for their release, now I have no confidence with anybody within my country.
During these periods, as reported by some international media including the CNN, so many white farmers were killed, the government is not stopping at this, as just recently the government have asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in this country Zimbabwe for so many years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives. Therefore, I decided to contact you, for your assistance, so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I am a foreigner.
For this purpose, I have put in a security deposit all monies from the sale of my farm and farming equipments (including tractors etc) which amounted to US$6.5Million, I had to move the money out of the country through a very secret arranged channel in a very unconventional method by my friend an official at the "Security Minting  & Printing Company" of my country.  Presently, the money is in an Oversea Country, under the custody of a private security firm whose name is withheld for now until we open communication.
I will upon receiving your consent prepare every document to enable you receive this money on my behalf, pending my arrival to meet with you in your country so that we can both make further arrangements with regards to establishing the company.
As a partner you will be entitled to 20% stake in whichever company that you both decide to establish when I arrive your country.
I am waiting urgently for your response and please treat with utmost confidentiality.
Best Regards
Lawrence Abba.AWAITING YOUR SINCERE RESPONSE

Dear,
I am Mr. Kenneth Iloka, Personal Assistant to Alhaji Rewani Lukeman, the
Presidential Adviser on Petroleum Matters. My message to you is based
on some money that floated into the Government treasury due to the
recent boom in the International Oil Market.
The Federal Government of Nigeria budgeted US$18.00 per barrel in last
Year budget, but the price was changed in the international oil market
where a barrel was sold between US$28-US$35.00.
We recorded Excess gain, and all these could not be accounted for,
hence some executive members in the Petroleum Ministry decided to take away
the sum of US$18,532,700.00, (Eighteen Million Five Hundred and Thirty
Two Thousand Seven Hundred United States Dollars) to an offshore
account of a foreign National or company.
Please we are not contacting you because we cannot do this business on
our own successfully, but because we are not allowed to operate foreign
accounts as civil servants, that is why we are looking for a foreigner
we can use and knowing fully well that as a white man, the movement of
the fund will raise no doubt that is why we have decided to contact
If you are interested to assist us, please let me have your personal
telephone, fax and email address, so that I can furnish you with further
details on the modalities of the transfer of the fund into your bank
account. Please you are advised to keep this matter to your self, as we
do not want it to be exposed in order not to jeopardize our chances of
succeeding. Let it be known to you that this transaction is hundred
percent risks free and your security has been well taken care off. If you
are interested in this transaction, call me immediately
through my private telephone number 234-1-776 4163 or send me a email

 Dear sir,
This business will be of interest to you and your business and involves $30,000,000.00, which emanated from over invoiced contracts executed on behalf of my ministry of minerals and Energy, by foreign contractor.
Though the actual contract value has been paid to the original contractor, GUILDER MINING (PTY) SA, now in-liquidation. We have however included our billforthe over invoiced amount of US$30m amongst the present bills that are scheduled for payment in the name of the company in-liquidation. We have also planned the execution of this deal perfectly both in the area of documentation and the changing of beneficiary from the company in liquidation that we had used to apply for payment, to the name, which you will forward to us. I shall supply you with all the relevant documents relating to this transaction as soon as we establish a working relationship.
. This transaction is itself risk free and should be concluded within the next ten to fourteen working days if you follow my instructions carefully and we work closely as a team. . Where you are going to come in is this. We are going to effect a change of company name from GUILDER MINING (PTY) SA to your company so as to legalize your company as the bona fide beneficiary of the contract sum. In this regard we will do the incorporation of your company here and reflect your company as having taken over the assets of Guilder Mining (pty). Once we complete this process, your company will now be legally entitled to the US$30m, which the Department of Minerals and Energy owes GUILDER MINING (PTY) SA. We will thereafter use your company's name to apply for the payment of the US$30m into your company's designated account. This application we will process here in my Ministry and the approved Payment Recommendation sent to the Ministry of Finance, whi!
ch will authorize the South African Reserve Bank to effect the transfer of the fund to your designated account. For assisting us with a receiving account and a company name, we propose 20% of the contract amount of US$30m for you and 10% for taxes, phone, fax and other incidental expenses that we may incur in the course of the eventual realization of the transaction.
Meanwhile, please send me your confidential telephone/fax numbers, to
enable us to speak first and know ourselves better. You can also contact me on my confidential sat phone-00+871763427855 fax-00+871763427856. I promise that you will not regret helping us, you have my personal word of honor. My colleagues and I strive for the commitment to operate only on high standards of integrity and honesty. We need the same honesty and commitment to this transaction from you.
Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.
My Sincere Regards.

My name is Mr. Koffi Joseph. I hail from the Federal Republic of Ghana, 41 years young married, with three children. I am the Director of Global Security & finance Services Limited Ghana. I got the information concerning you from the Internet and after due consideration, I decided to contact you believing that by the grace of God, that you will not disappoint me over this deal. I have been working with this company for over ten years. Within this period, I have watched with meticulous precision how African Heads of State and Government functionaries have been using global security & finance Ltd. to move sums of money USD, pounds sterling, French francs (cash) to their foreign partners. They bring in these consignments of cash and secretly declare the contents as jewelries, Gold, Diamonds, Precious stones, Family treasures, and documents etc. Gen. Sani Abacha of Nigeria (dead), Mobutu Sese Seco of Zire (dead), Fode !
Sankoy of Sierra Leone, Babangida of Nigeria, Felix Houphet Boigny of Cote d' Ivore (dead), Kanan Bedie of Cote d' Ivore (Abidjan) etc. All these people have hundreds of consignments deposited with my office. Their foreign partners, friends and relatives are claiming most of these consignments. A lot of them are lying here unclaimed for as much as eight years. Nobody will ever come for them because in most cases, the certificate of Deposit are never available to any body except the depositors or with me hence most of them are dead. I have Re-deposited all these overstayed consignment into the Vault Facility of Reputable Bank in Ghana waiting to hear from you. Since the inception of the year 2000, our company's management has changed the procedure of claims of consignment, as soon as you are able to produce the secret information as contained in the secret file of any consignment, it will be released to you upon demand. From our record=2!
C more than 160 consignments belonging to Gen. Abacha, Mobutu sese
Seko has been claimed in the past six months and this is why am soliciting for your maximum cooperation and assistance. Gen. Abacha has 160 consignments deposited with several names and codes. 64 have been claimed in the past six months. The first son of Gen. Abacha died in a plane crash and the second son (Mohammed) is facing a murder charge and embezzlement, the family members are under house arrest without communication with the outside world. I have finalized every arrangement for you to come and claim consignment No: 1401, 1402 containing $46 million. I will supply you with all the information and documents and you will send it by attachment to the management of our company. The procedure is simple: Apply officially to the director of foreign operations of the company, requesting for the release of consignment No: 1401, 1402. They will demand for the certificate of deposit and the secret code and reference code of the consignments.!
I will supply them to you and they invite you to come and receive your consignments. I am responsible to take you to the bank where the consignment is secured. I will use your name, address, passport number to change the original documents in the file and every thing will be ok hence I am in charge. In conclusion, I assure you that this business is risk free because I have taken preventive measures to forestall the leakage of this business. (Our mode of sharing is 50-50), you can reach me by e-mail and I will direct you on what to do.

yours Faithfully,

Dear friend,
I am Domas k, yankThe son of former minister of finance (Domas Makabo) of the Republic of Sierra-Leone West Africa based on the information I gathered from your chamber of commerce and industry on your credibility, I decide to contact for the assistance.
Regarding my zeal toward foreign investment and security for my life and possession, I therefore write to you a break down of this proposal.
My father died when a group of rebel soldier led by Sir Foday Sankoh
overthrown Government of sierra-Leone forcing the president out of power and killing many members of the cabinet and minister including my own father. When it become apparently obvious that the country no longer safe for the citizens due to the political war and massive killing and destruction of properties, I decided to move to Holland with a treasure containing the sum of US$12.500.000.00(twelve million five hundred thousand united state dollars) through a diplomatic means, this fund is the last tangible money my father left behind before his death.
The said amount is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am
currently seeking political asylum. While the consignment containing the fund is in the custody of the diplomatic courier company they are not aware of the content as it was deposited as personal effect and artifact. I am seeking for partner who will serve as a the guardian of this fund with whom I could plan the best way to move this money out of Holland for investment which is my main purpose of contacting you.
Thus I decided to offer you 20% of the total money for assisting me to
actualize this project while 10% of the money has been set aside to offset any incidental expenses that might incurred during the course of this funds and the balance 70%shall be for me and my family which shall be invested in your country. And are will visit you country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment. I shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.
Thank you
God bless you

with a security firm abroad whose name is witheld for now
until we open communication.I shall be grateful if you
could receive this fund into your account for safe
keeping.This arrangement is known to you and my son alone,

whole being.The name of my son is Mustapha. I am seriously
considering to re-marry if you desire as soon as this fund

of dollars from various projects I executed successfully I had plans 
to > invest this money for future on real estate and industrial production.

I secretly deposited this money valued at about $30 millon us dollar 
with a security that deals with transhipment of value googs through a 
diplomatic courier services to the adhoc offices. The consignment or 
boxes I declared owned by my foreign business partner.

ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATES.
Dear sir,
I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of works and Housing in Nigeria. Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the completion of the transaction.Hence our desire to have an overseas agent.
I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction. The deal in brief is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use. For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent. Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction, all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us . As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use o!
ur own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as our agent . It might interest you to note that last year, a similar transaction was carried out with one MR. CHIENCHEN YU of Taiwan but after securing the payment approvals, and payment effected, MR.CHIENCHEN YU changed his numbers and addresses, and was no where to be found on our getting to Taiwan.
That was how we lost US$7.5Million. So this time around , I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to avoid future occurrence and allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen. You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal, through email.
After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through. If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindly destroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and
interest of the personalities involved.
Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.
Best Regards,
Dr.Bola Harry.

Investment proposal from:
Dr. Tunde Cole.
Block 4 Federal Secretariat Complex,

Ikoyi-Lagos
ATTENTION:
REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
I am Dr. Tunde Cole the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of USD$31,500,000.00 (thirty one million five hundred thousand united state Dollars).
This amount has been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say,
the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for Incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course.
Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord this transaction the legality It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bona- fide beneficiary. Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having
my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by responding to this email so that I can brief you further. I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the second quarter payments for the 2003 financial year.
Thanks and God bless.
Dr.Tunde Cole.Dear Sir, 
My name is Venus Savimbi, the nephew of the late 
jonas savimbi the former leader of the UNITA rebel 
fighters in Angola. I am presently in Europe, where I 
intend to look for a credible business partner to 
assist my brother and I take physical pocession of a 
consignment of money, precisely US$25,500,000:00 
(Twenty five million five hundred thousand united 
states dollars) which my uncle kept under the custody 
of my father in a security company in Ghana. 
My parents was killed along with my uncle, and in his 
will he clearly stated that my brother and I should 
look for a credible individual who would assist us in 
investing these funds, as we are not conversant with 
investment procedures in the world business and we 
have never been in posession of such funds all our 
lives. For these reasons, he believes that the only 
way we can live without him is if we get someone very 
vast in the field of business and investment to help 
us claim the funds and invest it on our behalf, so we 
can further our educations, as well as living our 
lives the way he wants us to. 
My brother is in Ghana, looking after the money in the 
security company, and he has asked that I travel out 
to Europe to look for a foreign partner to assist us. 
I would furnish you with his telephone numbers as soon 
as I receive your response, so you can deal with him 
directly, as he has all the modalties for the release 
of the consignment. 
We have both decided that we would make available to 
you for your assistance, 15% of the total sum of money 
involved, but we have also decided to leave it open to 
negotiation. 
I would give you more details as soon as I hear from 
you. Till then I expect your prompt response. 
Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,
RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
I am CHIEF(DR.)BODE GEORGE., Chairman to the Contract Review
Panel that was recently inaugurated by the President of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria to review the activities of past military government with
particular reference to contracts awarded by all ministries between 1990
to 1999. In the course of carrying out our assigned duties, we discovered
the sum of USD40.5 (forty million, five hundred thousand dollars) only lying
idle in a suspense account with our apex bank. This funds emanated from
grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate of foreign firms
by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation. On completion of our assignment, this amount was
deliberately not included in our report because we want to capitalize on
this once in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it.
The only option we have to achieve our aims and objective is to have this
fund transferred to a country of our choice where it can be kept in trust
and safe custody for us. We are however handicapped at the moment by
our status as civil servants, which barred us from operating foreign
accounts while still in government service.
Thus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce,
you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private
entrepreneurship. On this premise, we have no doubt in your ability to
handle a business of this nature, which informed our desire and wish to
enter into a partnership with you. This business involves the remittance of
this amount into your bank account with the hope of travelling down to
meet you physically in order to receive our share. We hope to invest some
in profitable ventures in your country based on your advise while the
balance will be repatriated home as foreign earnings. We have mapped
out strategies and all paperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success.
The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in
the world over, bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world
countries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for
execution. That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those that
executed one of such projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-
invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has
been paid. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free as there
is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future for we are well
connected in official circle. Given our level of commitment at the moment,
we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part, the objective
of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of
two weeks. It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the
transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum, 75% will be for
my colleagues and I.
If you are interested in this proposal, please call or send me an e-mail
VIA:bode_george@xuppa.com for more clarifications. If however
you are not interested, still let me know to enable me search for someone
else to carry out this business with.
I anticipate a timely response from you.
Thanks.
Yours Sincerely,
CHIEF(DR.)BODE GEORGEThank You.
Attn: The President /ceo 
Dear, 
By way of introduction I am Mr.Idris Umar working in the credit and accounts department Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos, Nigeria. I write you in respect of a foreign customer with Domiciliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha. 
Since the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank. 
Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe . 
By this doing, what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to 
understand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us. 
Trusting to hear from you, I remain 
Respectfully yours, 
Mr. Idris Umar.

Pretoria,
South Africa. 
Dear Sir/madam, 
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on
behalf of my colleagues. Your information were given
to me by a member of the South African Export
Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the 
Black Economic Empowerment Commission (Government)
delegation on a trip to the United States during a
bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign
investors. I have decided to seek a confidential 
co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder
for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep
it confidential because of the nature of this
business. 
Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work
as the Director of Project Implementation, with
co-operation of two other top officials, we have in
our possession, an overdue payment in US funds. 
The said funds represent certain percentage of the
contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a
foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced to the amount of US$26,400,000.00 
(Twenty Six Million Four Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has
been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed. 
The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe
that private investment in general, and foreign direct
investment in particular, are the real engines for
sustainable economic development, for which reason it
has continued to encouraged investment in the key
growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere
determination to pay foreign contractors all debts
owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close
relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation
with foreign governments and non-governmental
financial agencies. As a result we included our 
bills for approvals with the co-operation of some
officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve
Bank of South Africa (RBSA). 
We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary
of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to
operate foreign account. The changing of beneficiary's
information/ details and other forms of documentation
upon application for claim to reflect the contract 
money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of
your company or your self. 
I have the authority of my colleagues involved to
propose that, should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be
20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and
the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all
expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so
incurred. 
It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of the nature described here. The
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and subcontracted it to other companies. More often
than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated
fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more
specialized firms for execution. 
This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat
it with utmost confidentiality. Also your
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. 
I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further
details, upon your acceptance of this proposal. 
Regards, 
Engr. Ali RazakWarm Heart
Dear Partner,
Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani
Abacha the late former head of state of Nigeria in June
1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion,
frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian
administration, I have been subjected to physical and
psychological torture by the security agents in the country.
My son is still under detention arraigned before the federal
high court of Nigeria for an offernce he did not commit.
As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence
with anybody within the country.You must have heard over
the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various
huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different
security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up
their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged
there and many outrightly blackmail us. In fact the total
sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of
US$700.Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make
me poor for life. You may be surprise how I got to know but
I will tell you when you reply. I repose great confidence
in you hence my approach to you. due to security network
placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit
the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I
hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have
deposited the sum of U.S 40.3 million dollars with a security
firm abroad whose name is witheld for now until we open
communication.I shall be grateful if you could receive this
fund into your account for safe keeping. This arrangement is
known to you and my son alone, my son will deal directly with
you as security is up my whole being. The name of my son is
Mustapha. I am seriously considering tore-marry if you desire
as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start
all over again with you if you wish, but if don‘t want to
marry me just help me in diverting this fund into your
account which will accrue you 30% of this fund.
Please honesty is the watch word in this transaction.
Please forward your private your telephone and fax number
so that we can commence communication immediately.
In case you don‘t accept please don‘t let me out to the security.
I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith.Please expedite action.

Garki- Abuja-Nigeria
Dear
My nameis MR MR.ODIASE GEORGE.chairman of the contract award committe of the.
Federal Ministry of Aviation. Sometime last year,the Federal Government of Nigeria decided to upgrade the Radar and Landing facilities at the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport,kano inNorthern Nigeria.The contract ran into several millions of
Dollars.
The contract was handled by a foreign firm but because of the
huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided toover-invoice the
contract sum. Now the contract has been completed and the
original contractor has since been paid, but the contract balance
of US$12.5 million, which resulted from the over invoiced
contract sum that has been left in a suspense account with the
CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA, is what me and my partners are planning
to take out of the country for ourselves. The problem is as
government officials, we are not supposed to own fat bank
accounts, talk less of having foreign ones. To this end, we are
soliciting your assistance as a foreign partner who can assist us
and receive this amount into your account. We are ready to share
this money with you on the basis of participation. We also have
plans to invest part of this money in any viable business in your
country under your care, as we are very close to retirement age.
In any case, I received a reference of you on the net while
looking for a potential and reliable partner. Please if you
accept my proposal do not hesitate to send me an e-mail, so that
I can provide you with the basic procedures for the release of
the fund.
It does not matter whether you or your company does contract
project of the nature described here, the assumption is that you
won a major contract and subcontracted it to another company,
more often than not, big trading companies or individuals of
unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and
subcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution.
BENEFIT: For providing the account where we shall remit this
money, you will be entitled to 15% of the entire funds, 80% will
be for me and my partners, while 5% has been set aside to cover
any expenses that may be incurred by both parties during this
transaction, both local and international.
Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost degree
of maturity and confidentiality because I am still in active
government service with the "FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION". If I
receive your response on time, this whole transaction could be
accomplished within the shortest possible time based on your
interest and determination, since the money is already in
transit.
Please, try to reach me soon as there is no much time to waste on this .

DR AKIN DADA.URGENT ASSISTANCEDONATION FOR THE LORD.
From: Mrs Serena Jones
PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year
We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in Amsterderm Holland. Presently, this money is still with the Security  Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three
months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure  that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don’t have any child that will  inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don’t want my husband’s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don’t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband’s relatives around me always. I don’t want them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a chuch or christian individual for this  same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I  stated herein.  Hoping to hearing from you.
N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS NAME, THE LAWYER'S NUMBER IS 00-31-620-668-086.
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

MUTUAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
I am Dr. HASSAN DIKO,the chief accountant of The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in charge of contract award and payment approvals.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.
There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of
multinationals in the oil industry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among which were for the following:
1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a crude down stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation which cost $8bUSD(8 Billion United States Dollars).
2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States Dollars.
. The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.
The original value of these contracts were delebrately over invoiced in the sum $69mUSD (sixty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests were officially commissioned.
It does not matter whether your comapny did the contract or not, the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.
Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at this junction is
enormous.
In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between the parties in the course of the transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,the Nigerian officials.
Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms.
Our assurance is that your role is risk free,I accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund,the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the above mentioned amount.
Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security risk free.
Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 19 years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful to have my image and career deemed.
Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether you are interested in this deal or not, if you are not, it will enable us scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal but where you are interested send the required documents.
Send by Email for security reasons.
Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest co-operation.
Very truly yours,
Dr. HASSAN DIKO

My name is Mr.Oluwatobi E.Boye, the manager, credit and
foreign bills of Ecobank Plc.
I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who
perished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801]
with the whole passengers aboard on August 6, 1997.
Since the demise of this our customer, I personally
has watched with keen interest to see the next of
kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come
to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million
five hundred thousand united states dollars] which
has been with my branch for a very long time.
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall
be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to
be the next of kin and the banking ethics here does
not allow such money to stay more than Six years,
because money will be recalled to the bank treasury
as unclaimed after this period. In view of this I
got your contact through a trade journal after
realizing that your name and country is similar to
the deceased. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon
the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax
or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the
next step to take.
I will not fail to bring to your
notice that this business is hitch free and that you
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for

days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to
the deceased. When you receive this letter. Kindly Call me on my private telephone number at:234-80-5507-1652

PRAISE GOD, THE MOST BENEVOLENT.
I am Mrs. Victoria Bucknor,named person from Nigeria. I am married to Late Mr. George Bucknor of blessed memory who worked with Nigeria embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in the year 2000.
We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both very devoted christain.Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5Million (Five Million U.S. Dollars) in a security company. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three  months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a church/organisation or devoted christain individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here- in. I want this church/organisation or individual to use this money in all sincererity to
fund building church,orphanages,widows and also propagating the word of GOD and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy
bible.
The holy bible emphasized so much on GOD benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step. I took this decision because I  don’t have any child that will inherit this money, and I don’t want my husband’s hard earned money to be misused by people I call unbelievers. I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with GOD the most benevolent and the most merciful. I don’t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also of the presence of my husband’s relatives around me always.
I don’t want them to know about this development. With GOD all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply, I will forward it to my family attorney and I will then instruct him to give you the contact of the
Security Company. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the christains/Muslims communities where you reside to always pray for me.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted christain worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve the GOD must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church/organisation or a devoted christain for this same purpose.
Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders.

FROM  DUKE
Greeting,
This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person
nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know
somebody either in physical or through correspondence.
I got your contact through some discreet inquire from the chamber of
commerce and industry,you and your company were revealed as being quite
astute in private entreprenuership.one has no doubt in your ability to
handle a financial business transaction.
However, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty,WIWA DUKE and the
traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of
Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 20,000,000.00
(twenty million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late
father the money was accumulated from royalties rapid to my father as
compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil
presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of
livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But
before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged
some funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary
status. The lodgment Security Code Number
was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable
business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a
lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this
is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money
from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment
purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the
funds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your
choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had
intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is
his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when
due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I
will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss
physically on Investment potentials.
Based on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20%
of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may
arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The
balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family.
I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not
drug money and it is not money from arms deal.
Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this
matter. I will give you
all proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully
satisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the
beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.

PRINCE DUKEIntroduction.
Dear friend, 
I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu 
Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic 
of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this 
letter. This was in confidence considering my present 
circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my 
husband and two of our sons Joseph and Basher out of 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Cote 
d'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later 
moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later 
died of cancer disease. 
However, due to this situation we decided to change 
most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in 
Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of 
money coded for safe purpose because the new head of 
state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement 
with the Swiss government and other European countries 
to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in 
some european countries. Hence, my children and I 
decided laying low in Africa to study the situation 
till when things gets better. Like now that 
president Kabila is dead and the son taking over 
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in 
Southern France was confiscated by the french 
government, and as such I had to change my identity so 
that my investment will not be traced and confiscated. 
I have deposited the sum Fourteen Million United State 
Dollars (US$14,000,000,00.) With a security company 
for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate 
your interest that you can assist us in receiving the 
money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my 
son (Joseph) who has the out modalities for the claim 
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing 
this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. 
I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and 
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in 
other safe and non-speculative investments as advise 
by your good self. 
May I at this point emphasize the high level of 
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands, 
and hope you will not betray the trust and 
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if 
you want to assist us, my son (Joseph) shall divulge 
to you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where 
the funds are currently being maintained and also 
discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason 
kindly furnish us your contact information,that is 
your personal telephone and fax number for validation 
purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the 
above email address.

Dear Sir/Madam,
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
Greetings,
This letter may come to you as a surprise but I plead
with you to patiently read through it before making a
decision whether to assist me or not.
I wish to solicit for your assistance in this
transaction, which I strongly believe, will be of
mutual benefit to both of us.
My name is DAVIS TUTU, a branch manger of a
leading bank in South Africa (ABSA Bank), my
colleagues and I wish to seek your assistance in the
transfer of some huge sum of money (USD$35M) into a
foreign bank account.
An American national deposited this money in a fixed
deposit account in the bank, six years ago. The length
of time for the maturity of the fixed deposit was five
years, which expired towards the ending of last year.
Incidentally, MR. JEFF STEVENS, who was the
beneficiary died in the September 11th bombing of the
World Trade Center in America, and he left MR DAVID
STEVENS as the Next-of-kin to claim this money, but
unfortunately he was said to have died of cancer few months after
Jeff's death. All efforts made to trace any known
relations of both proved abortive, and no one has
written our bank in this regard.
All modalities for the successful transfer of this
money into an offshore bank account have been put in
place and we are looking for a trust worthy foreign
partner into whose bank account this fund would be
remitted to and it is in this regard that my
colleagues have mandated me to provide a partner who
will assist us. We have agreed to compensate you with
20% of the total amount if you should accept to assist
If you are interested in giving us the required
assistance, kindly reply this letter stating your
Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because of
the secrecy surrounding this transaction, I suggest
that you send a fax me or call and i will contact you
for futher details.
I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you

Dear Sir,
May this reach you in peace of mind and good health. It will be pertinent to first make myself known to you, my name is Mr. Sam Koroma. I am the first son of Chief Omoh Koroma, the former Chairman of Sierra Leone Mining Corporation.
Unfortunately, my father was brutally murdered in 1999 by the RUF rebels led by Mr. Forde Sankoh "the monster" who due to his selfish interest destroyed a nation and devastated the land because of the diamonds. This is a story that has to be imagined than to express because of the ugly memory and cost.
Since the demise of my father, we the entire family has been grieving and honestly, very hard for us to trust people especially here in Africa. I had only confided in few close friends as we were in need of securing the wealth of my father. It was within these meditation that I got your contact through a reliable source. Honestly I have not reveal this to anyone.
Based on this, I decided to write you first because this is my family last hope of living comfortably as we do when my father was alive. Before my father passed away, he had already acquired a vast estate and a considerable wealth in Sierra Leone.  In our neighboring country, my father deposited two boxes containing cash of thirty-three Million Dollars (US$33,000,000.00) in a security company. When he deposited this boxes, my father purposely registered it as a precious item in order not to attract the attention of the security company officers, and also for safety reasons until he is ready to use it for investments.
Unfortunately, as an adage says, Man propose but God disposes my father could not live to achieve all his dreams. In his declaration, he use my name as the next of kin. As the war broke out, we shifted to Johannesburg, South Africa for the safety of our dear lives. Right now, I am writing you from Johannesburg, looking for a way to remove the money out of the security company with a reliable person overseas for a proper investment. We cannot establish any businesses here in Africa due to instability of Government in most countries. Base on this, I am seriously soliciting on your kind assistance to aid me on how to invest this money with you in your good country. When my beloved country was in war, I was still a student and I had a little or no knowledge about business, this is one of the reason I need your help most. Please this is a family affair and because of my family name, it should be strictly between you and myself, and for safety!
of my mother and my younger ones.
Have this in your mind, this business is 100% risk free. My family have agreed to give you (15%) of the total amount if you are ready to assist us in this transaction. Your soonest reply will be much appreciated.
Kind regards,
Sam Koroma , for the family.CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE

FROM: MRS RAMA IDRIS
In Lordship. I am the above named person from Tunisia
but now undergoing medical treatment.
I was married to Dr.Roberts IDRIS who worked with
Malaysia embassy in ABIDJAN
for nine years, before he died in the year 2002. We
were both married for
eleven years without children.
He died after a brief illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his
death we were both Christians and since his death I
decided not to re-marry.
When my late husband was alive he deposited
the sum of USD5,500,000.00 (Five Million Five Hundred
Thousand United
States Dollars) with a  African Devlopment bank
I will send you details as
soon as you indicate your interest.
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for
the next Six months
due to my cancer illness. Having known my condition
and believing the doctor I have decided to donate
this fund to avoid total loss to church, Less
privilege,
or better still a Christian individual that
will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct
herein.
I want interested church or individual that will
receive and use this money to help churches,
orphanages ,widows and propagating the Gospel and to
ensure that the house
of God is maintained.
Please do not fail to spread the funds across the
globe
especially AFRICA as soon as you receive the money.
The Bible made us to understand
that it is more
blessed to give than to receive. I took this decision
because I don't have
any child that will inherit this money and my husband
relatives are fighting
over the properties and I don't want my husband's hard
earned money to be
misused by their greedy attitude. I don't want a
situation where this money
will be used in an UNGODLY manner, hence the reason
for taking this bold
decision. I am not afraid of death since I am a good
christian. I know
that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case
and I shall hold my
peace. I don't need any telephone communication in
this regard because of my
health, and because of the presence of my husband's
relatives around me
always. I don't want them to know about this
development. With God all
things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I
shall give you the
contact information of the bank
and other details that will enable you claim
the funds.please i want you to be aware that according to my attorney
there are some important document that will be required by the bank for the transfer this is where i will need your little assistance before the fund can be transfer with the help of my attorney.
I will also issue you a letter of authority/Power of
Attorney that will make you the beneficiary
of this fund. I want you to always pray for me
because the lord is my
shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a
worthy
Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must
serve him in spirit and
truth. Please always be prayerful all through your
life.
I sent you this mail under severe pains. Any delay in
your reply will be detrimental.
Please assure me that you will
act accordingly.
Hoping to hear from you immediately.
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,

impeached from office by a backed uprising of mass

in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption,
embezzlement, and the mysterious charge of plunder

The present government is forcing my husband out of

my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I
realized some reasonable amount of money from various

My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do
it secretly for now. before my husband was impeached,
I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000
million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) out
of Philippines and deposited the money with a security
firm that transports valuable goods and consignments
through diplomatic means.
I am contacting you because I want you to go to the

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT
I am DR H.B OHAMS,one of the very many accountants of The Nigeria 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in charge of
contract award and payment approvals.
There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of multinationals in the oil ndustry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
The original value of some contracts done for my corperation were delebrately over invoiced for OUR own use in the sum $29mUSD (twenty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the
companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests
were officially commissioned.
It does not matter whether your company did the contract or not, the assumption
is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other ompanies.
Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of onduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names.
WAITING FOR YOUR RESPONSE.THERE AND THEN I WILL GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS.

FROM Williams Ghazi,
JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.
TELL:+27-732112866.
Dear sir,
I am MR, Williams Ghazi, the son of late
MR.PATRICK Ghazi, who was murdered in a land dispute
in ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for
reliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidential
financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My
late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich
farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the
ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his
alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition
party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South
Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars
($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he
knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was
deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much
dumourage from the security firm.
This money was earmarked for the purchase of new
machinery and chemicals for the farms and the
establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.
This land probl!
em arose
when President R. MUGABE
introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the
White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently
condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the
government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob
actions. I and my family who are currently staying in South
Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided
to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the
Trunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher
transfer of the money to a foreign country where we
can invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of
claiming/investing this amount of money in South
Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in
future since both countries have the same political
history. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does
not allow such investment hence I am seeking for
an asylum or refugee.
I must let you know that this business is 100% risk
free and the nature of your business does not
necess!
matter. So if you are willing to assist us
claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have
agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will be
for a joint business venture I will be doing with you
and another 35% will be for me and my family which we
shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%
will be mapped out for all expenses we may incure
during the transaction.
Therefor, if you are willing and interested to render
the needed assistance. Please funish me your private phone and Fax 
number 
for easy and better communication.
Remember that this is highly confidential and the
success of this business depends on how secret it is kept.
Expecting your reply soonest.
Best Regard.

The Palace of King of Ogoni Kingdom, Ogoni Oil producing community, Rivers State Nigeria. Dear Sir, I am Princess IFEOMA , daughter of HRH King Solomon Abonime, the king of Ogoni Kingdom. I am 25 years old and studying Mass Communication. My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil producing area in Nigeria. He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in Nigeria. After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late dictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered stroke and died in NOVEMBER27th LAST year. But before his death, he called me and told me he has One Hundred and Five Million  United States Dollars   (USD105,000,000.00) cash in his possession, specially deposited in a Bank . He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he married. My moth!
er did not bear any male child for him. Which implies that all my father’s properties, companies e.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child according to African Tradition. My father therefore secretly gave me all the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that tradtionally, if he dies we cannnot get anything, as inheritance. He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and that I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male children who happen to be my elders. I am soliciting for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I will live with my mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will invest the balance money overseas, possibly on products of your company and other profitable ventures. I believe that by the special grace of !
God, you will help us move this money out of the {BANK} to y!

try where we can invest this money judiciously with you. You are entitled to a reasonable part of this money based on our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us. PLease reply through my e-mail Looking forward to hear from you as soon as possible.

Dear Sir,
Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that
this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat
it serious. I am Dr. Muhammad Khalil Hasan, a banker
with the GuarantY Trust Bank Nigeria Plc.  I am the
Accounts officer of late Mr. Robert Chapman the
African Area Director of SIL International, who
unfortunately died in the crash of Kenya Airways
Flight 431 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, January 30 2000.
Mr. Chapman was from Hamilton, Ontario Canada.
Since the death of Chapman, I as his accounts officer
in the bank, have made several enquiries to locate his
only surviving relation, without any success. I came
across your name and contact, on the course of my
personal searching for Chapman's relations, so I
decided to contact you for this project.
I am contacting you to assist in repatriating and
securing the wealth left behind in a fixed deposit
account by Robert, before they get confiscated or
declared unserviceable by my bank. The board of my
bank, has issued a notice that after 2 months from now
and no next of kin shown up for the claim, the funds
will be confiscated and declared unserviceable. Since
I and my team have been unsuccessful in locating
Robert's relatives for sometime now, I seek your
consent to present you as the Next of Kin of the
deceased since you are a foreigner, so that the
proceed of this deposit valued at Seven million five hundred thousand 
dollars can be released to you.
The bank will release the funds to any foreigner who
has all related information/documents to the bank
account. I am in charge of this matter in my bank,
because I am his accounts officer. Your application
will be directed to my department for verification and
approval. Everything is under my control.   
I shall provide you all the information and copy of
the certificate of deposit issued to Robert when he
deposited the funds. I shall also involve a good
attorney who shall represent you in all the
appropriate offices for the claim. Please, find in the
attachment my work ID Card. This is just to proof to
you that my proposal is genuine. I also have all
necessary information we need for the claim and once
the money is transferred to you, I shall destroy all
the documents used for the claim and leave no traces.
After everything, you shall have Fourty percent of the total
sum,while sixty percent for me.
All requires is your honest cooperation to enable us
see this business successful. I guarantee that this
will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that
will protect you from any breach of the law. Robert
was a very good man and it is not wise to allow his
hard earned wealth to be stolen by the greedy
directors of my bank.
Further details awaits your response by email. PLEASE,
TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET. Please, confirm the
receipt of my Id Card in the attachment, as it was
difficult to attach.

My name is Thomas Chilunda, from the Republic of Angola. I am writing you 
with trust and
confidential. And I got your contact through the internet  and it is my 
humble decision to
solicit for your understand and cooperation in this business that will 
benefit you and I.At the
mid term of the rebellion which is still on till date, my father, thinking 
fast, decided to send
my brother and I out of the country (Angola),  with a total sum of (US$82M), 
Eighty Two
million United States Dollars only.This money was meant for the purchase of 
arms and
ammunitions for the rebel, packed In a diplomatic baggage.On arrival in 
Madrid, Spain, we
discovered  that as political asylum seekers, we are not allowed to operate 
bank accounts.
And With the instruction of my father,
we deposited the baggage in a security company. This is without declaring 
the contents to
them. Unfortunately, because of my father's political influence,he was 
assassinated. We
therefore need your assistance by coming to Madrid, to open a non-resident 
bank account
with any of the local banks.
The non-resident account will enable the onward telegraphic transfer of the 
funds to your
nominated bank account. The whole arrangement will be strictly under our 
supervision and
the transaction will be absolutely risk free. The transaction will not last 
for more than three
working days, from the day of  your arrival.We intend to share the money 
upon successful
completion of the  transaction as follows:- 25% will be entitled to you for 
your assistance,
while 75% will be for us. Should this meet your utmost consideration, kindly 
contact us on telephone number +34-676-301-39  The confidentiality of the 
transaction cannot be over emphasized as we trust and believe that you will 
oblige us the security and attention it demands.Thank you  very much.

DEAR SIR/MADAM
Greetings. I know you will be surprised to read from

Congo(formerly known as
Zaire).
My husband Dr.TABITA CAMARA was the minister of
Precious Mineral
Marketing Co-Operation of the Democratic Republic of
Congo during the reign
of late president mobutu.As the wife he relied on, he
drew my
attention to the money in case of death or other
unforeseen
circumstance
This his fear was actualized when rebels attack and
burnt our house and
killed him.
Before the death of my husband he reveal to me where
he deposited$9.5 million US dollar,deposited in a west African
Country Ghana.
I and my son Henrry,have since been rescued by the
intervention of the
(U.N) peace keeping force, and have manage to escape
to the Republic of Ghana with my son. And we are now
presently taking
refugee in a refugee camp here in Ghana.
The money was kept in a box and registered as precious
items and thus nobody knows that the content it's

ADDRESS:NORTH ZONE BAZRA IRAQ.
ALTERNATIVE E-MAIL:(khalifa_rasheedfatima@yahoo.com )
Please permit me your little endulgence to solicit for your unreserved attention, based on my urgly condition of life though one with almighty Allah is with majority.
I am Mrs Fatima R. Khalifa, a widow to Late Sheik Mohammed Rasheed Khalifa.
I am 64 years old of a born muslim faith. Presently i am suffering from long time cancer of the breast, from all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I won't live more than six months according to my doctor,because the cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage.
My late husband was killed during the invasion of collition forces from American and Britain in Iraq,unfortunately he died leaving behind a huge sim of money in the vault of a private security company oversea to be precise in Holland, but due to
my present bad condition of health as I am suffering from Cancer of the breast its quite impossible for me to travel that distance to receive this money.
To this effect I have writen a letter throgh my family lawyer requseting for the transfer of this box to Dubai United Arab Emirates pending when I can succeed in getting a trust and
reliable person to utilize this money. Although, today, I have a signal from Dubai notifying me of the arrival of the consignment in their security costody.
I want you to understand that a neither have any son nor have any person to entrust this money to which I know that it is better make use of a total foreigner to achieve my aim.
Atleast had it been that during the period of our marriage we could produce any child, my late husband was very wealthy and after his death, his offspring will inherited all his business and
wealth.I got your contact through a desperate and personal search on the web, for someoneI could really trust and I have prayed over it.
Therefore my desire now is to contribute this wealth to the propagation of islam and in assisting the less-privileged Muslim faithful in Africa,Asia,Europe and in all Arab-Nation's .
I have discussed this with my Family Lawyer hence I am willing to donate the sum of US$16,250,00000. (sixteen Million two hundred and fifty thousand US Dollars)for the development of the holy
work of islam, as well as distribution's to aid muslim's faithfuls.
Please I want you to note that, this fund is lying in a Security Company in United Arab Emirate (UAE).
For that, my lawyer will file application's that will back you up for the transfer of the money in your name as the beneficiary only if you promise to use this funds judiciary for
the said purpose.
Therefore,I have decided to set-aside 40% for the promotion of holy islam and the work of Allah.
while 30% will be retuned back to me through my lawyer so that I can offset my bills in the hospital because of the cancer treatment.
If you have to die says the Allah, keep fit and I will give you the crown of life.
May the Grace of Allah be our guide and be my refuge when i leave this
world.
Moreso,I further decided to offer you 20% While the remaining 10%
is for the expenses incured during the facillitation of the fund.
PLEASE REPLY khalifa_rasheedfatima@yahoo.com
Yours in Allah,
Mrs Fatima Rasheed KhalifaMy name is John paul, a member of Independent Committee of 
Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility 
of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss 
indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. 
It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's 
Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by 
non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World 
War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.
The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons 
(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant 
accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.
The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including 
interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit 
boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. 
Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that 
were interest bearing when established.
The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims 
on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE 
with a credit balance of 35,000,000 US dollar plus  accumulated interest 
was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust 
era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. 
The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all 
unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing 
credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by 
the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died 
interstate (living no wills).
Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary 
contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be 
banked in the Cayman Island, being a tax free, safe haven for funds and 
we can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.
Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim 
the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your 
details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim 
documents for transfer of the funds to you.
Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I 
will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a 
secure, numbered account in your name in the Cayman Island, of which you 
will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to 
your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 
percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO 
RISK INVOLVED.
You can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the 
internet at the following websites:

The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting 
submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement.
I find myself priviledged to have this information and this may be a 
great opportunity for a life time of success without risks.

JohnDearest friend
Dearest friend
From: Mrs. Juliana Faith Peters
Bless the children of God.
I am the above named person but now undergoing medical
treatment now. I am married to Dr.Alan George Peters
who worked with south africa embassy in nigeria for
nine years before he died in the year 2001.
We were married for eleven years without a child. He
died after a brief illness that lasted for only four
days. Before his death we were both born again
Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry
or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the
Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he
deposited the sum of$27.6Million (twenty-seven Million
six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with one
finance/security company in Europe.
Presently, this money is still with the Security
Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not
last for the next three months due to cancer problem.
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.
Having known my condition I decided to donate this
fund to church or better still a christian individual
that will utilize this money the way I am going to
instruct here in. I want a church or individual that
will use this to fund churches, orphanages and widows
propagating the word of God and to ensure that the
house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to
understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don?t have any child
that will inherit this money and my husband relatives
are not Christians and I don?t want my husband?s hard
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don?t
want a situation where this money will be used in an
ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking this bold
decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where
I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bossom
of the Lord.
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case
and I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone
communication in this regard because of my health,and
because of the presence of my husband?s relatives
around me always. I don?t want them to know about this
development. With God all things are possible. As soon
as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact
of the Finance/Security Company Europe. I will also
issue you a letter of authority that will empower you
as the original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you
and the church to always pray for me because the lord
is my shephard. My happiness is that I lived a life of
a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the
Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always
be prayerful all through your
life.
Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing
for a church or christian individual for this same
purpose. Please assure me that you will act
accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from
please reply me through this email;
<mrsjfpeters@postmaster.co.uk>
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs Juliana faith peters.

In my quest for a reliable and reputable person to engage in a mutual business relationship,
I got your email through my retune search for a suitable preson that can help me in my predicament. And I  sincerely apologies for my contacting you in this form please bear with me.  And accept my indecent introduction, it was bore out of my despiration to get off my inadequcy to takle my immediate problems.
As a matter of introduction, I am the only surviving daughter of late Chief Ibrahim Sessey Cola, the paramount chief of Munsh District of Sierra Leone who was killed on  8th January  1999, by the trigger happy rebels. Most unfortunately
for me I came  from a polygamous family, and a student but out of school because of this problem.
During my father's lifetime he was actively engaged in ILLEGAL MINING AND SALES OF
DIAMOND, from where he made his enormous wealth.
Prior to my father's death, he left a WILL with his lawyer, which was made available to us upon
observation and conclusion of his burial. And as the only daughter most of his
properties were willed to me, most importantly is the sum of US$35M (thirty five million United States
dollars)which he deposited in a private security company in Europe which is also among my inheritance from my
deceased father.
I obviously know that it might be very difficult for you to believe my story but it is what is really happing to me now for
upon introduction of this WILL all my father's relatives have not been at peace with me, they were
not happy how my father assigned all the enormous wealth to me. As a poor girl, they have systematically and forcefully
collected from me all documents of the properties 'willed' to me. Not including a huge amount of money at ARE Bank of
sierra Leone which they could not withdrawn due to a court order restraining either party from making withdrawals pending the determination of a Litigation filled by my father's relations
challenging the WILL. Now since I am too hard for them{ the relatives) to subdue, they were making
attempts to kill me so that nobody can stop them from carrying out their act, as they have succeeded in
killing my mother last year. Infact the fear and warning of killing me has well griped me so much that I could
not bear it anymore, hence I ran away from our family house to live with a school mate of mine whose father
is a military man,with advise of my father*s lawyer to safeguard my life.
Considering my age and inexperienced in business and investment procedures, please I want you to help me
in  retreving this fund which I will use to  invest  in a profitable venture in a country where there is
Economic and political stability.  And if I may ask.......
1 .Is your country good for such investment???
Because I do not want to make mistake.
2 Can you help me???? without trying to double cross me
If you assent to help me in this regard, we shall then discuss what I will give you in return for your assistance. And before I disclose anything, we  will firstly have to sign a Memorandum of Understanding
upon which  you shall proceed to the official premises of the Security Company to take delivery of
the funds which I will use for  forfurther investment with your help or with the help of another person pending what comes out between us.
Please put into consideration my incapabilities in some respects, therefore I would prefer all correspondence
to be through Email which is more secret and confidential, as I can not use my school mate father's telephone
to avoid jeopardizing my staythere. Every document concerning these funds is with me, upon request I will sent it to you if need be. .
Should you not be willing to collaborate with me in this, please inform me urgently to enable me look
for another person. Or you email me at princesshasihatu@yahoo.com.hk.
Thanks in anticipation to your positive response.
Regards.

in ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for
reliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidential
financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My
late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich
farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the
ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his
alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition
party. Before the death of my father, he took me to
South
Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars
($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he
knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was
deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much
dumourage from the security firm.
This money was earmarked for the purchase of new
machinery and chemicals for the farms and the
establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.
This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE
introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the
White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently
condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the
government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob
actions. I and my family who are currently staying in
South
Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided
to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the

transfer of the money to a foreign country where we

Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in
future since both countries have the same political
history. Moreover, the South African monetary
policy/law does
not allow such investment hence I am seeking for

I must let you know that this business is 100% risk

claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have

MR.PATRICK SITHOLE, who was murdered in a land dispute
in ZIMBABWE.I got your contact during my search for
reliable&compitent foreigner to handle a confidential
financial transaction, then I decided to write you. My
late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich
farmers murdered in cold blood by the agent of the
ruling government of President ROBERT MUGABE for his
alleged support and sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition
party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South
Africa to deposit the sum of Twelve million US Dollars
($12m) with a security and finance company, as if he
knew the looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was
deposited as a gem/precious stone to avoid much
dumourage from the security firm.
This money was earmarked for the purchase of new
machinery and chem!
icals for
the farms and the
establishment of new farms in Lesotho and Swaziland.
This land problem arose when President R. MUGABE
introduced a new land Act. which wholly affects the
White rich farmers and some few blacks vehemently
condemned the 'MODUS OPERANDI' adopted by the
government. This resulted to rampant killing and mob
actions. I and my family who are currently staying in South
Africa as refugees or asylum seekers have decided
to enter your name as foreigner/beneficiary of the
Trunck Cases containing the Cash (USD12M) for futher
transfer of the money to a foreign country where we
can invest it. I am faced with the dilemma of
claiming/investing this amount of money in South
Africa for fear of encountering the same experience in
future since both countries have the same political
history. Moreover, the South African monetary policy/law does
not allow such investment hence I am seeking for
an asylum or refugee.
I must le!

free and the nature of your business does not
necessary matter. So if you are willing to assist us
claim the ownership of this money,I and my family have
agreed to give you 20% of the total money, 40% will be
for a joint business venture I will be doing with you
and another 35% will be for me and my family which we
shall also invest in your country and the remaining 5%
will be mapped out for all expenses we may incure
during the transaction.

the needed assistance. Please funish me your private phone and Fax

Ikoyi, Lagos
Contact: Mr Chris Ogiemwonyi – Group General Manager
Email: chris4120@k.ro
I am Mr Chris Ogiemwonyi a member of the Presidential
Payment Verification Committee (PPVC) of the Federal
Government Of Nigeria, West Africa and also a Director
of Project Implementation with the NNPC. I am
presently on assignment with my colleagues in the
ministry of finance and the presidency carrying out
routine verification of contractual claims on behalf
of the NNPC
I apologize for using this medium to reach you for a
Transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is
due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on
this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want to
count on you, as a respected and honest person to
handle this transaction with sincerity, trust and
confidentiality.
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation
with you in the process of actualizing our dreams
described hereunder. For the benefit of all parties
and hope you will keep it in confidence because of the
nature of this transaction within the NNPC and
Ministry of Finance (FMF), where I work as Director of
Project Implementation.
With the cooperation of four other top officials, we
have in our possession overdue payment bills which we
are presently verifying, to the tune of Twenty Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars
(US$26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with
the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our
behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to
receive such funds.
More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as
the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to
operate offshore account hence your importance in the
whole transaction.
This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total
contract value executed on behalf of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) by a foreign
contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
deliberately in the course of our verification
exercise. Though the actual contract cost have been
paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance
in the tune of the said amount which we have in
principle gotten approval to remit by Key Tested
Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank
account you will provide by filing in an application
to NNPC and the Ministry of Finance for the transfer
of Rights and Privileges to the contractual sum to
you/your account.
I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in the
transaction, your share of the sum would be 30% of
the $26.5million, 60% for us. The business itself is
100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with
utmost secrecy and confidentiality.
Your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the
successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
would not disappoint me.
Should you be interested or not in this transaction,
please notify me through this private
email: chris4120@k.ro or to call me with the tel number
above. If not also let us know, so as to enable us
enough time to scout for another credible foreign
partner or not to help carry out this transaction.
I assure you that my partners and I are in a position
to make the payment of this claim possible provided
you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee
that our share would be secured and please always
remember to treat this matter with the utmost
confidentiality, as any form of exposure would
compromise our positions in this government, being
active Government Civil Servants.
Once again, remember time is of great essence in this
transaction.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours faithfully,
Mr Chris Ogiemwonyi.FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION

Much Regards,
Patrika Kovac. (Mrs)>From The Desk Of,
Dr Harry Obum{Deputy Secretary Nigeria Football Association}Please Reply To My Private And Security Email Address: harryobum001@asiamail.com
Dear Sir,
I am DR HARRY OBUM , Deputy secretary to the Nigerian Football Association, parent body of the World Youths Championship, Nigeria 99'Local Organizing Committee, an affiliate of Federation of International Football Association (FIFA).
In the course of our preparation to host the World Youth Soccer Championship Tagged (Nig99) early last four years, huge sum of money running into millions of United States Dollars was budgeted by the then Military Government for the successful organization of this competition.
In the same vein, FIFA via its President, Mr. Joseph (SEPP) Blatter, made millions of dollars available for the same project, not to talk of Corporate Organizations and Football loving individuals who made huge donations.
However, in my capacity as the deputy secretary, to both the Local Organizing Committee (LOC), and the Nigerian Football Association(NFA), I,along with two of my colleagues in sensitive positions were able to over-invoice most contracts, which were awarded for the construction and the refurbishing of the 8 stadia used for the competition. The contractors who handled these projects have been paid-off.
It is pertinent to note that a total sum of thirty-two million United States Dollars(US$32,000,000.00) was realized as over-invoice after the successful completion of the project. This over-invoiced sum is lying in my organization's (NFA) suspense account with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), ready for transfer into the beneficiarys account oversea, waiting for the appropriate opportunity to do so. In this years (2003) budget speech, the new Civilian President has ordered that all foreign contractors debts should be paid in order to boost more Foreign investors into Nigeria. On this note, I have been unanimously mandated by my two colleagues to seek an honest and trustworthy Foreigner who will assist in ensuring the successful transfer of the above sum into a personal/company account since the Nigerian code of conduct does not allow us (Civil servants) to operate foreign accounts.
It is pertinent also to let you know that 30% of the total fund will be for you, while 10% will be used to settle any expenses that might be incurred by both parties and the remaining 60% will be for us (my colleagues and I) to be invested in your country. We have chosen you /your company to benefit with us in this transaction due to the respect your country commands here.
These are the necessary requirements we needed from you to complete this transaction:
1. Your bank Name, contact address and your account number where the money will be remitted.
2.Your bank telex, fax and telephone numbers.
3.Your personal phone/fax numbers for easy communication.
The above-mentioned particulars will be used to write LETTER OF CLAIM on behalf of your company from my ministry as the beneficiary of the fund.
You might be surprised and curious of an offer like this, be rest assured that the modalities and logistics towards the successful transfer of this fund has been worked out. All we require from you is your co-operation. This transaction is risk free.
We kindly request that you accord it the highest level of secrecy it deserves. Email:harryobum001@asiamail.com for security reason.
Your swift response will be highly appreciated.

Rep Of South Africa. 
Dear Sir/Madam, 
I am Mr.D Dumas. a consulting auditor of prime banks here
in South  Africa. I have the courage to Crave indulgence
for this important  business believing that you will never
let me down either now or in the  future.
Some year ago, an American Mining consultant/ contractor
with the South African Mining corporation, made a numbered
time (fixed)deposit for   twelve calendar months, valued
$142M.USD (ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO   MILLION US DOLLARS)
in an account. On maturity, The bank sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month, The bank sent another reminder and finally
his contract employers, the South African Mining
corporation wrote to inform the bank that he died without
MAKING A WILL, and all attempts by the American Embassy to
trace  his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore, made
further investigation  and discovered that the beneficiary
was an immigrant from Jamaica and only  recently obtained
American citizenship. He did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents, including his
Bank deposit paper work. 
This money total amount$142M.USD (ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO
MILLION US DOLLARS)is still sitting in my bank as dormant
Account.No one will ever come forward to claim it, and
according to South African banking  policy, after some
years, the money will revert to the ownership of the  South
African Government if the account owner is certified dead.
This is  the situation, and my proposal is that I am
looking for a foreigner who  will stand in as the next of
kin to beneficiary, and OPEN a Bank Account  abroad to
facilitate the transfer of this money.This is simple, all
you  have to do is to OPEN an account anywhere in the world
and send me its  detail for me to arrange the proper money
transfer paperwork, and  facilitate the transfer.The money
will then be paid into this Account for us  to share in the
ratio of 60% for me, 30 % for you and 10% for expenses
that might come up during transfer process. There is no
risk at all, and  all the paper work for this transaction
will be done by me using my  position and connections in
the banks in South Africa.
This business transaction is guaranteed.And the first phase
of the transfer will be ($42M.USD)  FORTY TWO MILLION
DOLLARS as advised by our insider in the bank.If you are
interested, please reply immediately through my personal
email sending the following details:

ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO
Dear Sir,
I am Dr. Ekiyoh Martins a native of Cape Town in South
Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the
South African department of Mining and Natural Resources.
Please accept my apology for using this medium to
convey a transaction/business of this magnitude, but
this is due to the confidentiality and prompt access
reposed on this medium. I have decided to
seek your co-operation in the execution of this deal
described hereunder, for the benefit of all parties
and hoping you will keep it as TOP SECRET because
of the nature of the business.
Within the department of Mining and Natural
Resources (where I work as a director), and with the
cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our
possession as overdue payment bills totaling Fourty Five Million,
Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$45,500,000.00)
which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance
and cooperation of a company/or an individual to
receive the said funds, via a reliable Bank Account.
Quite frankly, we are handicapped as the South
African civil service laws (Code of Conduct Bureau) strongly
prohibits us from owning/or operating a foreign
account hence your importance in this
whole transaction.
This amount (US$45.5M) represents the balance of the
total value of a contract executed on behalf of my
department by a foreign contracting firm which we
the officials (involved) deliberately over-invoiced.
Though the actual cost have been paid to the
original contractor leaving the balance in the tune of the
said amount which we have in principle gotten approval to
remit by Key Tested Telegraphic transfer (K.T.T.) to
any foreign bank account you will provide by filing
an application through the justice ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges
of the former contractor to you.
I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us i
this transaction by way of providing the required
account in receiving these funds, your share of the
entire sum will be 30% amounting to Us$13.65Million
of the US$45.5Million, 60% amounting to US$27.3Million
for us and 10% amounting to US$4.55Million will be
used to settle taxation and other miscellaneous
expenses in the course of transferring the funds to your account.
The business itself is 100% foolproof
and safe, as long as you maintain utmost secrecy and
confidentiality. Further more your area of
specialization will not be a hindrance to the
successful completion of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not
disappoint me. Should you be willing to assist
positively with a common goal, endeavor to contact
me immediately through my above email address.
If you are not interested, please also indicate so
that it will enable me to contact other foreign
partner with recommendations to carry out this deal.
I want to assure you that my colleagues and I are in
position to make the payment of this claim possible
provided that you can give us a very concrete
assurance of the safety of our share. Please, always
treat this matter with utmost confidentiality,
because we will not comprehend any form of exposure as we
are still in active government service. Time is of
essence in this business, so kindly act fast.
I await in anticipation your fullest co-operation.
Yours Faithfully,
DR. EKIYOH MARTINS.URGENT ASISSTENCE NEEDED

I know that this proposal letter might be a surprise to you, but do consider it as an emergency. In a nutshell,I am Mr.SAMSON K MANI,from the republic of Sierra-Leone in west Africa,now seeking political asylum in Dakar Senegal under the (UNHCR).I got your contact from a reliable chamber of commerce.
My (late )father (Dr.MUSTAPHA MANI) was the managing director of Rainbow Gold Diamond Mining company in (KEN EMA) Sierra- Leone.But was killed during the longing civil war and all his properties was totally destroyed.However, we managed to escape with some of my father's precious Diamonds which is presently deposited safely in a security and finance company here in Dakar.
Now we are saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy foreign personality to help us transfer the diamonds over to his country pending my arrival to meet with him.Furthermore,we only want this done this way because your country is politically stable for any profitable investment and if you accept our proposal,you will serve as the beneficiary of the diamonds.
I am giving you the offers as mentioned with every confidence on your acceptance to assist us,we have decided to give you 10% out of the total money generated from the sales of the diamonds.Secondly,we shall mapped out 2% for any miscellaneous expenses that you may incur during the transferring of the diamonds over to your country. Finally,the diamond weight in question is 42.550 Carats.Conclusively,i wish you send me a reply immediately as soon as you receive this proposal, so that we shall arrange on how to lift this consignment out of Dakar Senegal to your country.
On commencement,this transaction will take (7) working days to be accomplished.A certificate of ownership, and the Lab-test result certificate of the diamonds would be fax to you immediately i receive your urgent and positive reply.Until then,i remain with the best regards.
