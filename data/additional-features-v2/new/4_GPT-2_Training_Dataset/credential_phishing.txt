Attn:President/Ceo. 
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION, 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY). 
I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry 
as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to 
seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction 
which is of mutual benefit. 
I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and 
Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporatio(NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign 
firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the 
tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The 
over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the 
project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense 
Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to 
provide for us. 
SHARE: - 
For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you 
will be entitled to 30% of the money,60% will be for me andmy 
partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover 
any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this 
transfer,both locally and international expenses. 
I would require the following: - 
. Your company's name,address,telephone and fax numbers. 
The above information would be used to make formal applications as a 
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer 
to your account. 
It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects 
of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company 
won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. 
More often than not,big trading companies or firms of unrelated 
fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms 
for execution of such contracts. 
We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank 
of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no 
doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get 
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. 
Therefore,when the business is successfully concluded we shall 
through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the 
concerned Government Ministries for 100% security. 
We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once 
in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be 
transferred to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present 
Democratic Government start Auditing all Federal Government owned 
Parastatals. 
Please contact me immediately through my telephone number whether or 
not you are interested in this deal.If you are not,it will enable me 
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. Butwhere 
you are interested,send the required documents aforementioned herein 
through my above telephone number,or 
email:edema_ma@mauimail.com,because time is of the essence in this 
business. 
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. 
Yours faithfully, 
Edema Martins.

Dear Sir/Madam 
ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATE 
I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates 
or landed properties in your country on behalf of the 
Director of Contracts and Finance Allocations of the 
Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria. 
Considering his very strategic and influential 
position, he would want the transaction to be as 
strictly confidential as possible. He further wants 
his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, 
untill the completion of the transaction. Hence our 
desire to have an overseas agent. 
I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would 
agree to act as our overseas agent in order to 
actualize this transaction. 
The deal, in brief, is that the funds with which we 
intend to carry out our proposed investments in your 
country is presently in a coded account at the 
Nigerian Apex Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria) 
and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to 
your country in a convenient bank account that will be 
provided by you before we can put the funds 
into use in your country. For this, you shall be 
considered to have executed a contract for the Federal 
Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria for which 
payment should be effected to you by the Ministry, The 
contract sum of which shall run into US$27.4 Million, 
of which your share shall be 25% and 5% for expenses if you agree to be 
our overseas agent. 
As soon as payment is effected, and the amount 
mentioned above is successfully transferred into your 
account, we intend to use our own share in acquiring 
some estates abroad. For this too you shall also serve as our agent. 
In the light of this, I would like you to forward to 
me the following information: 
1. Your company name and address if any 
2. Your personal fax number 
3. Your personal telephone number for easy 
communication. 
You are requested to communicate your acceptance of 
this proposal through my above stated email address 
after which we shall discuss in details the modalities 
for seeing this transaction through. 
Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank 
you in anticipation of your cooperation. 
Yours faithfully, 
DR. JAMES ALBERT can you assit us ?

PROPOSAL FOR TRANSFER OF TWENTY MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS  (US$20.5M) TO YOUR ACCOUNT.
Your contact address got to me via export promotions council, your reliability and trustworthiness in business transaction was the main conviction that compelled me to solicit for your support in this deal. I am the Financial Controller of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Lagos, Nigeria and Secretary to the Contract Award Committee of my Ministry.
In collaboration with my colleagues, we have agreed to transfer out of the Country through Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) some amount and we will later reinvest it abroad after the success of this transaction. The amount involved is Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$20,500,000.00). This is as a result of over inflated amount of a contract. The contract has been already executed and the original contractor had collected his full and final payment. In as much as this contract was awarded to a Foreign Contractor and the payment in dollars, we now need a Foreign firm that will present itself as the contractor for this amount of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars (US$20,500,000.00) and then the fund will be transferred into your account.
Since we do not want to use the original contractor in applying for the payment, because the Contractor is not aware of this over-invoiced sum. Therefore, I as the Financial Controller was told to write you by my colleagues and see the success of the remittance immediately, you will however, be required to furnish us with these necessary informations.
1. Your personal phone and fax number for easy communication 2. Name and Address of your Bank, Phone, Fax and Telex numbers 3. Your Account number where this money will be lodged into and the Beneficiary's name. It could be personal or corporate. These information will enable us put APPLICATION OF CLAIM for the release of this money from concerned Government Agencies and it will last for ten working days. For your assistance we have agreed that the fund will be shared as follows:
You as the Account Owner 20%, Miscellaneous Expenses 5%, Officials Involved 75%
Now, we assure you that all arrangements have been concluded for the success of this transaction, so if you are interested, reply us STRICTLY THROUGH this e-mail or Alternatively through the above contact.

This mail sent through MailService.MS -> http://www.MailService.ms Request For Transfer Assistance
FROM: DR. OBOH LUIS (alternative email
address:rimomoh1@hknetmail.com).
Compliments of the season. I would like to firstly send to
you the best wishes of good health and success in your
pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in
this letter. Before going into details of my proposal to
you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost
confidentiality, as this is required for its success.
My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal
Government of Nigeria,s Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who
are interested in diverting some funds that are presently
floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your
assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated
account the said floating funds. We are determined to
conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of
2003. The source of the funds is as follows: During the
last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set
up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were
grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and
parastatals. The present civilian government set up the
contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the
instruments of payments made available to it by the decree
setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if
necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.
My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of
these funds which are presently floating in the Central
Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to
divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue
of our positions as civil servants and members of this
panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the
names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have
therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my
colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas
partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of
U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred
thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this
letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into
your account, if you agree with our proposition as
follows; (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for
us (the panel officials (iii)10% to be used in settling
all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the
actualization of this project.
We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project
in foreign stock markets and other business till we are
ready and able to have access to them without raising any
eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is
100% safe and risk-free. We
Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking
days from the date of receipt of the following information
through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name,
Company’s name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the
account number into which the funds should be paid. The
above information will enable us write letters of claim and
job description respectively. This way, we will use your
company’s name to apply for the payment and backdate the
award of the contract to your company. We are looking
forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit
for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my
direct Telephone number 234 8033064962 and my America
Internet Fax number 1 92896 27169
It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will
bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction
when I hear from you.

Pretoria, South Africa.
On behalf of my colleagues and I, I write this letter with great pleasure. Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black
Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a business transaction hereunder for the benefit of all parties.
Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.
The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced to the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.
The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has continued to encourage
investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included our bills for approvals with the
co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).
We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate a foreign account. The changing of beneficiary\'s information/details and other forms of
documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your good self.
I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so incurred.
It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other companies.
More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.
This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.
Kindly notify me by email for further details, upon your acceptance of this proposal.

PLEASE I REQUEST FOR YOUR GENUINE ASSISTANCE
I want to first solicit your confidence in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. We
shall be counting on your ability and reliability to prosecute a
transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business transaction
requiring maximum confidence. 
We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who
are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds which
are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to commence this business we
solicit our assistance to enable us RECEIVE the said trapped funds ABROAD. 
The source of this fund is as follows : During the regime of our late
head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha,the government Officials set up companies 
and awarded themselves contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in
various Ministries. The NEW CIVILIAN Government set up a Contract Review
Panel (C.R.P) and we have identified a lot of inflated contract funds
which are presently floating in the Bank. 
However, due to our position as civil servants and members of this
panel,we cannot acquire this money in our names.
I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of 
the panel to look for an Overseas partner INTO whose ACCOUNT the sum of
US$15,600,000.00(Fifteen Million Six Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars) WILL BE PAID BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER. Hence we are writing you
this letter. 
We have agreed to share the money thus: 
70% for us (the officials)
20% for the FOREIGN PARTNER (you) 
10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses. 
It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation
business.Please note that this transaction is 100% safe in all it's
ramifications and we hope that the funds arrive your account in latest
ten (10) banking days from the date of reciept of the following
information by email: A suitable name and bank account into which the
funds can be paid. Your confidential telephone and fax numbers for essay
communication. 
The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job
description respectively. This way we will use your company's name to
apply for payments and re-award the contract in your name/company name.We 
are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your
confidentiality in this transaction. 
For security reasons and in order to move forward quickly,please respond
to me by Tel:234 1 776 0870,Internet Fax:1 309 216 0222,so I can bring
you into the complete picture of this pending project and provide more
information as to the succcessful conclusion of this project. The best
response however,would be by telephone, so we can discuss fully all
issues needed to complete this venture in good time,and successfully.
Thank you and God bless. 
Yours Faithfully

Dear sir,
This business will be of interest to you and your business and
involves $30,000,000.00, which emanated from over invoiced contracts executed
on behalf of my ministry of minerals and Energy, by foreign contractor.
Though the actual contract value has been paid to the original
contractor,GUILDER MINING (PTY) SA, now in-liquidation. We have however included
our billforthe over invoiced amount of US$30m amongst the present bills
that are scheduled for payment in the name of the company in-liquidation.
We have also planned the execution of this deal perfectly both in the area of
documentation and the changing of beneficiary from the company in
liquidation that we had used to apply for payment, to the name, which
you will forward to us. I shall supply you with all the relevant documents
relating to this transaction as soon as we establish a working
relationship. For purpose of clarity, we are four in number here who are
strategically placed in the Department of Minerals and Energy for the smooth and

fourteen working days if you follow my instructions carefully and we work
closely as a team.  Where you are going to come in is this. We are going to

so as to legalize your company as the bona fide beneficiary of the contract
sum. In this regard we will do the incorporation of your company here and
reflect your company as having taken over the assets of Guilder Mining (pty).
Once we complete this process, your company will now be legally entitled
to the US$30m, which the Department of Minerals and Energy owes GUILDER
MINING (PTY) SA. We will thereafter use your company's name to apply for the
payment Meanwhile, please send me your confidential telephone/fax numbers, to

 Dear sir,
This business will be of interest to you and your business and involves $30,000,000.00, which emanated from over invoiced contracts executed on behalf of my ministry of minerals and Energy, by foreign contractor.
Though the actual contract value has been paid to the original contractor, GUILDER MINING (PTY) SA, now in-liquidation. We have however included our billforthe over invoiced amount of US$30m amongst the present bills that are scheduled for payment in the name of the company in-liquidation. We have also planned the execution of this deal perfectly both in the area of documentation and the changing of beneficiary from the company in liquidation that we had used to apply for payment, to the name, which you will forward to us. I shall supply you with all the relevant documents relating to this transaction as soon as we establish a working relationship.
. This transaction is itself risk free and should be concluded within the next ten to fourteen working days if you follow my instructions carefully and we work closely as a team. . Where you are going to come in is this. We are going to effect a change of company name from GUILDER MINING (PTY) SA to your company so as to legalize your company as the bona fide beneficiary of the contract sum. In this regard we will do the incorporation of your company here and reflect your company as having taken over the assets of Guilder Mining (pty). Once we complete this process, your company will now be legally entitled to the US$30m, which the Department of Minerals and Energy owes GUILDER MINING (PTY) SA. We will thereafter use your company's name to apply for the payment of the US$30m into your company's designated account. This application we will process here in my Ministry and the approved Payment Recommendation sent to the Ministry of Finance, whi!
ch will authorize the South African Reserve Bank to effect the transfer of the fund to your designated account. For assisting us with a receiving account and a company name, we propose 20% of the contract amount of US$30m for you and 10% for taxes, phone, fax and other incidental expenses that we may incur in the course of the eventual realization of the transaction.
Meanwhile, please send me your confidential telephone/fax numbers, to
enable us to speak first and know ourselves better. You can also contact me on my confidential sat phone-00+871763427855 fax-00+871763427856. I promise that you will not regret helping us, you have my personal word of honor. My colleagues and I strive for the commitment to operate only on high standards of integrity and honesty. We need the same honesty and commitment to this transaction from you.
Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.
My Sincere Regards.

Dear Sir/Madam
I am an Engineer with the South African Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources and I am also a member of the Republic of South Africa Contract
Award and Monitoring Commitee in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources. It is a pleasure involving you in this project. Although, this
may sound strange but I seek your indulgence and pray you view it seriously.
Two years ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources by my committee. This contract was over
invoiced to the tune of US$14.3Million. This was done delibrately. The over
invoicing was a deal by my commitee to benefit from the project. We now
desire to transfer this money which is in a suspense account with the MEMR
into any oversea account which we expect you to provide for us.
For providing the account where we shall remit the money, you will be
entitled to 30% of the money, 10%  will be set aside for expenses incurred
by both parties during course of transfer, while the remaining 60%will be
for my partners and myself.
I would require the following:
1)Bank details ( Name and address / Account no/Beneficiary name )
2)Private Telephone and Fax number of Beneficiary
The above information would be used to make formal application as a matter
of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your
account. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract
projects of this of this nature described here, the assumption is that your
company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies.
More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields
win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution
of such contracts. We have strong and reliable connections, top government
contacts at the South Africa Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance and we
have no doubt that all this money will be released and transferred if we get
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the
business is successfully concluded we shall through our connection withdraw
all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100%
security. We are civil servants and we will not want to miss this
opportunity.
Please contact me immediately through my above Telephone or email contact,
whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will
enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. But
where you are interested, send the required informations aforementioned
herein without delay as time is of essence in this business.
I want to assure you once again that this transaction is 100% risk free
both now and in the future.
I await in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours faithfully,

ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATES.
Dear sir,
I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of works and Housing in Nigeria. Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the completion of the transaction.Hence our desire to have an overseas agent.
I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction. The deal in brief is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use. For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent. Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction, all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us . As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use o!
ur own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as our agent . It might interest you to note that last year, a similar transaction was carried out with one MR. CHIENCHEN YU of Taiwan but after securing the payment approvals, and payment effected, MR.CHIENCHEN YU changed his numbers and addresses, and was no where to be found on our getting to Taiwan.
That was how we lost US$7.5Million. So this time around , I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to avoid future occurrence and allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen. You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal, through email.
After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through. If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindly destroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and
interest of the personalities involved.
Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.
Best Regards,
Dr.Bola Harry.

I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client before it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this deposit was lodged.
Particularly the finance company where he has a Bank account deposit
with credit balance $15 million dollars ( Fifteen million dollars ) have issued me a notice to provide the next of kin.
I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin so that the proceeds of this account valued at $15 million dollars can be paid to you  and then we can share the money. 50% to me and they Bank officers who will assist to accomplish it successfully while 45%
to you. Then the balance of 5% will be reserved for incidental expences.
I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up this transaction. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I am very sure with your trust and asistance, we will successfully and legally transfer this money to you before the Bank Management take any decision about it.
As an experience lawyer, I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will  protect you from any breach of the law as we have also arranged to immediately close the account immediately after the transfer.
Please get in touch with me through my email as stated below and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss further about this transaction.
I hereby attach the CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT as his trustee and sole administrator of his estate  and also the current statement of his already dormant Bank Account with  Union Bank Finance securities which my client operated before the unfortunate incident with a fixed deposit Balance of $15M. Also attached is a form for next of kin for you to fill carefully and append your signature then return by email attachment or fax.
Please contact me immediately through my email: princewilliamson@portugalmail.com
Note however, that your nature of business,sex or country of origin will not be a hindrance to the transfering of this money.
Best regards, and peace be with you.
Please if you want clarification or my personal photograph and international passport and driving licence, I will be happy to provide it provided you will not betray my trust and confidence in you and that you will provide yours too.

Investment proposal from:
Dr. Tunde Cole.
Block 4 Federal Secretariat Complex,
#16 Norman Williams Way.
Ikoyi-Lagos
ATTENTION:
REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
I am Dr. Tunde Cole the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of USD$31,500,000.00 (thirty one million five hundred thousand united state Dollars).
This amount has been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say,
the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for Incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course.
Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord this transaction the legality It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bona- fide beneficiary. Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having
my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by responding to this email so that I can brief you further. I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the second quarter payments for the 2003 financial year.
Thanks and God bless.

Dear Sir,
My name is Mr.EVANS PETER, I work in the credit andaccounts
department of Union Bank of Nigeria
Plc,Lagos, Nigeria.
I write you in respect of a foreign customer with
Domicilliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is
Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among
those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during
the reign of late General Sani Abacha.
Sir,since the demise of this our customer, EngineerJoseph
Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor,I have kept a
close watch of the deposit records andaccounts and since
then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next
of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his
a/c and the
a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the
code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands
now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed
information other than my very self considering my position
in the bank.
Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim
the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co
operation in using your name as the 
next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a
foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself
and you. At this point I am the only one with the
information because I have removed the deposit file from the
safe .
By this doing, what is required of you is to send an
application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to
the late Engineer.
I will need your full name and address, company or
residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with
next of kin column in the certificate of deposit.
Finally i want you to understand that the request for a
foreigner as the next of kin is occassioned by the fact that
the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a
local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me,
then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between

Dear Sir,
RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
I am CHIEF(DR.)BODE GEORGE., Chairman to the Contract Review
Panel that was recently inaugurated by the President of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria to review the activities of past military government with
particular reference to contracts awarded by all ministries between 1990
to 1999. In the course of carrying out our assigned duties, we discovered
the sum of USD40.5 (forty million, five hundred thousand dollars) only lying
idle in a suspense account with our apex bank. This funds emanated from
grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate of foreign firms
by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation. On completion of our assignment, this amount was
deliberately not included in our report because we want to capitalize on
this once in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it.
The only option we have to achieve our aims and objective is to have this
fund transferred to a country of our choice where it can be kept in trust
and safe custody for us. We are however handicapped at the moment by
our status as civil servants, which barred us from operating foreign
accounts while still in government service.
Thus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce,
you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private
entrepreneurship. On this premise, we have no doubt in your ability to
handle a business of this nature, which informed our desire and wish to
enter into a partnership with you. This business involves the remittance of
this amount into your bank account with the hope of travelling down to
meet you physically in order to receive our share. We hope to invest some
in profitable ventures in your country based on your advise while the
balance will be repatriated home as foreign earnings. We have mapped
out strategies and all paperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success.
The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in
the world over, bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world
countries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for
execution. That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those that
executed one of such projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-
invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has
been paid. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free as there
is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future for we are well
connected in official circle. Given our level of commitment at the moment,
we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part, the objective
of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of
two weeks. It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the
transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum, 75% will be for
my colleagues and I.
If you are interested in this proposal, please call or send me an e-mail
VIA:bode_george@xuppa.com for more clarifications. If however
you are not interested, still let me know to enable me search for someone
else to carry out this business with.
I anticipate a timely response from you.

I am a serving officer with the custom and exercise

international airport we confiscated some boxes
that came into the country from china and on
opening we discovered that it was genuine dollar
notes well packed with lace materials, as honest
and dedicated officers we handed over these
seized boxes to the government, After further
investigation we discovered that these boxes were
brought in by some retired generals and
disgruntled politicians to truncate our political
dispensation, but to our surprise theses boxes
were handed over to them and money was used in
areas for the election. Then just recently before
the swearing in ceremony of our president we came
across another set of six boxes containing the
same items as officers we know that the same
process will be applied we now took two of these
boxes containing USD$ 60M(sixty Million Dollars)
which we have taken out of the country.
As serving officers we are not allowed to
operate foreign account or seen to be involved in
business of any kind so we therefore seek your
assistance to collect this money and invest it
for us to a time when we will be retired, if
this offer is acceptable to you we will
compensate you with certain percentage that will
be worked out by both parties and an agreement
will be drawn to protect both parties. kindly

Ikoyi-Lagos
REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
I am Dr.Kunle Owolo, the chairman of contract award and review committee set
up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to
handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts
executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of
the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original value of
these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
I am Dr.Kunle Owolo, the chairman of contract award and review committee set
up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to
handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts
executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of
the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original value of
these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of
USD$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state Dollars).
This amount has been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that
the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid
and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I

Dear Sir/Madam
First, I must solicit  your strictest confidence in
this transaction, this is by  virtue of it's nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret as you were
introduced to us in confidence through the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce, foreign trade division.
We are top officials from the Federal Ministry of
Works and Housing,(FMWH),Federal Ministry of Finance
and the Presidency, making up the Contract Review
Panel (CRP) set up by the Federal Government of
Nigeria to review contracts awarded by the past
military administration.
In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered
this fund which resulted from grossly over-invoiced
contracts  which were executed for theFMW&H during the
last administration. The companies that executed the
contracts have been duly paid and the contracts
commissioned leaving the sum of US$17.4 Million
floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of
Nigeria ready for payment.
I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by
my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas
partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$17.4M
legally subcontracting the entitlement to your
company. This is bearing in mind that our civil
service code of conduct forbids us from owning 
foreign company or running  foreign account while in
government service hence the need for an overseas
partner.
We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus
after it has been paid into your account:
(1) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the
beneficiary of the fund.
(2) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection
for reimbursment to both parties for incidental
expences that may be incurred in the course of the
transaction.
(3) 60% to us the government officials (with which we
wish to commence an importation business in
conjunction with you ).
All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction 
within ten to fourteen days of commencement after
receipt of the following information:  Your company
name, address, company's details & activities,
telephone & fax numbers.
These information will enable us make the applications
and lodge claims to the concerned ministries &
agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent
to state here that this transaction is entirely  based
on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque
drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria
correspondent bankers around the world is going to be
made in your name.
lease acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my

FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION. 
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of
my colleagues. I got your information from a personal search in the
internet business index. I have decided to seek a confidential 
co-operationwith you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of
parties, and hopeyou will keep it confidential because of the nature of
this business.
Within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources where I work
as a Director of Project Implementation, and with co-operation
of four other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue
payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage
of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a
foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
to the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost
has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance 
unclaimed. 
Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign
contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations
with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies.
As a result we included ours bills for approvals with the co-operation
of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve
Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance as
the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed
to operate a foreign account. 
I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that,
should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share
as compensation will be 25% while my colleagues and I receive 70%, and
the balance of 5% for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.
It does not matter whether or not your company does contract
projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that
your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other
companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms
of unrelated fields wins major contracts and subcontract to more
specialized firms for execution. 
I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my
e-mail address above,to indicate whether or not you are interested in this
deal. If
you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner
to carry out this deal.I want to assure you that my partners
and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim
possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured.It is important that
you treat this matter with utmost confidentiality as any form
of exposure will negatively affect us since we are still in active
Government Service. 
Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in
you and hope that you will not disappoint us. 
Kindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance
of this proposal.

Dear Partner,
Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani
Abacha the late former head of state of Nigeria in June
1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion,
frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian
administration, I have been subjected to physical and
psychological torture by the security agents in the country.
My son is still under detention arraigned before the federal
high court of Nigeria for an offernce he did not commit.
As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence
with anybody within the country.You must have heard over
the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various
huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different
security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up
their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged
there and many outrightly blackmail us. In fact the total
sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of
US$700.Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make
me poor for life. You may be surprise how I got to know but
I will tell you when you reply. I repose great confidence
in you hence my approach to you. due to security network
placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit
the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I
hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have
deposited the sum of U.S 40.3 million dollars with a security
firm abroad whose name is witheld for now until we open
communication.I shall be grateful if you could receive this
fund into your account for safe keeping. This arrangement is
known to you and my son alone, my son will deal directly with
you as security is up my whole being. The name of my son is
Mustapha. I am seriously considering tore-marry if you desire
as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start
all over again with you if you wish, but if don‘t want to
marry me just help me in diverting this fund into your
account which will accrue you 30% of this fund.
Please honesty is the watch word in this transaction.
Please forward your private your telephone and fax number
so that we can commence communication immediately.

I am George Ugo,The Chairman, Contract
Awardind Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST
AFRICAN STATES ( ECOWAS)with Headquarters in Lome,
Togo.I got your information in a business directory
from the Togolaise Chamber of Commerce and Industries
when I was searching for a reliable,honest and
trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was
simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact
from the many names and lists in the directory.
After discussing my view and your profile with my
colleagues,they were very much satisfied and deci! ded
to contact you immediately for this mutual business
relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of
USD9.5,000,000.00 (Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars only.)into your personal or
company`s bank account.

bills awarded by us for the supply of ammunitions,
hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/medical items,light
and heavy duty vehicles, apperals and other
administrative logistics etc for the ECOMOG in
Sierria-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping
Projects.
This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully
protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed
off.As the Chairman of CAC,I have the cooperation and
mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of
the Organisation.We arranged and over invoiced the
contract funds supplied by different companies from
different countries during the crisis. 
It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a
willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to
transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne
out of our beleif in the non-stable and sporous
political nature of this sub-region.
The original contractors have been duely paid by the
Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest
(Central Bank of the West African States)through our
bankers-Societe Generale Banque.This balance is
suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by
any foreign company of our choice.We intend to pay out
this fund NOW as the organisation is winding up its
activities since the aim of returning PEACE to the
countries and the coast has been achieved.
Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil
servants working under this organisation, are not
allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more
reason why we needed your assistance to provide an
account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping
and our future investment with your comprehensiv! e
advise,assistance and partnership in your country.
It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal
to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation,65%
will be held on trust for us while 5% will be used to
defray any incidental charges and cost during the
course of the transaction.
This transaction will be successfully concluded within
14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due
cooperation.You should provide the followings;

and approval with the texts will be sent to you for
confirmaton and then forwarded to the organisation for
ratification and subsequent payment.
As with the case of all organised (s! ensitive)and
conspired DEALS,we solicit for your unreserved
confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We
hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable
business life afterwards.There are no risks involved.

Dear Sir,
First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction.This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential 
and 'top secret'. 
You have been recommended by an associate who assured me in 
confidence of your ability and reliability  to prosecute a transaction of great 
magnitude involving a pending business transaction requiring maximum 
confidence.
We are top officials of the Federal Government  Contract Review Panel 
who are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds 
which are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to commence this 
business we solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your account 
the said trapped funds.      
The source of this fund is as follows: During the
last Military Regime here in Nigeria, the Government officials set up 
companies and awarded themselves contracts which were grossly over- 
invoiced in various  ministries.
The present government set up a Contract Review Panel and we have 
identified a lot of inflated contract funds which are presently floating in the 
Central Bank Of Nigeria ready for payment. However, by virtue of 
our position as civil servants and members of this
panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names.I have therefore, been 
delegated  by my other colleagues in the panel tolook for an overseas 
partner into whose account we would  transfer the sum of US
$21,500,000.00 [Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred thousand U.S Dollars.  
Hence we are writing you this letter.
We have agreed to share the money thus:
1. 20% for the account owner( you)
2. 70% for us [ Myself and other members of my panel ]
3. 10% to be used in settling taxation and all
local and foreign expenses direct or incidental to the execution of this 
transaction.
It is from the 70% that we wish to commence the importation 
business.Please, note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope to 
commence the transfer latest Ten (10) banking days from the date of the 
receipt 
of the following information,company's name, Address, Telephone and 
Fax number.
The above information will enable us write letters
of claim and job description respectively. This way we will use your 
company's name to apply for payment and re-award the contract in your 
company's name.
We are looking forward to doing this business with you and solicit your 
confidentiality in this transaction.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above Email 
address.
I will bring you into the complete picture of this pending project when I 
have heard from you.
Remember this is a Deal so treat with utmost
confidentiality.
Yours faithfully,

ATTN ,
It is my pleasure to write you after my seven days fasting and prayers and 
much consideration since I can not be able to see you face to face at first.
Being the first and the only Daughter of my father, late ALHAJI KALWA UBA from
BETE in Republic of COTE D´IVOIRE Africa I am 21years of age. My 
father was limited liability cocoa and gold merchant in ABIDJAN before his 
untimely death after his business trip to SWITZERLAND, to negotiate on a 
cocoa business. A week after he came back from SWISS, he was assassinated 
with my mother by unknown assassins. 
Which my mother died, instantly, but my father died after five days in 
hospital, on that faithful afternoon. I didn´t know that my father was 
going to leave me after I had lost my mother. But
before he gave up the ghost, it was as if he knew he was going to die. He 
my father, (may his soul rest in perfect peace) he disclose to me that he 
deposited the sum of $5 million U.S dollars in a PRIVATE BANK here in 
ABIDJAN. That the money was meant for his cocoa business he wanted to 
invest in Abidjan - Côte d´Ivoire. Though, according to my father he 
deposited the money in his own name . 
He single handed me over the document and logging and verifying 
informations , and instructed me to seek for a life time investment partner 
abroad. 
Now I have succeeded in locating the BANK in here and also confirmed the 
fund is in there , most honest and confidentiality. Now I am soliciting for 
your assistance to help me lift this money out from The BANK to your 
account abroad so that we should invest it in any lucrative business in 
your country. 
I am Waiting anxiously to hear from you so that we can discuss the 
modalities of this transaction, 
Thanks for your kind attention and mutual
understanding.
Best regards
ZAINAB. Dear Sir,
My names are  Mac  Johnson  Bonida, I am the inmediate
young brother to Mrs Jewel Charles Taylor of  war
tored country of Liberia-westAfrica, the wife of (Mr
Charles Taylor) president of Liberia.
After a peace deal in Ghana few weeks ago, my sister
called me for introduction of what need to be done
inmediately that her properties are no longer safe. He
asked me to meet her contact in Ivory Coast to arrange
my journey to Eruope. She said  that she had made
contact with a  Security company to move a truck box
containing $30,000,000.00 US Dollars,  Thirty  Million
United State Dollars Only, and that the security
company label the box which the funds are contained in
as a box containing Africa artifacts.
The Company has confirmed the arrival of  this
consignment in their  office in Netherlands.
I left for Ivory-Coast  for my journey to Europe and
at this moment I am in Netherlands but owing to what
is happening in my country this time, my sister can
not do nothing as to Claim the Consignment and she
want this deal to be a confidential transaction, so
she asked me to contact any partner  who could stand
as a beneficiary of this truck box, so that after the
beneficiary must have claimed the box the money will
be channeled into good business investments with low
risk.
She has agreed to give 10% of the total fund to you
for assistance and moving of the fund to your private
account in your country for the purpose of the
investment. While 5% of the total fund will cover your
expense during this transaction, and another 5% for
me. You can contact me if you are interested by my
e-mail address or kindly call me on this Netherlands
telephone number, .
I would be glad if you can help me out to complete
this transcation and transfer this fund into your
private account. Please endeavour to keep this
transaction as confidentail as much as possible
because my Sister and her husband is in trouble over
the war in my country-Liberia.

Subject:Request for Assistance!
Attn:Director,
I wish this my proposal will not come to you as a surprise. I am Dr.Faroq Uztaz, a Regional Director with Ghana Commercial Bank with regional office in Accra,Ghana. We had a foreign client (Mohamed Mohd Salaheldin)who deposited a huge sum of amount, US$8.5million(Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with our bank. Unfortunately,this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999in U.S.A. However, they were given a ceremonial mass burial near the crash site.Confirmable from the below websites:
www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html
www.fas.org/irp/news/1999/10/
www.ntsb.gov/events/EA990/default.htm
but, since then we have not had any body to come for the claims as the next of kin. A sitaution I have monitored closely with my position in the bank.
Now, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past four years , I have removed the file to my "private vault". I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting for a foreigner to enable me move the funds to his account. This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled by me and every loop holes sealed off.
I therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this deal. What you stand to gain(%)would be discussed and it is negotiable before the deal commences.
Believing to hear from you soonest.
Kind regards,
Dr.Faroq Uztaz.

BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$25.6 M (TWENTY-FIVE
MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) &
BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP
First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this
transaction,this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly
confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us in
confidence through the Nigerian Chamber of
Commerce, Foreign Trade Division.
I am Dr.Jeff Mboma, the Secretary of the Federal Government
of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee (CAMC) of
the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation [NNPC].Sometime ago, a contract was
awarded to a conglomerate of Foreign Companies
by my committee on behalf of NNPC, the contract was
over-invoiced to the tune of US $25.6 Million.This was done
deliberately, the over-invoicing was a deal by members of my
committee to benefit from the project, we now desire to
transfer the money, which is presently in a suspense account
of NNPC in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) into an
overseas account which we expect you to provide
We have agreed that the following funds will be shared thus
after it has been paid into your account;
a) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the
beneficiary of the fund.
b) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for
reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that
may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
c) 60% to us the government officials (which we wish to
commence an important business in conjunction with you).
I Would Require
a) Name and address of Company/ Beneficiary
b) Proforma Invoice / Letter-Head Paper
The above information would be used to make formal
applications as a matterof procedure for the release of the
money and onward transfer to your nominated account.
It does not matter whether or not your company or you does
contract projects of the nature described here, the
assumption is that you won a major contract and
subcontracted it out to other companies, more often than
not,big trading companies or individuals of unrelated field
win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized
firms for execution of such contracts.
We have strong and reliable connections and contacts at the
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and The Federal Ministry of
Finance and we have no doubts at all that this money will be
released and transferred if we get the necessary
foreign partners to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when
the business is successfully concluded we shall through the
same connections withdraw all documents used from all the
concerned government ministries for 100% security.
We want this money to be transferred to the foreign account
which you are going to provide bearing in mind that our
civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign
company or running foreign account, all
expenses regarding the account opening if not already in
existence shall be borne by you, all expenses are however
reimbursable as already stated above on conclusion of
business.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter if you are
interested.
I wait in anticipation of your co-operation.

Dear sir,
TRANSFER OF $26,948,500.00 ON ACCOUNT NUMBER 262 -866-5050
I am contacting you in the belief that you are a honest and trustworthy person.I hope you will not betray the confidence I have in you to have contacted you even though we've not met before.Besides,I only got your address from an internet listing.
I am Dr.Donald Ike,Head of Banking Operations,Eastern Banking Unit of one of the biggest banks in Africa.I will not mention the name of the bank I work for security reasons but promise to disclose it to you as soon as I am convinced that you are capable and willing to assist me with this transaction.I hope this does not turn you off anyway;I am only being cautious.
The account numbers mentioned above  belong to late Engr.Philip De Wulf,a Belgian who was the managing director of Energy Services International ESI,a petrol and oil servicing company .This company has been a household name in the downstream sector of my country for its professional service provision especially in the late 80s but after the death of Engr.Wulf everything began to take a rather retrogressive trend largely due to the inefficiency of his successor.I personally manage the accounts of this company as well as the personal account of Engr.P.D.Wulf .Shortly before his death in a ghastly motor accident which claimed his life and that of his newly married wife Mrs.Debra Wulf in 1993,I had received some receivables in the form of cheque payment on behalf of my esteemed customer,Engr.Wulf and since he instructed that all personal cheques be paid to his online account,I followed the instruction to the latter.However as a result of his death!
,this account remained unserviced for a long time neither was there any person named next of kin .The net balance of this account till date is One Hundred and Forty Eight Million,Nine Hundred and Forty Eight Thousand,Five Hundred United States Dollars($148,948,500.00).According to the Banking and Other Financial Act 1991 (as amended) of my country if such deposit is not claimed twelve years after the demise of the account holder,the Board of Directors should recommend to the Federal Authorites that efforts were actually made to establish the next - of -kin but due to non was specified by the deceased,that the Federal Government should inherit the account.The actual fact on ground is that the directors do not return such money to the Fedeal Authorities,instead they share and stach it in their foreign accounts amongst themselves.This should go far to explain why the bank is not making any effort in trying to locate any relation of this man fo!
r about a decade now but individual investigation conducted by myself
shows that there is no information about his relations mentioned in any of the account opening documents filed at the bank.
All I want you to do is to collaborate with me by standing in as the beneficiary because Management is ready to approve the remittance of the money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account.Beside I would use my position to facilitate prompt remittance of the fund.Send to me immediately the your business porofile as well as your bank account information of any bank of your choice where you want the money to be transfered.You may open a new account if you so wish.If for any reason you think you're incapable of this transaction, you may recommend anybody whose integrity is not in doubt. I shall however provide you with directives on what to do as we proceed.Contact me on my private telephone numbers above or through my email address with information about your full contact addresses including personal telephone & fax numbers and Bank information immediately if you are interested. As soon as I get this information and I am convinced that you a!
re capable to do this transaction,I will consult a probate lawyer on your behalf as the beneficiary for the drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the neccesary documents and letter of Probate/Administration in your favour so as to put you in better position as the beneficiary .Please you have to be eraborate in your profile to enable me make a good assessment about your desirability.I shall tell you the name of my bank soon after I am convinced of your personality.
I also need strong assurances from you to the effect that you can guarantee the safety of the money when it gets to your account.However,I want you to understand that as a man of strong character it beats my conscience that I have to do this deal for two strong reasons.Firstly ,to curtail the excesses of the directors and secondly to plan ahead of my retirement which is just few months from now.In view of this,you may be approached after the transfer to provide me with investment advice as I plan to invest the fund in any lucrative venture after retirement.
At the conclusion of this business, I shall travel to your country for sharing.I have mapped out 30% of the total amount for you for assisting me,5% to take care of all expenses from both party and the remaining for me.
I await information about you and look forward for prompt reply from you.
Warmest Regards.

THE CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT
AWARDING COMMITTEE
ECOWAS HEADQUATERS
ACCRA GHANA
WEST AFRICA.
I am Mr.Kazeem Ahmed,the Chairman of ECOWAS contract awarding committee in
ecowas sub-regional head quarter in Accra Ghana, West Africa. In due respect
regard, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be
very beneficial to both of us
at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in my
department,we discovered a huge sum of money that was over invoiced
amounting $35,000,000.00 and un-recorded for in the books of Accounts.We
discovered that it has been floating since 1997 through 2001 in
international
Bank of Africa Accra Ghana. this is found out to be over influence on
contract
payments and over invoice. Personally the information is kept secret by me
my partner to enable the whole plan and ideas profitable and successful
during
the time of execution. As it may interest you to know, I got your contact
through business inquires from the  chamber of commerce here in my country
was making contact for an honest foreigner who will assist me in this
transaction.
Meanwhile the whole arrangements to put claim over this fund, as a payment
contract executed since it cannot be withdrawn locally and get the required
approval and transfer this money to a foreign account
has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed
you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assits us and
also
benefit yourself in this great business
opportunity. In fact I could have done this alone but because of my position
this country as a civil servant we are not allowed to operate a foreign
account
and would eventually raise an eyebrow on my
side during the time of transfer. This is the actual reason why it will
require
a second party or fellow, who will forward claim as the
contractor and also present a foreign account where the money would be
tranferred to as a payment for contract executed as it may be after due
verification by designated board.  I would not fail to inform you that this
transaction is 100% risk-free. On smooth conclussion of this
transaction, you would be entitlled to 30% as gratification,while 5% will be
aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer
also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and
my partners.
Please, you have been advise to keep top-secret as we are still in service
intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
monitoring the whole situation here until you confirm the money in your
account,and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
according
to percentages.  All other necessary information will be sent to you when I
hear
from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish
this deal.
Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Kazeem Ahmed
CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT
AWARDING COMMITTEE.Dr. Usman ali
I am Dr. Usman ali, I am a former special
Adviser on Petroleum matters to the late Head of State
Of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha. Because of my strategic
Position in the former Government and also being a
Close confidant of the late Head of State.
I was able to acquire personally the sum of
$12,500,000.00 USD (Twelve Million, Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars only) presently lodged
In Security Company inform of Gold Bars in a security
company here in Nigeria. I did not want the management
of the Security Company to know the content of the
consignments; therefore I registered the content of
the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security
company believes that what I deposited with them was
Gold Bars
I made this money largely through "CONSULTANCY FEE"
And "Good Faith Fees" paid by foreign Oil companies
Prior to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other
Lifting/prospecting Rights (Nigeria is the 6th largest
Producer/Exporter of Crude Petroleum in the World.
As you are probably aware Nigeria is prone to Military
Coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability
has fueled hyper Inflation, amongst other problems.
I have therefore resolved to invest my money abroad,
preferable in Real Estate Properties and Importation
of Goods from your country for safety and optimum
returns on Investment.
However, straight transfer of this money into a bank
abroad will present two major problems one, the tax
incidence will be too high, as much as 60% of this
money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a
result of Government deliberate restrictions on flight
of capital Abroad. And also been accused of money
laundering
and terrorism, The solution is to Courier this money
cash abroad in form of consignment, through Courier
service Company here in Nigeria in
Conjunction with an embassy here in Nigeria, the money
will be packed in a "Diplomatic Bag/Carton" tagged
Diplomatic luggage that will be address to you.
This system is secret and the money is therefore
Untraceable. It is system used by most top Government
officials to remove their fortunes to safety abroad.
I have therefore concluded every arrangements with a
Courier Company in Nigeria to Courier this money
abroad using the courtesy and safety of Diplomatic
Bag. All I now need is an honest partner who can
receive the money on my behalf and help me to invest
as aforementioned. There is absolutely no risk
involved in this transaction as the money will be
delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills.
If you are interested in assisting me, please send to
me by email immediately your preferred contact address
where this money will be delivered to you, upon
delivery, you are to lodge this money in a bank
account and contact me for necessary arrangements for
the investment.
For your help and assistance in this deal, you will
receive 15% of this money in cash or Equity if you
wish to join the proposed company.
I have notified the Security Company where I deposited
the consignments that contained the fund, that I am
moving the consignment abroad and the security company
has since been waiting for my authority for the
consignment to leave my country and move to abroad.
So if you know that you will use this fund honestly as
I have instructed.
and the details will be given to you on how you will
be able to receive the fund in your country through
the security company. You should also forward to me
your telephone and fax number for easy communication
and to fax you the documents concerning the
consignments.
Your prompt response will be highly appreciated.
Best regards
Dr. Usman aliBUSINESS
: Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha.
I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha, from Kuwait. I am married to 
Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed 
memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine 
years before he died in the year 
2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died 
after a brief illness that lasted 
only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and 
I was a devoted Christian by 
birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my 
late husband was alive, he 
deposited the sum of $25.5million dollars (twenty five million, 
five hundred dollars), which he in
herited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an 
overseas finance and security firm. 
Presently, this money is still with finance and security firm. 
Recently, my doctor told me that I 
had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next 
four months. 
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either 
a Christian organization or a 
devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way 
I am going to instruct here in.
I want this Christian organization or individual to use this 
money in all sincerity to fund 
churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of God 
and to ensure that the society 
upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible 
emphasized so much on the giving 
of alms, charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold 
step. I took this decision 
because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives 
are all Muslims and I don't want 
my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call 
me an unbeliever.
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an 
unholy manner hence the reasons for 
taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with 
God the highest and the most 
merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will 
only give you the contact of my 
lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making 
you the beneficiary of the 
consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this 
letter and accept to assist me 
to conclude this transaction, if you want to speak with me he 
will arrange for that because my 
doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I 
can't discuss in the presence of
my husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the 
hospital, my lawyer is the only person 
that knows the decision that I am taking.
With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I 
receive your reply through my 
lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the 
beneficiary of the consignment and all 
necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall 
also give you the contact of the
finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of 
authority that will prove you as the 
original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian 
community where you reside to 
always pray for me. 
My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian 
though married to a Muslim, 
whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in 
spirit, please always be prayerful 
all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room 
in souring for another Christian
organization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose. 
Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your 
shoulders, may the Almighty God 
continue to guide and protect you. Amen.

I am the Director of project and the newly appointed chairman, contract reviewing committee(CRC) of the Federal ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H) in Lagos, Nigeria, I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US $17,000,000.00 into your account for mutual benefits. This money came about as a result of a contract executed on behalf of my Ministry, the (Federal Ministry of Works and Housing). This contract was officially assigned to be awarded and executed by two foreign contractors at the tune of US$80,500,000.00, but in the course of my negotiation, I bargained with only one foreign contractor, a Bulgarian firm which now executed the contract at the cost of US $63,500,000.00. Thus leaving the remaining US$17M to my benefits unknown to the contractor and any other person in my Ministry. 
This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing his payment from my Ministry.

Dear Sir,
Re: FIRST TRANSFER OF $6M [Six million] US DOLLAR
I am jubeeg venture, the operational manager in account management section incharge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who perished with his whole families on
25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ] with the whole passengers aboard. 
There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since his death , I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his company.
The total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[ One hundred and six million United States Dollar ]. We wish to start the first transfer with $6,000,000.00
[Six million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.
I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing
his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.
The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury as unclaimed after this long period of domancy. 
In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her personal account.At the conclussion of the
transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.
Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer
can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. 
When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail or you can call me or fax me VIA: 
FAX:(870} 763 648315. You should also include
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.

: Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha.
I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha, from Kuwait. I am married to 
Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed 
memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine 
years before he died in the year 
2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died 
after a brief illness that lasted 
only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and 
I was a devoted Christian by 
birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my 
late husband was alive, he 
deposited the sum of $25.5million dollars (twenty five million, 
five hundred dollars), which he in
herited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an 
overseas finance and security firm. 
Presently, this money is still with finance and security firm. 
Recently, my doctor told me that I 
had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next 
four months. 
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either 
a Christian organization or a 
devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way 
I am going to instruct here in.
I want this Christian organization or individual to use this 
money in all sincerity to fund 
churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of God 
and to ensure that the society 
upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible 
emphasized so much on the giving 
of alms, charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold 
step. I took this decision 
because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives 
are all Muslims and I don't want 
my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call 
me an unbeliever.
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an 
unholy manner hence the reasons for 
taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with 
God the highest and the most 
merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will 
only give you the contact of my 
lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making 
you the beneficiary of the 
consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this 
letter and accept to assist me 
to conclude this transaction, if you want to speak with me he 
will arrange for that because my 
doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I 
can't discuss in the presence of
my husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the 
hospital, my lawyer is the only person 
that knows the decision that I am taking.
With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I 
receive your reply through my 
lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the 
beneficiary of the consignment and all 
necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall 
also give you the contact of the
finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of 
authority that will prove you as the 
original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian 
community where you reside to 
always pray for me. 
My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian 
though married to a Muslim, 
whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in 
spirit, please always be prayerful 
all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room 
in souring for another Christian
organization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose. 
Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your 
shoulders, may the Almighty God 
continue to guide and protect you. Amen.

FROM:DR.PAUL BUGATI
Dear Sir, 
I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this letter.
Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost confidentiality as this is required for its success and to have faith in this transaction, for opportunities like this only comes to one once in a life time. 
My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of my country's Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Apex Bank of my country. In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2003
The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime in my country, government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.
My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds, which are presently floating in our (Apex) Central Bank, ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes.
However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in my country. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$20,500,000.00  (Twenty million, five hundred thousand U.S. dollars). That is why I am seeking your assistance. We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;
(i) 25% to the account owner (you). 
(ii) 65% for us (the panel officials). 
(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both 
you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.
We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other viable business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free.
We intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above: Your company's name, address, telephone and fax numbers; we will use your company’s name to  apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract in favour of your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction.
I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you. Please get in touch either through my email address above or my American internet FAX number 1 775 535 4598.TEL +234 1 775 7784

www.freeserve.com/anytimeCONTACT ME IMMEDIATLEY.
I am Mr. Usman Ramat Shehu, Manager with UNITED BANK FOR AFRICAN PLC(U.B.A.).I have a confidential business proposition for you. Our Bank is a 
financial institution specialising in private banking to individual customers who likes confidentiality in their financial dealings.I have intrest of investing in your company as such i would like to make contact with you for assistance.
On January 13,1987 an Indian-American mining consultant with the 
Petrogas Gas Systems BV Environmental Systems, Mr. Dixit Shanti made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for Twenty Four calendar months, valued at 
US$49,500,000.00 (Forty Nine million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in the Bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but 
got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from
his contract employers, that Mr. Dixit Shanti died in the 1988 Lockerbie 
flight Pan Am 103 plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he 
died intestate (without making a WILL), and all attempts to trace his 
next-of-kin had been fruitless.Please see
http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/5260/passlist.html
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Dixit 
Shanti did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents with
us, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$49,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to 
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Dixit Shanti.
This is simple, I will like you to provide your full names and home or
office including your telephone and fax numbers so that I can seek the
services of a lawyer/Attorney to prepare the necessary documents and
court affidavits which will put you in good standing as the 
next-of-kin.
A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide later 
will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the 
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the 
ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.
Be informed that in other to provide more legality and legitimacy to 
this project, the paperworks for this will be done by the Attorney and my 
position as the head of bills and exchange guarantees the successful execution 
of this transaction. If you are interested, please
revert back to me.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall 
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.If you are capable and intrested to do this business with me you reply me in this my email address: usmanramat1@web-mail.com.ar
Thanks and regards.

Attention:
It is my pleasure to contact you for assistance and
business co-operation. I know the content of this
letter might be surprising to you but I assure you
that every word of it is true. Even though we hardly
know each other I believe you can help me.
I am Dr. Rilwanu lukman,President Adviser on Petroleum
and Energy and Alternate Chairman of N.N.P.C
Board&also OPEC President Designate.My office monitors
the sales and lifting of crude oil and petroleum
product by foreign dealers. With the cooperation of my
assistant and head of the audit committee attached to
the task force, I have successfully saved about
US$37.5 million.
This money is as a result of allocation of excess
crude oil to the foreign dealers, which has been sold
but this money is not entered in the financial
statement of my task force. This money was lying
unclaimed in the account of the task force, known only
to me and the chief security officer in our ministry
who help me in
moving
the fund out through his security network and me
involved in the excess
allocation.
However, the legislators of the new democratic
Government of my country have set up a panel to look
into the past activities of some government companies
and parastatals. I do not want the panel to discover
the money I saved.
I cannot lodge this money into my private bank
account. In my country, public servants are not
permitted to operate any account in excess of $500,000
US Dollars. Now the idea is to have a foreign partner
whom the sum will be transferred to. I  have concluded
arrangement and transfered this money to a finance
company for safekeeping to avoid the government from
seizing this fund .
All you have to do is to give me  your private
address,
phone and fax lines and . I will
send you the details of the transfer and necessary
document as soon as you provide them.
If you can assist me transfer this money into your
nominated bank account,I will give you 20% of the
amount. You will keep the remaining sum for my wife
pending
her arrival to your country. We intend to invest 50%
of the sum in business. With your knowledge and past
experience your advice will be highly needed for the
investment. We would want to know the lucrative
business areas in your country we can invest on with
the 50% of the sum.
Don't worry about any problem in this business. I
assure it is safe and no risk is involved. No other
party is aware of the sum from the excess allocation
except my partner and me. However, this transaction
should be secret and confidential.
I awaits your reply on your participation or not, so
that I can search for another willing person. Your
quick response matters.
Best regards
Dr. Lukman Rilwanu[Nutch-general] PLEASE GET BACK TO ME.

FROM THE DESK OF
MR JERRY OZUBA
N N P C.
MUTUAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
I am Jerry.Ozuba,the chief accountant of The Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in charge of contract award and payment approvals.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.
There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of
multinationals in the oil industry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among which were for the following:
1. The expansion of the pipelines network within for a crude down stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation which cost $8bUSD(8 Billion United States Dollars).
2. Contract for the turn around maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States Dollars.
3. The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.
The original value of these contracts were delebrately over invoiced in the sum $69mUSD (sixty nine Million United States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred, being that the companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when the projests were officially commissioned.
It does not matter whether your comapny did the contract or not, the assumption is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies.
Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total  amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at this junction is
enormous.
In return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and
external) between the parties in the course of the transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,the Nigerian  officials.
Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the
above stated terms.
Our assurance is that your role is risk free,I accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the fund,the whole approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the above mentioned amount.
Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100% security risk free.
Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 19 years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful to have my image and career deemed.
Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether you are  interested in this deal or not, if you are not, it will enable us scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal but where you are interested send the required documents.

Dear Sir/ Madam,
Before I start, I must first apologize for this unsolicited mail to you. I am aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to starting a relationship but as time goes on you will realize the need for my action. I am Mr. Mark Zuba, a native of South Africa currently residing in Amsterdam, Netherlands for a management course, at the Hoge University. 
Allow me to explain my reason and importance of my writing to you. Sir I am requesting your assistance in order to redeem an investment made with the Southern Mining Corporations Limited, in which I am a senior executive.  The said investment now valued at Ten Million United States of American Dollars (U.S.$10,000.000.00) was purchased by Eric Reilly and contracted out to the Southern Mining Corporations Limited in September 1979.  This redeemable investment interest has now matured and has been cleared for disbursement since March of 2001. 
Since then, there has been an extensive global wide attempt to locate and notify any living relatives of Eric Reilly being that he himself died in December 1987.  We have confirmed through three independent search agencies that there are no living relatives in which whose favour the investment can be paid.  Being that two of my colleagues are also executives in the account department of the Mining Corporation, we have access to all Reilly's information, we can claim this money with you.  All we need to do is file this claim in your identity and effecting the necessary documentary changes, which lies in our respective departments and proclaim you as actual beneficiary of this investment. 
These funds can be paid into any designated account in which you provide in any given country.  My proposal to you is that for your assistance you will withhold 30% of the total sum while, ensuring that my partners and I receive the remaining 70%. 
I hope that you are able to understand the entire nature of my proposal. There is no risk involved in this transaction now or after the successful conclusion of it. As stated earlier, there are no living relatives to lay claims on these funds. Therefore this transaction is legal, however without your assistance this money will be returned over to the Southern Mining Corporations Limited as lost fund. 
Please for further question, feel free to contact me through this e-mail address: markzub@mail2world.com let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you. 
Best regards, 
Mark Zuba

http://www.vanguardngr.com/articles/2002/headline/f128122003.htmlBUSINESS PROPOSAL
FROM:Dr.RICHARD SHUBANE .
#123CB/PBV,MAIN CITY,
JO,BURG, SOUTH AFRICA.
Dear Sir, 
My name is Dr.RICHARD SHUBANE ,I am the operational
manager in account management section incharge of
credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks
here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a
foreign customer of my bank who perished with his
whole families on 25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH
[ Flight AF4590 ] with the whole passengers aboard.
There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by
this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a
written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since
his death , I personally has watched with keen
interest to see the next of kin but all has proved
abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no
other person knows about this account or anything
concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and
until his death he was the manager of his company.
The total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[ One
hundred and six million United States Dollar ]. We
wish to start the first transfer with
$6,000,000.00[Six million] and open successful
transaction without any disappointment from your side,
we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining
balance to your account.
I have secretly discussed this matter with the general
manager of the bank who I must involve in order to
have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to
any foreign bank account which you are going to
nominate. 
On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable
foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of
the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank
account where the fund will be transferred for
immediate investment on any viable project as no one
has come up to be the next of kin. 
The banking ethics here does not allow such money to
stay more than six years without claim hence the money
will be recalled to the government treasury as
unclaimed after this long period of domancy. In view
of this I got your contact through my personal search
to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank
account for the transfer or find a reliable person who
will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her
personal account.
At the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fund
will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total
transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in
your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside
to settle expenses both parties might incure during
the transfer process.
Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a
detailed information about the transaction.I will not
fail to bring to your notice that this business is
100% risk and trouble free and that you should not
entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer
can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you
apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from
the deceased. When you receive this letter.
Kindly send me an e-mail MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS~:
auditorotto2@netscape.net  You should also include
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe
communication.
Respectfully yours,
Dr.RICHARD SHUBANE

http://mail.yahoo.comMy name is John paul, a member of Independent Committee of 
Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility 
of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss 
indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. 
It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's 
Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by 
non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World 
War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.
The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons 
(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant 
accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.
The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including 
interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit 
boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. 
Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that 
were interest bearing when established.
The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims 
on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE 
with a credit balance of 35,000,000 US dollar plus  accumulated interest 
was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust 
era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. 
The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all 
unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing 
credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by 
the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died 
interstate (living no wills).
Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary 
contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be 
banked in the Cayman Island, being a tax free, safe haven for funds and 
we can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.
Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim 
the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your 
details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim 
documents for transfer of the funds to you.
Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I 
will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a 
secure, numbered account in your name in the Cayman Island, of which you 
will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to 
your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 
percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO 
RISK INVOLVED.

submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.
This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses.

rance to the successful execution of this transaction.
I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not 
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my secured email address richard_mboweni@rediffmail.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. 
If you are not, it will enable me contact other another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction.
Yours faithfully,
Dr. Richard MboweniReply Asap
Dear Sir, 
I know this message will come to you as a big surprise because we have not met before, but please do not think this is one of those junk emails you received in your email box this is for real. 
I am Rahim Sule I am the personal assistant to the late Mr. Alexander Murphy .my late boss Mr. Murphy spent all his live here in Lagos Nigeria. He is one of the richest contractors based in Nigeria before he died on 10th Jan 2000 together with his only daughter Kimberly in a motor accident. 
the reason I am telling you these is because since Mr. Murphy died, a lot of letters and faxes has been coming to me the personal assistant to inform the next of kin to the late Mr. Murphy for the collection of $15 million united states dollars (fifteen million united states dollars) which is his balance for the road construction contract he executed for the Nigerian government. 
But late Mr. Murphy has no next of kin; he died together with his only child Kimberly who is the next of kin. 
I lived with him for 20 good years and he lost his parents when he was a small boy. Mr. Murphy generation is finished. But nobody knows his history apart from me the personal assistant he told me everything about his life before he died. So this is what I want the both of us to do immediately, I will present you as the next of kin I have all documents and files of the late Mr. Murphy which will cover you up fully as the next of kin. 
The Contract Award Committee is waiting for me to inform the next of kin of late Mr. Murphy for him or her to contact the payment committee for them to release the $15 million United States dollars to the next of kin. 
Anybody I present as the next of kin the money will be given to the person joyfully with my approval. It is only I the personal assistant that can produce the next of kin. This is a quick and sweet business if only you will cooperate with me there is nothing to fear in this business since I am involved. 
The last letter the contract Award committee wrote to me yesterday was that if I cannot inform the next of kin, to contact them for the collection of the $15 million, that the funds will be sent into their government account and it will be used to purchase arms for their soldiers. 
I am just coming back from their office before writing you this letter; I told them that the next of kin will contact them very soon for the collection of fund. 
So I want the both of us to do this business together and collect the $15 million dollars when the fund is collected we must remove 10% of the total amount and give to charity homes then yourself and myself will now share the remaining equally 45% for you 45% for me. 
Please do not tell anybody what I just wrote to you for security reasons and for the safety of the business. 
Please if you will do this business with me send me your telephone number so that I can reach you. 
I wait to hear from you as soon as possible.

Attention:Sir Madam
My name is Mr Frank a member of Independent Committee of
Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.
It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's
Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by
non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.
The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons
(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant
accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.
The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including
interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit
boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.
Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that
were interest bearing when established.
The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims
on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE
with a credit balance of 50,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest
was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust
era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs.
The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all
unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills).
Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary
contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be
banked in a bank in  U.A.E Dubia or Spain or france, being a tax free country, where we can safely withdrew the funds and we can share the funds and use  it for investment of our choice.
Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds.
All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds to you.
Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax.
I will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a secure, numbered account in your name in an internet Bank , of which you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of  your choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED.

Mr Frank EzeCAN WE DO THIS TOGETHER.
Compliments of the day, 
My name is Paul Jacksoncole, I am a consulting auditor with one of the prime banks here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my client bank who perished with his whole families on 25TH JULY,2000 in 
CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with the whole passengers on board. 
During the course of my auditing work with my client bank, I discovered an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his death, I 
further investigated with keen interest to see if i can get any relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of his company. 
The total amount involved is $36,000,000.00 USD.[Thirty Six Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00[Ten million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment from your 
side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom I must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which 
would substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. 
On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasury 
as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable person who will be capable of 
receiving such amount in his or her personal account. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will 
be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process. 
Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information about the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund 
transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased. When you receive this letter. 
I look forward to your earliest reply through my private email address <mailto:mrp_jack@myway.com or pauljacksoncole@yahoo.com> and telephone number +874 763 593 620. Fax number +874 763 593 621.Just add your international dial out code number and you will get through.You should also include your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.

Dear,
I am Dr. Erick, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.
Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars, which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.
This amount (Twenty-Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.
I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours faithfully,
Dr. Erick

Dear sir,
TRANSFER OF $148,948,500.00 ON ACCOUNT NUMBER 262 -866-5050
I am contacting you in the belief that you are a honest and trustworthy person.I hope you will not betray the confidence I have in you to have contacted you even though we've not met before.Besides,I only got your address from an internet listing.I am Dr.Donald Ike,Head of Banking Operations,Eastern Banking Unit of one of the biggest banks in Africa.I will not mention the name of the bank I work for security reasons but promise to disclose it to you as soon as I am convinced that you are capable and willing to assist me with this transaction.I hope this does not turn you off anyway;I am only being cautious.
The account numbers mentioned above belong to late Engr.Philip De Wulf,a Belgian who was the managing director of Energy Services International ESI,a petrol and oil servicing company .This company has been a household name in the downstream s-ector of my country for its professional
service provision especially in the late 80s but after the death of Engr.Wulf everything began to take a rather retrogressive trend largely due to the inefficiency of his successor.
I personally manage the accounts of this company as well as the personal account of Engr.P.D.Wulf
.Shortly before his death in a ghastly motor accident which claimed his life and that of his newly married wife Mrs.Debra Wulf in 1993,I had received some receivables in the form of cheque payment on behalf of my esteemed customer,Engr.Wulf and since he instructed that all personal
cheques be paid to his online account,I followed the instruction to the latter.However as a result of his death,this account remained unserviced for a long time neither was there any person named next of kin .
The net balance of this account till date is One Hundred and Forty Eight Million,Nine Hundred and Forty Eight Thousand,Five Hundred United States Dollars($148,948,500.00).According to the Banking and Other Financial Act 1991 (as amended) of my country if such deposit is not claimed twelve years after the demise of the account holder,the Board of Directors should recommend to the Federal Authorites that efforts were actually made to establish the next - of -kin but due to non was specified by the deceased,that the Federal Government should inherit the account.The
actual fact on ground is that the directors do not return such money to the Fedeal
Authorities,instead they share and stach it in their foreign accounts amongst themselves.This should go far to explain why the bank is not making any effort in trying to locate any relation of this man for about a decade now but individual investigation conducted by myself shows that there is no information about his relations mentioned in any of the account opening documents filed at the bank.
All I want you to do is to collaborate with me by standing in as the beneficiary because Management is ready to approve the remittance of the money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account.Beside I would use my position to facilitate prompt remittance of the

curtail the excesses of the directors and secondly to plan ahead of my retirement which is just few months from now.In view of this,you may be approached after the transfer to provide me with investment advice as I plan to invest the fund in any lucrative venture after retirement.

We have not had any body coming for the claims as the next of kin. A
Situation I have monitored closely with my position in the Company. Now,
Having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before his

Year plus, I have removed the file to my private safe.
I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin
as every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only
Waiting for a foreigner to enable me move the fund to his account. I

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY).
I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction, which is of mutual benefit.
I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U.S. dollars. This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us.
SHARE: -
For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you will be entitled to 30% of the money, 60% will be for me and my partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this transfer, both locally and international expenses.
I would require the following: -
1. Your company's names, address telephones and fax numbers.
2. The bank where the money will be remitted to.
The above information would be used to make formal applications as a matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your account. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms for execution of such contracts.
We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100% security.
We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be transferred to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present Democratic Government starts auditing all Federal Government owned Parstatals.
Please contact me immediately through my private mailbox (tobi4120a@k.ro). If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. But where you are interested, send the required documents aforementioned herein through my above mailbox, as time is of the essence in this business.

Email: chris4120@primposta.com
I am Mr Chris Ogiemwonyi a member of the Presidential
Payment Verification Committee (PPVC) of the Federal
Government of Nigeria, West Africa and also a Director
of Project Implementation with the NNPC. I am
presently on assignment with my colleagues in the
ministry of finance and the presidency carrying out
routine verification of contractual claims on behalf
of the NNPC
I apologize for using this medium to reach you for a
Transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is
due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on
this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I want to
count on you, as a respected and honest person to
handle this transaction with sincerity, trust and
confidentiality.
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation
with you in the process of actualising our dreams
described hereunder. For the benefit of all parties
and hope you will keep it in confidence because of the
nature of this transaction within the NNPC and
Ministry of Finance (FMF), where I work as Director of
Project Implementation.
With the cooperation of four other top officials, we
have in our possession overdue payment bills which we
are presently verifying, to the tune of Twenty Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars
(US$26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with
the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our
behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to
receive such funds.
More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as
the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to
operate offshore account hence your importance in the
whole transaction.
This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total
contract value executed on behalf of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) by a foreign
contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
deliberately in the course of our verification
exercise. Though the actual contract cost have been
paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance
in the tune of the said amount which we have in
principle gotten approval to remit by Key Tested
Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank
account you will provide by filing in an application
to NNPC and the Ministry of Finance for the transfer
of Rights and Privileges to the contractual sum to
you/your account.
I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in the
transaction, your share of the sum would be 30% of
the $26.5million, 60% for us, while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this transfer, both locally and international expenses.. The business itself is
100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with
utmost secrecy and confidentiality.
Your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the
successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
would not disappoint me.
Should you be interested or not in this transaction,
please notify me through this private
email: chris4120@primposta.com
or to call me with the tel number
above. If not also let us know, so as to enable us
enough time to scout for another credible foreign
partner or not to help carry out this transaction.
I assure you that my partners and I are in a position
to make the payment of this claim possible provided
you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee
that our share would be secured and please always
remember to treat this matter with the utmost
confidentiality, as any form of exposure would
compromise our positions in this government, being
active Government Civil Servants.
Once again, remember time is of great essence in this
transaction.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
I am pleased to get across to you for a profitable business proposal, though we had never meant in person but I got your contact from the Personal Assistance to the former Minister for Sports, more so she told me that this is your first time in partaking in such business but you are in a better position to handle the transaction/business of this magnitude without you running away with our own share of fund once your account is credited within 8 working days because before I commence we have to build mutual relationship in respect of this business that is strictly confidential and all the legal /essential documents to back up this transaction are in place. The key for us building up this mutual relationship is TRUST between both parties involved that is you and I.  I am in charge of the Auditing for contract payment with SAFA (South African Football Association) and I truly apologize for using this means to reach you for I have no other choice. Within the South African Football Association and the cooperation of my colleague, I have in my possession as overdue payment bills totaling Thirty Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$38.5M). With your assistance and fullest co-operation, I on behalf of my colleague beg you to help us receive these funds by wire transfer that is presently lying in a suspended account with ABSA Bank in Pretoria branch. It does matter whether it is a corporate or personal account but as long as the account is active to receive the amount of this magnitude, it is very ok to us. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operate offshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important towards the successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall both benefits from. This US$38.5M arose from the balance of the total contract value for the renovation and upgrading of (Pretoria, Johannesburg and Soweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to Germany before it was awarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president Mr Nelson Mandela) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately, though the actual contract cost have been fully paid to the original contractor. 
I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us (which I prayed and beg for) in the transaction; your share of the sum will be 25% of the total amount after Tax in any account you shall provide for the funds to be transferred into, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me because our share of the funds with your assistance we shall invest in property management/real estate business in your country. And that is why we offered you 25% of the total amount not just to receive the funds for us alone because once the fund is transferred to your account without your help we shall be lost since most of my life I have been a civil servant.
Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel and Fax number or my e-mail address: (DSolow@latinmail.com) if you are willing to help in this matter and I also want to guarantee you that my partner and myself are in a better position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.

Attention,
RE: TRANSFER OF US$48.223 MILLION 
[Strictly confidential]
I am Mr.Kemass  mcdonald , the operational manager in
account management section in charge of credit and
foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South
Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer
of my bank who perished on EGYPTIAN Boeing 737 PLANE
CRASH into the red sea with the whole passengers on
board.
He opened an account in this bank and died without a
written or oral WILL attached to the account. Since
his death, I personally watched to see the next of kin
but all has proved abortive as no one has come to
claim his funds and no other person knows about this
account or anything concerning it. The account has no
other beneficiary and until his death he was the
manager of his company here in South Africa.
The amount involved is 48, 223,000.00 USD. [Forty
eight million, two hundred and twenty three thousand
United States Dollar]. We will start the first
transfer with $8,000,000.00[Eight million]. Upon
conclusion without any disappointment from your side,
we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining
balance.
THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE and should be
treated with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.
Furthermore, your area of specialization or country of
origin is not a hindrance to the success of this
transaction. We are presently affected by the South
Africa Civil service code of conduct laws that
prohibits civil servants from operating private
foreign accounts.
I have discussed this issue with the Bank Manager who
I must involve for a smooth and successful transfer of
the fund to any account, which you will provide.
However, I want you to act as the next of kin to the
deceased by providing your bank account where the fund
will be transferred for immediate investment on any
viable project. The banking ethics here does not allow
such fund to stay more than 2 years without claim
hence the fund will be recalled to the government
treasury as unclaimed fund after this period of
dormancy.
I got your contact through my personal search to see
if you can assist by providing your safe bank account
for the transfer or find a reliable person capable of
receiving such amount in his or her personal account.
At the conclusion, 65% of the fund will be for me. 20%
for you, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your
country and the remaining 5% will be set aside for
expenses both parties might incurred during the
transfer process.
Kindly e-mail, fax or call me as soon as you receives
this email. You should also include your private fax
and phone numbers for easy communication.
Respectfully yours,
Mr.Kemass  mcdonald

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am Engr. Sule Alkali Director, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources (MPNR) Lagos, and have been delegated by my colleagues to seek the assistance of a reliable foreign company or individual into whose bank account we can transfer the sum of $36,560,000.00 USD (Thirty Six Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand U.S. Dollars Only). This sum arose from a deliberate over-invoicing of contract bills of some contracts, which were awarded by us (MPNR) during the administration of the former military dictator late, General Sanni Abacha who died on 7th June 1998. Since then the money has been lying in our suspense current account of MPNR with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)(our Apex Bank). However, the current favorable political/Economical climate in the country now presents an opportunity for this money to be Transferred out of our country without any hitches - as we hope and believe it would be of mutual benefit to both of us.
Already, we have put in motion the complete machinery and modalities to enhance successful commencement and completion of this transaction and further actions will commence the moment we hear from you. We have agreed that after the transfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 20% of the total sum. My two colleagues and I shall take 70% while 10% is being mapped out for reimbursement of minor expenses that may be incurred during the course of this transaction. Conclusively, the nature of your business is not particularly relevant for the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to co-operate with us, and also an assurance that our Share of the funds will be given to us when the money arrives your account.
Most importantly, we have taken all necessary precautions to ensure a no risk situation on the side of both parties as this transaction is expected to be through within 10 to 14 working days. Please if the proposal is acceptable to you, contact me immediately through this email address sulealkali10@netscape.net However, if you are not interested, kindly let us know and do not disclose the content of this letter to any third party. Kindly include your private Telephone and Fax numbers while replying for easy and effective communication.
The trust we have reposed in you at this point is enormous and cannot be over-emphasized. We await your prompt response to this proposal, so we can commence immediate release proceedings with our good positions.
Best Regards.
Engr. Sule Alkali.

LAGOS - NIGERIA.
IMPERATIVE AND PRIVATE
This letter may come to you as a surprise but it was borne out of my sincere
desire to share a mutual business relationship with you. First, your strictest
confidence in this transaction is highly solicited. This is by virtue of
its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.
We are top government official with a statutory corporation and members
of an ad hoc committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review
contract awarded by past administration. In the course of identifying, scrutinizing
and recommending for the payment of all valid contract executed, we discovered
a huge sum of money amounting to USD41.5M (Forty One Million five Hundred
Thousand US Dollars) on grossly over invoiced contract already awarded and
executed for the Department of Petroleum Resources. Having Cleaned the 'AUGEAN
STABLE' we intend to transfer the balance of USD41.5M presently floating
in our apex bank of Nigeria to our own benefit and advantage.
However, we request for your unwavering assistance in this regard because
as civil servants we are prohibited under the civil service code of conduct
bureau from operating a foreign account or running a foreign company unless
after retirement in this vain we want you to front for us as partner to
enable us lodge the funds speedily into your account. Bear in mind that
no risk is attached to this project and all logistics are in place and modalities
worked out for the smooth conclusion within a stipulated time. This is in
accordance with the fact that you must never betray the trust already reposed
on you. We have decided to compensate you with 30% of the total sum for
your support, 60% for us while 10% for miscellaneous expenses (local and
international).
Please, provide your confidential phone and fax number to enable my boss

and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris
Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yavlinsky)
which posed treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian president
before he was reelected On March 14, 2004. You can catch more of the story
on this

The fund (US$423M) in question was approved by the Government of Russia
for payment of various YUKOS OIL contractors/suppliers to prevent them from
loosing the money they invested in the numerous contracts they executed
for the above firm. The Government had already concluded plans to frozen
all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) both corporate and
personal before I connived with the Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who
is also my partner in this transaction) to raise a memo stating that YUKOS
OIL owe contractors the above amount which was finally approved for payment
after some deliberations. Actually, we have paid all our contractors both
local and foreign because they agitated for their payment when they had
that my boss was arrested.
YOUR ROLE:
I will present you / your company as one of the contractors we are owing
so that you can stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum or part
of the fund according to your financial strength or the strength of your
company. I will arrange for the documentation which the payee bank will
need to transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this sum to relocate
to American continent and never to be connected to any of Mikhail Khodorkovsky
conglomerates. The transaction has to be concluded before as soon as possible.
You will be rewarded with 10% of the total sum for your partnership. Can
you be our partner on this transacton?
As soon as I get your willingness to assist us in this deal, I will give
you more details. Thank you very much .

ATTN:YOU CONTRACTOR 
Dear Sir,
Sequel to the secretive arrangement in regards of the shipment of your contract
sum, I wish to inform you that all necessary modalities have been automatically
concluded and have left Nigeria to London via your Country today by Express
Cargo Flight.
Note carefully the content of the crate is "MONEY" but I did not disclose
it to the Courier Services as Money, rather I informed them that the crate
contain Vital "DIPLOMATIC DOCUMENTS" belonging to my client (that?s you).
Furthermore, the weight of the consignment is 90kg but I manage to pay 45kg,
which cost US$9,000.00. On no account should you disclose the content of
the crate with the Diplomatic Courier Services for fear of betrayal. So do
not allow them to know that the content is money.
In the meantime, contact the Global Trust Dipomatic Courier Services to the
Attn. Edy Smithkline on Tel: 44-77-46065722 or Email :g_s1@o2.pl to know
the actual situation with the consignment and also give them your address
where the consignment will be delivered and then get back to me as soon as
possible so that I can give you the shipment document.
Meanwhile, I will be coming over to your country immediately the consignment
arrives in your Country for my 10% share.
Please update me as you contact the Global Trust Diplomatic Courier Services
for more details you may need from me.
Congrats and remain blessed.
Best Regards,
Yours faithfully,

I am Mr.Gailu Fall , Project director Senegal National Petroleum Corporation (SNPC) and a member of Contract Tenders Board of the same parastatals. Your contact was reliably introduced to me at the Foreignchamber of commerce and industry in my search for a reliable individualand/or company who can handle a strictly confidential transaction,which involves Transfer of reasonable sum of money to a foreign account.
This money results from various contracts awarded by our corporation on behalf of the Federal Government, which was deliberately over invoiced to the tune of $15.500.000.00 (Fifteen Million Five Hundred ThousandUnited States dollars). After the completion and commissioning of the contract, the contractual sum was paid to the contractors, leaving theover invoiced sum in the reserve account with the Pacific Bank Plc. We therefore require the partnership of a foreigner or foreign firm to assist us in form of a trustee and provide an account for this transfer.In my last meeting with my colleagues, it was unanimously agreed that25% of the total sum would be given to you. 70% for me and my colleagues,while 5% will be used to reim burse the expenses that may be incurred during the course of this transaction
I assure you that his transaction is 100% risk free as we have concluded every arrangement to protect the interest of every one involved.Likewise all modalities for the successful transfer of this money have been worked out with the Finance Ministry to facilitate the remittance of this money to your designated bank account.
However, I will want to believe that you are honest enough and will not raise any mis-giving with respect to this transaction. More importantly,you will keep this transaction very confidential so as not to jeopardize this, once in a life time ambition
Finally if this business is of interest to you, then kindly contact me via email address herein Your immediate response will be highly appreciated
Best regards,
Mr.Gailu Fall.PRIVATE!
ATTN:Sir/Madam,
My name is Mr Michael eze the Manager, Credit and Foreign bills of trust 
bank of africa limited.
I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account
number 14-255-2004/utb/t whose name is Joung Heasook, Korea who perished in 
a plane crash[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on 
August 6,1997.And for your perusal you can view thisweb site
http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list
Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with
keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one 
has come to claim his funds of US$25.5M (Twenty Five Million Five Hundred 
Thoudsand United States Dollars) which has been with my branch for a very 
long time.
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the
Next of Kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking 
ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than eight years, because 
money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period.
In view of this i will give you 30% of the total. Upon the receipt of
your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax 
number and the next step to take.I will not fail to bring to your
notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain 
any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five 
banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.
When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying your
decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick
communication.
Yours Sincerely,

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL. 
I am pleased to get across to you for a profitable business proposal,
though I don't know you and we had never meant in person but I got your
contact from the Personal Assistance to the former Minister for Sports.
More so she told me that this is your first time in partaking in such
business but you are in a better position to handle the
transaction/business of this magnitude without you running away with our
own share of fund once your account is credited within 4 -5 working days
because before I commence we have to build mutual relationship in respect
of this business that is strictly confidential and all the legal
/essential documents to back up this transaction are in place. And the key
for us building up this mutual relationship is TRUST between both parties
involved that is you and I.  I am in charge of the Auditing for contract
payment with SAFA (South African Football Association) and I truly
apologize for using this means to reach you because I have no other
choice.Within the South African Football Association and the cooperation
of my colleague, I have in my possession as overdue payment bills totaling
Eighteen Million Three Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,3M). With
your assistance and fullest co-operation, I on behalf of my colleague beg
you to help us receive these funds by wire transfer that is presently
lying in a suspended account with ABSA Bank in Pretoria branch. It does
matter whether it is a cooperate or personal account but as long as the
account is active to receive the amount of this magnitude, it is very ok
to us. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South
Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not permit us to operate
offshore/foreign account of any kind hence you are very important to wards
the successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall both
benefits from. This US$18.3M arose from the balance of the total contract
value for the renovation and upgrading of (Pretoria, Johannesburg and
Soweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to Germany before it was
awarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president MR
Nelson Mandela) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm, which we
the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost
have been fully paid to the original contractor.  I have the authority of
my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us
(which I prayed and beg for) in the transaction; your share of the sum
will be 25% of the total amount after Tax in any account you shall provide
for the funds to be transferred into, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part
provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your
area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of
this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
will not disappoint me because our share of the funds with your assistance
we shall invest in property management/real estate business in your
country. And that is why we  offered you 25% of the total amount not just
to receive the funds for us alone because once the fund is transferred to
your account without your help we shall be lost since most of my life I
have been a civil servant.
Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel and Fax number or
my e-mail address: mrs_mabo@latinmail.com if you are willing to help in
this matter and I also want to guarantee you that my partner and myself
are in a better position to make the payment of this claim possible
provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our
share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very
confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of
exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once
again that time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipation
of your earliest response.

Dear Sir, 
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on
behalf of my colleagues. Your information were given
to me by a member of the South African Export
Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black
Economic Empowerment Commission (Government)
delegation on a trip to the United States during a
bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign
investors. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in execution of a deal hereunder
for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep
it confidential because of the nature of this
business. 
Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work
as the Director of Project Implementation, with
co-operation of two other top officials, we have in
our possession, an overdue payment in US funds. 
The said funds represent certain percentage of the
contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a
foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced to the amount of
US$41,500,000.00 (Forty One Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual
contract cost has been paid to the original
contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. 
The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe
that private investment in general, and foreign direct
investment in particular, are the real engines for
sustainable economic development, for which reason it
has continued to encouraged investment in the key
growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere
determination to pay foreign contractors all debts
owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close
relationship, and mutually beneficial co-operation
with foreign governments and non-governmental
financial agencies. As a result we included our bills
for approvals with the co-operation of some officials
at the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of
South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to
be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we
are not allowed to operate foreign account. The
changing of beneficiary's information/ details and
other forms of documentation upon application for
claim to reflect the contract money and its approvals
will be secured on behalf of your company or your
self. 
I have the authority of my colleagues involved to
propose that, should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be
20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and
the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all
expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so
incurred. 
It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of the nature described here. The
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and subcontracted it to other companies. More often
than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated
fields win major contracts, and subcontract to more
specialized firms for execution. 
This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat
it with utmost confidentiality. Also your
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I
have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me for further

Dear,
I am Dr. M. Tutu, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an
Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural
Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that
a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at
the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave
your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a
confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described
hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a
top secret because of the nature of this transaction.
Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars, which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual
to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company
account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the
circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not
allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.
This amount Twenty-Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand represents the
balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the
original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic
Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in
an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the
transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence
provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send
across to you.
I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25%
of the (Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars).70% for
us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is
100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and
confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to
the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence
in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me
immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whether
or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure
you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of
this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this
matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with
any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and
remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours faithfully,
Dr. M. Tutu

Bank (A well reputable financial institution with its branches all over
the world).
I seek your partnership to accommodate the sum US$423M for us. My Boss

president before he was reelected On March 14, 2004. You can catch more
of the story on this

the fund (US$423M) in question was approved by the Government of Russia
for payment of various YUKOS OIL contractors/suppliers to prevent them
from loosing the money they invested in the numerous contracts they
executed for the above firm. The Government had already
concluded plans to frozen all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail
Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal before I connived with the
Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who is also my partner in this transaction)
to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe contractors the above amount
which was finally approved for payment after some deliberations.
Actually, we have paid all our contractors both local and foreign because
they agitated for their payment when they had that my boss was arrested.
YOUR ROLE:
I will present you / your company as one of the contractors we are
owing so that you can stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum or
PART of the fund according to your financial strength or the strength of
your company. I will arrange for the documentation, which the payee
bank will need to transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this sum
to relocate to American continent and never to be connected to any of
Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates. The transaction has
to be concluded as soon as possible. You will be rewarded with 10% of
the total sum for your
partnership. Can you be our partner on this transaction?
As soon as I get your willingness to assist us in this
deal, I will give you more details. Thank you very much.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
BUSINESS PROPOSAL
After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided to forward to you
this proposal. We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer
the sum of US$40.5M (forty Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) only
into his account. 
This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from a contract awarded by
us under the budget, allocated to my ministry and the bill was approved
for payment by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed.
Commissioned, the contractor has been paid his actual cost for the
contract. We are now left with the balance of US$40.5M as the
over-invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over estimated for our
own use. 
But under our protocol division, civil servants are forbidden to operate
or own a foreign account. This is why I contacted you for assistance. We
have agreed that you will be entitled for 30% of the total sum, 60% for
us while 10% for any expenses incurred while transacting the business
and whatever left from the 10% will be shared equally.
As you may rightly want to know I got your address from our Chambers of
Commerce and Industry. I am a top official with the Ministry of
Petroleum Resources (MPR). We the officials involved in the deal have
put in many years of services to our ministries. We have been exercising
patience for this opportunity for so long and to most of us, this is a
lifetime opportunity we cannot afford to miss. This transaction is very
much free from all sorts of risks. 
To enable us get this fund paid into your account, we have to present
an international business outfit and consequent upon your agreement, we
will fax to you the information you will transcribe into your invoice
and send back to us. As soon as the funds are remitted into your
nominated account, three officials will visit you to arrange for our
share. All these will only take us 10 working days to transfer this fund
into your account right from the day we receive the requirements. 
NOTE: Your discussion regarding to this transaction should be limited,
because we are still in Government service. Let honesty and trust be our
watchwords throughout this transaction. And your 
Prompt reply will be highly appreciated. 
Best regards.

The DPR is now  compiling beneficiaries to be paid for the

accumulate the sum of Thirteen Million, Seven 
Hundred and Thirty One Thousand U.S Dollars as the 
over-invoiced  sum. This money is  currently in a suspense 
account of the DPR  account with the Debt Reconciliation 
Committee (DRC).

as contract payment to you as a foreign contractor, who will 
be fronting for us as  the beneficiary of the fund. In this 
way we can facilitate these funds into your nominated 
account for  possible investment abroad. We are not allowed 
as a matter of  government policy to operate any foreign 
account to transfer this fund into. 
However, for your involvement in assisting us with this 
transferinto your nominated account we have evolved a sharing 
formula as follows: 
(1) 25% for you as the foreign partner 
(2) 75% for I and my colleagues

Dear,
I am Mr Malick Diop, the director of Contract Awards
and Finance Allocations of the Federal Ministry of Works
and Housing. I presided over the award of the building of
the federal government satellite housing estates at here
in Dakar, the new federal capital city of Senegal.
During the bid for the contract, I had a pact with the
eventual winner of the bid and the contractor of the
project to inflate the contract sum to the tune of US$30
Million Dollars. The contract has since been executed, and
job completion certificate duly awarded. Furthermore, the
payment for the contract has been fully made to the
contractor leaving behind the over-inflated amount of US$30
Million Dollars, which I have secured under contract ref.
No: FMWH/FRN/108X01/2002.
The problem now is that as a senior civil servant, I am
prohibited by the civil service code from running a private
business or foreign bank account. Moreover, I am required
to declare my assets annually with the civil service
commission for verification and clearance, and therefore,
cannot defend this large amount of money as an addition to
my assets without compromising my reputation and the
impeccable records I have achieved over the years.
Therefore, I need your cooperation to be present as a sub-contractor
in the execution of the
project/contract to claim the fund on my behalf.
For volunteering your cooperation in this deal, you are
entitled to 40% of the fund. Should this be acceptable to
you, kindly indicate in writing and confirm the following:
Telephone and fax numbers for prompt communication.
Bank name, address and account number where the fund will
be moved.
Full name of company and address or personal name and
address that will serve as the beneficiary/sub-contractor
to claim the fund.
Furthermore, as soon as this fund is transferred into your
bank account, I will require you to still act as my agent
in investing my share in estates/landed properties and
financial securities in your country.
I want to emphasize here that this deal is free from any
form of risk from both parties as great care has been
exercise in perfecting it, and therefore, I enjoin you to
approach it with an open mind and without any fear
whatsoever. As a deal, I make haste to advise that you
should be private about it.

Attention Plz.,
My name is Mr. R. Lauder, a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II. It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims. The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts. Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that were interest bearing when established.
Note, the Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE with a credit balance of 35,000,000 US dollar plus accumulated interest was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate (living no wills).
Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. Through well-secured channels,I have the ability to flit away the funds into a bank in the Cayman Island, being a tax free, safe haven for funds of this nature.And to further obliterate any atom of trace to the fund, once in The Cayman Islands,I will relocate the funds to France through same well-secured established channel.
Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim the funds from France. All that is required is for you to provide me with your details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents for transfer of the funds in your name.And we share the funds.
Kindly provide me with your full names, address, and telephone/fax. I will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to France securely, from where you will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60 percent and your share is 40 percent of the total amount. THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED.
You can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the internet at the following websites:

CONTINENTAL BANK PLC
LAGOS, NIGERIA
Good Day,
My name is James William, a Manager with the above bank located in Nigeria, West Africa. I have a proposal for your consideration and will be glad if you would give your co-operation so that we could exploit the opportunity together.
The agent of an oversea penticostal church opened an account with our bank at the time of establishment some years back. The account is for the purpose of receiving support donations for the church.
Curiously, this account was only operated for one year and abandoned. For the past years, donations have been pouring into the account from ignorant donors. I investigated and found out that the church opened similar bank accounts in many countries and as it grew, some of the accounts were abandoned especially in countries where the church had no physical presence. It was also discovered that some of the evangelist/agents overseeing the accounts were disgruntled at how church finances were managed and had
to leave the church.
I have been monitoring this bank account for some years; - from the time when there was only US$500,000 in the account to now when the account has over US$15Million. The interesting thing is that the donations are unanimous; so even the donors keep their identity secret. I and my top colleagues at the bank have agreed to treat this money as an abandoned account. They mandated me to source for a foreign partner to whom the bank could bequeath the money for charity.
The financial laws of Nigeria is liberal in this respect as it permits the banks to bequeath such abandoned bank accounts to individuals or organizations that will use the fund for charitable courses.
My reason for writing you is to solicit your co-operation so that you could
be presented as the individual to whom this money will be bequeathed. We propose a 50/50 sharing arrangement between you and the CONTINENTAL BANK GROUP. If you accept, please confirm to me by a return email so that I can brief you on how we can harness this
opportunity to our mutual benefit. You should also provide me with your telephone
number to enable me call you.
Accept my best wishes as I await your positive reply.
James William

Hope you are doing very great? Getting your contact was not

Khodorkovsky (M.k.) of Russia. He is one time the richest

confiscated.
I would like to ask for your partnership in re-profiling
funds over US$423 million. I will give the details, but in

Dear,
I am Dr. E. Tutu, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an
Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural
Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that
a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at
the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave
your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen
-Million, Three Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars, which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual
to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company
account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the
circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not
allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.
This amount Eighteen Million, Three Hundred Thousand represents the
balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the
original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic
Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in
an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the
transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence
provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send
across to you.
I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 15%
of the (Eighteen - Million, Three Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars).80% for
us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is
100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and
confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to
the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence
in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me
immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or my e-mail address, whether
or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure
you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of
this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this
matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with
any form of exposure as we are still in active Government 
Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this
business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours faithfully,
Dr. E. Tutu

110 Half Edge Lane,Ellesmere Park,
Eccles, Greater Manchester,
United Kingdom
My Name is Fehmi Mehmi and I am a staff of Natwest Bank London. I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us.
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of £26.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twenty-Six Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. 
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. 
Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.
The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained after five years the money will be transferred into banking
treasury as unclaimed funds.
We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for me and my colleagues.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am BONGIES ZULU from Cape Town, South Africa and I am an Executive
Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources
affiliated (created) to the Department of Minerals and Energy. First and
foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a
transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality
and prompt access reposed on this medium.
Be informed that a member of the South African Export Promotion Council
(SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade
exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I plea to seek
a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described
Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top
secret because of the nature of this transaction.
Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of two other top officials, we
have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling TEN MILLION FIVE
HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLAR, (10.5) which we want to transfer abroad with the
assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the
said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive
such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South
Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore
account hence your importance in the whole transaction.
This amount TEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLAR ($10.5m)
represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my
Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid
to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said
amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic
Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the
transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.
I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that, should you be
willing to assist us in this transaction that is 100% hitch free, your share
of the sum will be 25% of the $10.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation
and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part
provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your
area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of
this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me.
Endeavor to contact me through above e-mail address or the fax number
whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will
enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to
assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment
of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured. And please remember to treat this
as very confidential because, we will not comprehend with any form of
exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once
again that, time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours faithfully,
BONGIES ZULU

Pleas Send your reply to this email address; (abbahnasser002@yahoo.it) 
Hello my dear,
Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is 
not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. I am Director of 
Procurement Department at the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral 
Resources, here in the United Arab Emirates.  I obtained your email 
while searching for a reliable person, who could assist me in 
receiving transfer of a supposed contract awarded funds.  This fund 
came as a result of over estimated contract awarded sums executed by 
foreign contractors in the Petroleum Ministry. This fund has been 
approved for payment to the contractor by the concerned Ministry. The 
contracts had been executed and commissioned. What I am about to 
receive now, is the over estimated funds which the contractor whom I 
helped during the process of obtaining the contracts added to his 
estimation for my own interest.  This is a normal deal that goes in my 
Ministry by top officials. 
On our part, all modalities has been worked out in ensuring a smooth 
conclusion of the transfer to your account within the next few days.  
All I want from you is to receive this funds on my behalf, because as 
Government Official I cannot collect the funds directly from the 
contractor, neither I am allowed by Law to operate/ run foreign bank 
accounts. If you are trustworthy and can assist me in receiving the 
fund, do not hesitate to respond back to me immediately.
Please note that there is no risk involved in receiving the funds in 
your account for and it will be done through wire transfer. I wish you 
to state in percentage what you shall have for the use of your 
account.  As soon as you indicate your interest, further details and 
the amount involved shall be given to you once I hear from you.  
Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. 
Looking forward to hearing from you soonest.
Best regards,
Engr. Abbah Nasser.

United Arab Emirates.MY MAIL MESSAGE TO YOU!!
>From Mr.Joseph Cabutti
20 SILVER CRESCENT,
Enugu,Nigeria.
Compliment of the day
I am Joseph Cabutti the consulting auditor with one of the prime banks here
in Nigeria. My search for a trustworthy individual/firm has led me to
you. I came across your contact while looking for a worthwhile investments
or projects that I can be affiliated with. I am writing you this letter to
ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.
The proposition
An industrialist and a foreigner who was customer of my client bank, who
died on the 25TH JULY, 2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with
the whole passengers on board. During the course of my auditing discovered
an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late NDUSTRIALIST who
died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his
death, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any
relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one
has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account
or anything concerning it.
The account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of
his company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00
USD {Thirty six million united states dollars} which the bank now expects
a next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to
get in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because of
the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin
and the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman
and members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement
for the funds to be declared "UNCLAIMED" and will be lost to the Federal
Government or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and
Ammunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa. In order to
avert this negative development, I now seek your permission to have you
stand as a next of kin to late beneficiary so that the funds USD36m would
be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin. We
wish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00[Ten million] and upon
successful transaction without any disappointment from your side; we shall
re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.
I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom
I must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which
would substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and
successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are
going to nominate. On this note, We have secured from the probate an order
of mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiary and more so we are
assuring you this business is 100% risk free involvement you should not
entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized
within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary
of the fund from the deceased. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of
the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum,
10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5%
will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the
transfer process.
If this proposal is acceptable by you do not make undue advantage of the
trust we have bestowed on you, then kindly get to me immediately.
Please furnish me with your private Telephone and Fax Number for easy and
safe communication.
Respectfully yours,
Joseph Cabutti.Good day, I know you'll receive this proposal with a total surprise and some kind of scepticism, based on the fact that we never had any prior discussion to this matter nor have we seen or known ourselves before, nevertheless I would like you to treat this proposal as a matter of its urgency and accord it every necessary attention required. I got your contact in cause of a serious search for a reliable person of foriegn origin who could help us.
I'm Mr Addonis Johnson, son of late Mr. Solomon Johnson, the former Director General of Sierra Leonian (diamond mining) Procurement Agency, Who died some years ago when the revolutionary united front rebels attacked Makeni town, Sierra leone. Following the cease fire agreement reached last year with the help of United Nation peace keeping troops(UNASIL), I used the oppoturnity to leave the country with a very important document containing (US$5.500.000) five million five hundred U.S Dollars deposited by my late father in a bank in Dakar, Senegal in my name as the next of kin.
This money was realised from diamond export, now I and my brother are seeking asylum in the Senegal under (UNHCR). My main reason for contacting you is that I received an information from the bank warning that I should make haste to dislodge the money or I loose it to my home government investigations on ex-governmental officials accounts. They advised I should present an individual, organisation or company as the beneficiary to the account since the money cannot be released to me as a client considering my status here as a refugee. All the accounting information are with me right here in senegal.
For your assistance and cooperation we have decided to give you 10% of the total sum realised after the sucessful transfer of this money to your account for our investments in your country. Please kindly communicate your acceptance of this proposal through this email address so that we can discuss the modalities of seeing this transaction through,
We count greatly on you for assistance. Awaiting to hear from you soon.
Thanks.
Yours Sincerely
Adonis Johnson.Good day
Dear Sir,
I personally decided to put in writing as below, the full details of this
business proposal that I have been trying to explain to you. I have a
re-profiling amount in an excess of US$58M, which I seek your partnership in
accommodating for me. I am willing to give out 25% of this total sum to you for
your quick assistance and partnership, 70% for me and while 5% should be set
side for reimbursement of any unforeseen expenses we both might incure in the
cause of this transaction. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this
transaction, which I am proposing to you.
My name is Robert Bada, I am the personal assistance to the former President of
Republic of Liberia (President Charles Taylor). President Charles Taylor
decided on the 11th of August 2003 to go into exile in a neighboring country
Nigeria to seek asylum.  Based on these developments, his various foreign bank
accounts have been frozen and some are still under serious investigation. But
in the light of all these happenings, President Charles Taylor was able,
through the help of some loyalist succeeded to secretly move the sum of US$58M,
on my name as the owner to a private security company vault in
Nigeria where the final crediting is expected to be carried out later. All the
depositing documents of the above fund were on my name and they are still in my
possession
What I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum and
I will arrange for the documentation which will enable the Security Company
transfer / wire the fund to your bank account. I have decided to do this only
with you and use this sum to relocate to European or American continent and
never to be connected to any of President Charles Taylor's conglomerates. This
transaction can be concluded within 2 weeks.
My questions are:-
1. Can you handle this project?
2. Can I give you this trust?
3. can you keep this business as very confidential?
4. If you can sponsor this transfer, Is 25% acceptable to you, as your
commission?
Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
YOUR REPLY:

private fax number 24317598570 or call me on telephone number 23417765782 (feel
free to call), so i can give you more clear explanations details and

London EC3A 8LE
I am Mr. Gary Adams, Senior Credit Officer, Barclays Bank Plc London. I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us.
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of £12.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds Sterling) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. You shall read more about the crash on visiting this website.
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/
http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because the Bank cannot release the funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to do business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.
We agreed that 20% of this money would be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for my colleagues and I. We will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me as trust is our watchword in this transaction.
Note that this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail whether or not you are willing to enter into this deal. In the event you are not interested, I sincerely ask that you disregard this email and tell no one about it. I am very careful on truncating my banking career should you mention this to someone else. I hope you can be trusted in this regard. 
Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalized. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response.
Please in your response include your telephone and fax numbers for a better communication between us.

Good-day to you and compliment of the day,

My movement and that of other my sister has been highly restricted; but luckily I was able to move out from Luanda Angola capital territory and am now in Dakar Senegal.
I am Eloy Sakiata Savimbi, son of the late General Jonas Savimbi; leader of Unita Rebel of Angola who died on the 22nd February 2002. Before the death of my father, he deposited the sum of US$15,000,000.00(fifteen million United States Dollars) in a private security trust company for safe keeping only. All the related documents are intact with me and I have currently contacted the company. My younger sister and I are in Dakar Senegal as asylum seekers pending when I get a Foreign partner; because of the monetary laws here which do not allow asylum seekers to operate any bank account.

Based on the above, I am contacting you so that you Will help me in retrieval and transfer of this fund to your account or any other designated by you for the mutual benefit of both of us and hoping that you will remain trust worthy.

Dear Sir,
HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
Greetings.
This mail may come to you as a surprise but I plead with you to patiently
read through it before making a decision whether to assist me or not.
I wish to solicit for your assistance in the transaction which I strongly
believes will be of mutual benefit to both of us if treated with trust and
confidentiality that it deserve.
My name is Mr. Peter Wang Qin, the branch manager of a reputable bank
in Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, in the Republic of South Africa. I and
two of my colleagues wish to seek your assistance in the transfer of some
huge sum of money into a foreign bank account.
This money was deposited seven years ago in a fixed deposit account in my
bank by an Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Mining
Corporation. (Name deliberately withheld for now) The length of time for the
maturity of the fixed deposit was five years, which expired towards the
ending of last year. Upon maturity, a routine notification was sent to his
forwarding address but got no reply.
After a month, a reminder was also sent and finally we discovered from his
Contract Employers - The South African Mining Corporation that the Depositor
died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that
the depositor/beneficiary actually died in a car Accident here in South
Africa, in May 2000 and he left nobody as next-of-kin to claim this money.
All efforts made to trace any known relations of his proved abortive, and no
one has written our bank in this regard.
Hence, this said money is still lying in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. Now it�s clear
no one will ever come forward to claim it. And according to the Laws of
Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 5(five) Years, the money will
revert to the ownership of The South African Government if nobody applies to
claim the fund.
All modalities for the successful transfer of this money into an offshore
bank account have been put in place and we are looking for a trust worthy
foreign partner into whose bank account this fund would be remitted to and
it is this regard that my colleagues have mandated me to provide a partner
who will assist us. We have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total
amount if you should accept to assist us.
If you are interested in giving us the required assistance, kindly reply
this mail stating your Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because of
the secrecy surrounding this transaction, l suggests that you contact me
only through e-mail, until further notice.
I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you soon. Feel free to ask
any question in this regard.
I remain,
Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Peter Wang QinGOOD NEWS
Greeting,
I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person.I believe you will not betray the confidence I am willing to repose in you, for me to have contacted you even though we've not met before.
My name is Mohammed Tankoh,the only son of late Mr.Hassan Tankoh who was the chairman /President/CEO,Cacao-Cafe & Agro-Alimentary industries plc.SCAFECAO)"Bouake" and ex-owner of Polyclinic LA-MADONNE, of the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire.
You can find the story on this website:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2269238.stm
On 19th of September 2002,a group of so called rebels took over the city of Bouake to over-throw the Government of Mr.Laurent Gbagbo the President of Cote d'Ivoire. On the 20th day morning at about 4:18am some fractions of the same group of rebels break into our house and killed our security guard and pass-through the gate entrance to the main building and took my father away to an un-known destination.
After about four hours later we found him (my father) at the road side, by then he had been totally beaten and was bleeding to death lying in the pool of his own blood. From there, we rushed him to a near by hospital and hours later he sent for my mother. So he told her that he can not make it from the doctors diagnosis, he also told her that it was because he (my father) was not from the northern part of the country that he has been treated this way and also being a political activist. And again he said he is suspecting some of his business partners for conspiracy and this sort of brutality. He also told my mother that he deposited a huge amount of money i.e US$ 10.5million dollars(Ten million five hundred thousand us dollars only)in a Finance house in the Capital city of Senegal (Dakar) and also told her where he kept the whole documents concerning this deposit that is made for investment purpose in the western world.
That same day, he (my father) gave up the ghost. Then with the help of the French soldiers, we escaped to Senegal, where we are now. I am now contacting you believing you are honest and trustworthy to help us to receive the money in your account for investment, I and my mother has decided in compensating you 20%of the total amount for your assistance .
Please do take your time to go through the mail and get back to us, so that I will simply introduce to the Finance house where the fund are being kept now for onward transfer. So you can contact me through my alternate email adressfor security reason.

I am waiting for your response.

with a solution to a moneytransfer of Thirty Two Million, Five hundred thousand United State Dollars (US$32,500,000.00) First of all I am an 
accountant and Auditor of the Petroleum (special) Trust Fund (N.N.P.C) the 
Apex Department of the Oil Industry in Nigeria.
I am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties, I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC), I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract, the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with a
very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons;
(i) As government employees ,we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the 
foreign firms, only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the 
whole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is 
first to furnish us with the following through my email address.
1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )
2.) The beneficiary's name,
3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a 
smooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you, we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party. This is very important because this deals involves some high ranking Nigeria 
Government Officials who would not want to be involved in any form of scandal.We however trust that this will be the beginning of a lasting business relationship between you and us as we shall appreciate your advice on the investment opportunities in your line of business or any other type of viable business in your country.If this deal interest you,reply me

Dear Sir/Madam,
Please forgive me if I intrude your privacy, we do not know each other but 
it does not matter. What matters is transparency between us in this deal. I 
am Mr.Victor Onyemachi. I came to know about you in my private search for a 
reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential business 
transaction. A foreigner, Name With-held until his death in a plain Crashed 
few years, banked with us here and had a closing balance of US$20.5M (Twenty 
Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) which the bank unquestionably expects 
it to be claimed by any available next of kin of the late beneficiary or 
alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for Arms and Ammunition 
at a National Military War College here in Nigeria.
Valuable effort have been made by our Institution to get in-touch with any 
of the families of the depositor but proved to no avail. it is because of 
the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of the families of 
the late depositor’s next of kin that the management under the influence of 
our chairman and Members Of The Boards Of Director that an arrangement be 
made for the funds to be declared Un-claimable and subsequently be donated 
to the Trust Fund for Arms and Ammunition to further Enhance the course of 
war in Africa and the World in General as you knows that war will eventually 
bring destruction to man kind. In order to avert this negative development, 
I now seek your permission to have you stand as the Next-Of-Kin Of. Late 
depositor so that the funds US$ 20.5M (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand 
Dollars) would be release and pay into your Bank Account as the Next Of Kin. 
Just recently the fund was moved to one an off-shore bank abroad Finance 
Company while the arrangement is also been made to donate the funds to the 
Military College if no body comes up for the claim.
I am contacting you because I want the two of us to work out modalities to 
secure the fund and use it for our benefit instead of donating the money to 
a war college. With me in the inside it will be very easy. All Documents and 
proofs to enable us get this Fund on your name as the legal beneficiary of 
the said fund will be carefully worked as the documents to be secure shall 
state that you alone is the next of kin and the beneficiary. This 
transaction is 100% Risk Free so do not be afraid. Your share out of the 
$20.5m depends on our agreement as we proceed with the deal. I will 
appreciate if you send to me your age, your job type and personal 
information in your reply to this mail. If this Proposal is all right by

Hello,
It is indeed my pleasure to write you this business request. I am writing you to solicit your assistance in a business partnership that could be of mutual benefit to both of us. I hope that you read thoroughly and response as promptly as possible. Precisely, in the year 2000, the Ministry of Minerals and Energy in South Africa where I work as a Manager of 14 Project Allocation, received presidential irrevocable circular order requesting the ministry to compile and forward the list of all past foreign contractors, whose contract payments are pending since the period of the past government of Dr, Nelson Mandela and the present government.
The purpose of this presidential order is that the present South Africa elected government will pay foreign contractors all debts owned, and thus maintaining a good relationship with other foreign government and non-governmental financial agencies. In light of the above, my partner and I duty is to compile a list of these contractors. We have decided to include a company name with a bill of {USD25 Million United State Dollars} along side other company names and their respective bill for payments. The {Alliance Mining SA PTY}, which was incorporated for this operation, also carried out contractual works for the ministries as well as others.
With the co-operation of top senior partner of mine we are confident that our claim of {USD25Million} shall be granted being for contract work executed at the Ministry of Minerals and Energy, payment shall then be transferred upon approval to a safe account that would be provided by you in other words, if you accept to be our partner then you shall be considered given the pertinent documentation to certify that your company had been awarded a contract already executed, for which your company shall be paid the sum of USD25Million. Please be informed that with the South Africa government monetary policy. Government official's employees are not allowed to operate or to own bank account abroad hence our decision to seek a foreign partner.
However, the legitimacy of this transaction is well pronounced, which I will personally explain to you by fax or telephone if you agree to be our partner to determine your true position. I have the authority and consent of my partner to offer this transaction to you. You will be highly compensated with a percentage upon mutual agreement by both parties after a successful completion of this project. Further information concerning the transaction shall be forwarded to you upon your response to this letter.
I can assure you that my partners and I are in a position to make this payment claim possible, provided you can give us the assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured. Visualize this opportunity as an indirect financial resource; also note that your area of specialization is not a hindrance in the successful execution of this transaction, endeavour to contact me immediately by the above alternative email address because we will not compromise this transaction with any form of exposure, as we are still in active civil service.
Please keep this close to your chest as much as possible; we can not afford any political problems.
Thank you and God bless, as I await for a long term mutually beneficially relationship for both of us.

Il tuo partner è un bravo amante? Scoprilo con l'aiuto delle stelle! http://www.jumpy.it/Canali_J/Oroscopo/articles.shtml?BXXCYXFYAG/art1318Dear Sir/M,
I am Mr.Daniez  Philip. a consulting auditor of a Bank in West 
Africa in west africa. I have the courage to Crave indulgence for 
this important business believing that you will never let me down 
either now or in the future. Some years ago, an American Mining 
consultant/ contractor with the Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporation,made a numbered time (fixed)deposit for twelve calendar 
months, valued $42M.USD (FORTY TWO MILLION US DOLLARS) in an account. 
On maturity, The bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding 
address but got no reply. After a month, The bank sent another 
reminder and finally his contract employers, the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation wrote to inform the bank that he died without 
MAKING A WILL, and all attempts by the American Embassy to trace his 
next of kin was fruitless. I therefore, made further investigation 
and discovered that the beneficiary was an immigrant from Jamaica and 
only recently obtained American citizenship. He did not declare any 
kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank 
deposit paper work. This money total amount$42M.USD ( FORTY TWO 
MILLION US DOLLARS)is still sitting in my bank as dormant Account. No 
one will ever come forward to claim it, and according to Nigerian 
Banking policy, after some years, the money will revert to the 
ownership of the Nigerian Government if the account owner is 
certified dead. This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am 
looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to 
beneficiary, and OPEN a Bank Account abroad to facilitate the 
transfer of this money. This is simple, all you have to do is to OPEN 
an account anywhere in the world and send me its detail for me to 
arrange the proper money transfer paperwork, and facilitate the 
transfer.The money will then be paid into this Account for us to 
share in the ratio of 60% for me, 35 % for you and 5% for expenses 
that might come up during transfer process. There is no risk at all, 
and all the paper work for this transaction will be done by me using 
my position and connections in the banks in Nigeria. This business 
transaction is guaranteed.And the first phase of the transfer will be 
($4M.USD) FOUR MILLION DOLLARS as advised by our insider in the 
bank.If you are interested, please reply immediately through my 
personal email sending the following details:
(1) Your Full Name/Address
(2) Your Private Telephone/fax Number. 
Please observe the utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that 
this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I 
shall require your assistance to invest some of my share in your 
country. I look forward to your earliest reply.
Yours,
Mr.Daniez PhilipPermit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you .
I am Fred pascal., The only son of late Mr and Mrs Jude Pascal. My father was a very wealthy GOLD and COCOA merchant who based in ACCRA GHANA and ABIDJAN respectively, The economic capital of cote D’Ivoire.

Hello,
I am William Wilcox, a private financial consultant
/Account portfolio manager. I happen to have managed a
particular account for a Resident Foreigner, here in
the United Kingdom, who accidentally died Interstate, 
leaving in our care a reasonable amount in a
Domiciliary United States Dollars Account. The
Highly confidential nature of our client and our
Business Confidential disposition on Client to client
Basis did not warrant us to have an easily
identifiable next of Kin to this particular Client. I
have made several enquiries to locate any of my
client_s relatives immediate and extended, this has
proved unsuccessful. Hence, I am contacting you. I
need you to assist in securing the money and property
left behind by my client before they get confiscated
or declared unserviceable by the Finance House here in
the United Kingdom where his deposits were lodged. The
Finance House has issued Government Mandatory
Formality, notice to provide the Next of Kin or have
the account confiscated within the next one month.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his
relatives for over two years and convinced that no one
is coming up and having satisfied the mandatory legal
requirement of Beneficiary/next of kin Notification, I
now seek a Reliable and Trustworthy person,
with your consent and perfect understanding, to
present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that
the proceeds of this account valued at Twenty One
Million, Three Hundred And Twenty Thousand United
States Dollars, interest Inclusive, can be paid into
an account to be provided by you( preferably outside
the United Kingdom Financial Institutions or its
Isles), as the perceived Next Of Kin Legally and
Otherwise.
I have all necessary documents to back up these claims
as Next of Kin on your behalf. All I require is your
honest cooperation and confidence in me, which I
believe that it is not easy, as we have not done
similar transaction before and not by reference. Hence
the reason I choose to call this a Deal, as it will be
based on trust to enable us see this transaction
through. I guarantee that this will be executed under
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from
any breach of the law. I would advise that you give
this a positive consideration and get back to me soon 
I would be very flexible as well as considerate in
percentage share that will be given to you for your
assistance.
Upon receipt of your response l will send to you my
private number so that you can reach me for further
discussion regarding this project. 
Please send mail to my private email for security reasons

My late father Modu Fahad deposited the sum of US$5.500.000.00 Million (Five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) under a custody of Finance Firm Dakar Senegal. However, I came to Senegal with the deposit documents of the money for the claim of the money out from the Finance firm and transfer to a foreign trustee with interest to secure a sustainable investment for my future survival.
I'm therefore soliciting for your assistance to help me receive the money out from Senegal and as well to transfer it into your private or company account for investment in your country under your control,because at my age,i don't have a business idea.

Last 4 years, a group of men from Africa were able to move the sum of $15M

Several calls have been made to the owners and none was successful on the
numbers given and now I have all
the paper work to transfer the funds via our payment office in Berlize to
your account without any trace as all documents will be destroyed by me immediately
the transfer is taken place after 5 days of receiving your details.
Just few days I discovered from the right source that the owner of this money
is dead and I have gone through his file and have discovered that he has
no Next of Kin to inherit his money. I want to use you as the Next of Kin
to enable me transfer the funds ($15M) to your account immediately.
Please this is very confidential and must not be discussed with anyone else
as I have prepared all my documents to effect the transfer to your account
once I have made all changes on the account. Also you will assure me that
you will not disappear with the funds hence I make this plea in good faith.I
have all the documents gotten from the Registry to put you in place as the
Next of Kin.

this done.

I am also a member of its Foreign Contract Tenders Committee (FCTC). My principal job/function has to do with the Appraisal and Approval of payment of contract awarded by this parastatal. In the course of my duties, I discovered various over inflated contract values totaling US$32.5Million. The said amount emanated from deliberate over invoicing of old projects executed by some foreign firms through some government officials.These officials have since been moved or retired following the inauguration of the new administration. After due consultation with key members of the Tenders Committee (FCTC), I was mandated to seek and arrange with a trusted foreign National who can assist us in transferring the above state amount out of Nigeria.Now that all the contracts have been paid following the completion and commissioning of the various contract, the above mentioned sum through approved is still floating. We decided to transfer this money to a safe and trusted bank accounts with !
a very reliable person to assist us after which the funds be share in the understated ratio.Your assistance is needed for two main reasons;
 (i) As government employees ,we are not permitted by the Nigeria law to operateforeignaccounts. (ii)Since the initial contracts were executed by the 
foreign firms, only a foreign firm can make claims or as a beneficiary for the purpose of transferring the money out of Nigeria.We have unanimously agreed to compensate you with 35% of the total sum ( US$32.5Million ) if you are willing to render us your assistance as regards the transfer. It was also agreed that 5% shall be set aside to offset incidental expenses that might be incurred by either of us course of offsetting this transfer. The remaining 60% shall be our due share.All necessary arrangements required for a speedy conclusion of this transaction have been put in place with top officials of the Nigeria Federal Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria to enable us conclude the 
whole transaction within a very shortspace of time.What is required of you is 
first to furnish us with the following through my email address.
1.) Bank details to be used (that is banks name and account number )
2.) The beneficiary's name,
3.)Your private / official telephone and fax number.While promising you a 
smooth and hitch -free transfer of this fund into the account nominated by you, we want you to know that this is very sensitive transaction which should not be disclosed to any other party. This is very important because this deals involves some high ranking Nigeria 
Government Officials who would not want to be involved in any form of scandal.We however trust that this will be the beginning of a lasting business relationship between you and us as we shall appreciate your advice on the investment opportunities in your line of business or any other type of viable business in your country.If this deal interest you,reply me 
immediately through my personal E-mail: uzoromaobi@o2.pl or call me on my

on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account 
holder has long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the

former operator of the a/c is a foreigner in particular and I am 
certainly sure that he is dead,because the the death was recorded by 
department of home affair and nobody will come again for the claim of 
this money A foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to 
the account Holder;therefore I need your cooperation in this 
transaction.
I will provide the necessary information needed in order 
to claim this money, But you will need to open an account or provide an

Kaba.My dearest in Christ,
My dearest in Christ,
May God be praised!!!
I am Mrs. Fatima Iyesa Ismiana, from Kuwait. I am married to Usman Ismiana
of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine
years before he died in the year 2000.
We were married for eleven years without a child he died after a brief
illness that lasted only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted
Muslim and I was a devoted Christian by birth battling with both cancer and
fibroid problems when my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of
$15million dollars (FIFTEEN million dollars) with an overseas finance and
security firm. Presently,this money is still with finance and security firm.
Recently, my doctor told me that I had aterminating illness (cancer) that
would last for the next four months.
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke s ickness, having known my
condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Christian organization
or a devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am
going to instruct here in. I want this Christian organization or individual
to use this money in all sincerity to fund churches, orphanages, widows and
also propagating the word of God and to ensure that the society upholds the
views and beliefs of the holy bible.The holy bible emphasized so much on the
giving of alms,charity and this ha s en couraged me in taking this bold
step.
I took this decision because I don't have any child to start from and where
I will stop and my husband's relatives are all Muslims and I don't want my
husband hard earned money to be misused by people that call me an
unbeliever. I don't want asituation where this money will be used in an
unholy manner hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that
after death I will be with God the most high and the most merciful one. I
don'tneed any telephone communications but will only give you the contact of
my lawyer Barr Brow Nelson. because he is the one who is going to assist you
in making you the beneficiary of the consignment in the finance and security
firm.With God, I know that all thing are possible and as soon as I receive
your reply through my lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the
beneficiary of the consignment and all necessary steps to take before
receiving these f unds and I shall also give you the contact of the finance
and secur ity firm I will also issue you a letter of authority that will
prove you as the original beneficiary of the funds.
I want you and the Christian community where you reside toalways pray for
me.Myhappiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian though
married to a Muslim, whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth
and in spirit, pl ease always be prayerful all through
your life.
Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for anotherChristian
organization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose.Until I hear from
you my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders,may the Almighty God
continue to guide and protect you.
Amen.
Yours faithfully,
Mrs. Fatima Iyesa Ismiana.CRY FOR HELP
My name is ROLAND DESMOND the elder son of Mr. David
DESMOND of Zimbabwe. This might be a surprise to you
about where I got your contact address. I got your
address from the senegal Chamber of Commerce,
During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe
from the supports of our President Robert Mugabe to
claim all the white-owned farms to his party members
and his followers, he ordered all white farmers to
surrender all their farms to his party members and his
followers.
My father is one of the best farmers in our country
and because he did not support Mugabe's ideas,
Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's farm and burnt
everything in t! he farm, killing my father and made
away with a lot of items in my father' s farm.
Before his death, my father had deposited with one of
the Security Company in dakar senegal sum of US$12.5
Million Dollars(Twelve million fivehundred Thousand
united state Dollars). After thedeath of my father,
we decided to move to the Republic of senegal dakar where
he had deposited the money inthe Security Company as
valuables.
So I decided to contact overseas firm and companiesa
that will assist me to move this money out of senegal
because as asylum seekers we are not allowed to
operate any bank account within senegal. I have
agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum for your
assistance, 5% will be mapped out for any expenses
that may be incurred in the course of this transaction
and 65% will be for me to invest in you country.
All I want you to do is to furnish me with your entire
personal phone and fax numbers for easy communication.
Note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and
absolutely confidential.

Mrs. James MasonKen Quattara.
Mr.Ken Quattara.
Ghana.
Good day to you!
I am requesting for your assistance in a deal of Considerable
financial gain for both of us.
I am Ken Quattara, I was the Personal Assistant (P.A) to the former
President of The Federal Republic of Togo, the late President
Gnassingbe Eyadema.
In the last week of January 2005, two security deposit boxes were
deposited on behalf of Mr. Eyadema by me with a company in Ghana.
The boxes contained 35 million dollars in cash. I have the
certificate of deposit issued by the company for the boxes. As his
trusted P.A I had employed the services of this particular company
to arrange the shipment of the boxes to Europe on his behalf were
they were to be picked up by a foreign associate of his at that
time, a French man.
This was not the first time I had arranged this kind of shipment for
Mr.Eyadema using this company. The boxes were labeled "photographic
materials" to elude customs and other checks.
Unfortunately, because he was ill-disposed at the time the French
man was no longer able to make the trip to meet with the company's
agents at the destination point. So the agents who accompanied the
boxes had to deposit them in a storage facility pending when he
could come.
On the 5th of February 2005, Mr Eyadema passed on while he was being
evacuated abroad for emergency medical treatment. He had been ill
for some years.
Following the demise of my former Boss, his associate withdrew, so
the boxes have been in storage since then. It was my function to
issue his associates Letters Of Athorization signed by me to pick up
boxes containing valuables and money. They banked money for him in
various pre-selected banks in Europe and Asia. The agents only
assisted the associates in the process to ensure that everything was
done under diplomatic immunity and within the stipulated laws in the
countries where such transactions took place.
I am asking for your assistance and involvement so that we can get
the money for ourselves. I can not do this on my own because i can't
so to say, authorize myself. If you accept to act as an associate of
the Late Mr Eyadema, I can issue to you the Letter of Authorization
for the purpose of reclaiming the boxes on his behalf for our own
benefit. As the beneficiary it will be your responsibility and
obligation (as stated in the coded agreement between the depositor
and the company) to reclaim and repossess the boxes from the storage
facility.
You will be required to meet with the company's assigned agent(s)
personally.
This way you will see the boxes for yourself and sign the necessary
documents to reposses the boxes. The agent(s) will assist you to
bank the funds and then thereafter you can transfer money to other
offshore accounts. This was how itwas done with previous associates.
Or you may choose to arrange something else with the agent(s). If
however you can not meet with any assigned agent, as the
beneficiary/associate to the Late Eyadema,you could request that an
alternative arrangement be made for you. You will have to discuss
this with the agent(s) yourself.
I assure you that everything will go smoothly if you choose to
cooperate with the agent(s). There is no illegality involved here.
If you do decide to get involved then i expect total commitment from
you. If you can do this, i am offering you 3 million dollars as your
own share.
If you are interested in this deal, then contact me immediately via
email(furnished above) for further details. Thank you for your time.

Attention: Sir/Madam, 
My name is Dr. Anderson Zuma  the manager,Credit and Foreign bills of ABSA 
BANK SOUTH AFRICA. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our bank 
with account number -908-14-255-114 whose name is Cho, Kwiyoung(Mr.), 
an American citizen who died in a plane crash[Korean Air Flight 
801] with the whole passengers onboard on August 6,1997.And for your perusal you 
can view thisweb site 
http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list 
Since the demise of this customer, I personally have watched with keen interest 
to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim 
his funds of US$15.5M (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thoudsand United States Dollars) 
which has been with our branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for 
whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin as no one has come up as his 
next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more 
than eight years, because the money will be recalled to the bank treasury as 
unclaimed fund after this period. 
In view of this I got your contact through a trade journal when i was making a 
research on a foreigner i will use in this great opportunity. For your assistant 
I am willing give you 20% of the total amount. Upon the receipt of your 
response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the letter of application which you will
type sign and send back to our bank to enable us start this processing of this claim.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you 
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has 
been finalized, this transaction will be completed within five banking days of 
recieving your response, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the 
deceased. 
When you receive this mail. Kindly reply to my private email address below

He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business associates. That I should
seek for a foreign partner in a country of my
choice where I will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose such as real estate management or hotel management.
Sir/madam I am honourably seeking your assistance in the
following ways.
1) To serve as a guardian of this fund since I am only 21years old
2) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my education and to secure aresident permit for me in your country.
Moreover Sir/madam I am willing to offer you 30% of the total sum as compensation for your effort/input after the successful transfer of this fund into your nominated account

Dear Sir,
Please I know that this letter may come to you as a surprise based on the fact that I have not had any previous contact with you.
Briefly, I am master Nelson Williams, son of the late Mr.Richard Williams, former director of Sierre Leone Gold and Diamond Corporation who was  murdered by assailants .
Shortly before this unfortunate incident, my father had informed me about an important contract he had executed (supply of Gold and diamond Mining Equipments)where he realized this fund ($15.5m)fifteen million five hundred thousand dollars and later when he heard the rumor of war in my country Sierra Leone he move the fund to Ghana where he deposited it.
He showed me some lodgment documents with which he had deposited the money encased in a trunk box with a security /safe deposit company here in Accra Ghana
He informed me in confidence that the security company is not aware of the exact contents of the box , rather he had told them that it contained African artworks
that he had assembled for his overseas partner who would soon be coming to claim them for exportation. As a result of this explanation, the box was accepted for safe-keeping by the security company without  inspection.
When the political situation in Freetown, Sierra Leone worsened, I escaped into Accra , Ghana and had since contacted the security company, identified  myself properly and informed them about the sad fate my father had suffered. I presented the lodgment
documents and they confirmed that they have the trunk  box in their vault.
So I informed them that I intend initiating contacts with my fathers overseas partner who owns the consignment so that he can come and take delivery of it.
My decision to retrieve this box, transfer the money and start a new life forms
the basis of this enquiry from you.
1) Could you assist me with the logistics and a good personal/company bank account through which I can retrieve the consignment out he security company
and transfer this money out of Ghana ?
2) Could you advise me on a good business proposition into which I can invest this money so that it would yield good dividends
3) Could you assist me obtain resident papers in your country so that I can continue my education there from where I stopped.
I sincerely will agree to any suitable percentage you may request for your assistance to me.
I shall prefer most of our communication to be done via phone. I need not inform you that this matter is strictly confidential. I want you to treat it as such.
God will surely bless you in abundance as you made up your heart to help an orphan like me.

My name is Mr.Olesito Armstrong. A member of Independent Committee of 
Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the Responsibility 
of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to Non-Swiss indigenes, 
which have remained dormant since World War II.
It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's 
Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by 
Non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of World 
War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.
The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons
(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts - 
54,000 in December 1995.The published lists contain all types of dormant 
accounts, including Interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, 
safe deposit Boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction
