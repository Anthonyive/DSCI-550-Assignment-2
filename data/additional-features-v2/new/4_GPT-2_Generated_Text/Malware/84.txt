My last email exchange with you was in mid-2004. I got your email in mid-2004 and decided to write you a letter. I told you that I had returned from a trip to Europe but I had to send you my last email because I needed the funds. I had to know that you and I had decided to meet in France for business. I decided to set up an account with you and one of my associates and I would have you meet at a bank in Paris to discuss a deal. We would meet in a private room and the transaction would be made. All money would be deposited with me and I would send a letter to you in reply hoping to be able to get the funds back. I told you that I did not receive this letter and I had no idea what to do with it. I told you that I had decided to freeze your account because it was the final step in my plan to freeze your account. I told you that you and I would meet at a bank in Paris and I will make sure that you and I understand each other well. I told you that I would be contacting you for your assistance in this matter.

I told you that I had no know-how or reason to believe that your application would fail. I told you that I had no plan in mind to freeze your account.
