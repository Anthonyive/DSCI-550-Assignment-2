This will be my first year as a owner of this business and I have decided to make this decision because I am a good person who has a strong passion for my business. I have decided to start my own business and I WILL NOT sell the business to anyone, I will not sell the business to any foreign country or partner.
I have applied for the business under the name of M. Berger, who is a very well known man who has a reputation of being a good man and a good partner. I am not a person who has a business relationship with anybody and I am also not a person who has a business relationship with anybody.

I will also not give any money to any foreign country, I will not sell the business to any foreign partner. I will do my utmost to ensure that I can do my utmost to do this as soon as possible.
Before we start we should probably start by having a few things in mind. First off, this is my business. I cannot be held responsible for the future of the business, I can only be held accountable for the future of this business. No one is responsible for the future of the business, I have decided to sell this business because I am a good man and a good partner. I want to leave no stone unturned to facilitate my business.
I am going to make sure that I am not the only one who should be held accountable for this business. This is because we are both in the company of one man, and he has a lot of problems. He has a very high profile, he is the best person of this business and he is no longer in the business of this business. The main problem that he has is that he is a rich man who is in financial trouble and he has a lot of problems.
