During the past week, U.S. Census Bureau data and some state data have indicated that the overall U.S. population is about 30 percent African American.

President Obama this week signed an executive order that will prohibit the government from collecting Social Security and Medicare data for the first time since the end of the civil war in South Sudan in 2011.

In a statement read out by President Obama in response to the U.S. military's deployment to the African country that killed more than 100,000 people, the president said, "This is an extraordinary event and I am going to be very concerned about the consequences. We will be looking into this as we have been doing prior to the deployment and we will be closely following it to the fullest. We will ensure that the data is not used for any government or business purpose, and we will continue to meet with the people of this country to share their stories, their stories of service to our country and God's Kingdom, as well as their stories of service to the country in which they are born and raised."

A spokesperson with the U.S. Department of State confirmed to the Associated Press that the data-collection operation will be underwritten by money from the United Nations.

"While we cannot share the full contents of this data-collection operation with the United Nations, we can share with you the full cost of the operation and the amount of the money paid to the UN in this transaction," said the spokesperson.

The United Nations has said that the United Nations has no position on this matter as the United States has been on an international and international level involved in the disaster in Darfur, Sudan and the refugee crisis.

A spokesman for the UN Security Council said he could not confirm the claim that the data-collection operation was underwritten by the United Nations, nor could he confirm that the United Nations had nothing to do with the operation.

"I have a lot of respect for the UN. I know that they have a lot of power, but I can't say that they are the most powerful. I just don't know that they are the most powerful. My role is to make sure that the various UN agencies and organizations that have got this information are held accountable and that they are held to account for their actions," he said.

The United Nations has the power to ask for the full account of all the foreign-born and foreign-born citizens of the United States in the year of its conquest of the country.
