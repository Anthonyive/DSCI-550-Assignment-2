The author of a recent op-ed in The Guardian said he has no idea what the authorities want him to write. He said he was "shocked and angered to hear about one of the most serious and sensitive political and legal questions in British political life".

Robert Smith, the former leader of the Conservative party, has been accused of serious financial crimes in the past over the nature of his UK business affairs loans.

He has not been charged but his close friend and former finance minister Sir Peter Morrison said he should not be in the country to sign the notes.

Mr Smith and his wife, Mary, both of Leeds, are due to appear before the High Court on February 27.

Following the audacious decision to issue the notes, Mr Smith's lawyer, James Holland, said: "He has made a serious and serious mistake in making the bank account he claims he funds in his private bank account in London. He and his wife have been involved in this business for a number of years before he moved to Britain with his wife.

"He made this mistake in the course of his life, and he is now under investigation for serious financial fraud. He has had a very long and direct relationship with his wife. He has stated with great confidence that he has never used his private bank account for any other purpose than to make the money he claims to be from his private bank account in London.

"He has a very strong trust and confidence in his wife, and he has never bothered to seek advice or any clarification from her counsel. He has accepted that he has no confidence in his wife, and has made an investment to fund this situation. He has suggested that he should not invest these funds in this way, but in the interest of the banks and the people of the UK.

"He has made a serious and grave mistake and, as an honest and trustworthy person who really knows his wife, his wife and his life is not in danger. He has made a mistake and he is now under investigation for serious financial fraud.

"This case is just one of many that have been put before us in order to put a stop to this terrible and serious problem that is taking place in our country.

"We are in the midst of an extraordinary political and legal crisis in this country. We are working hard to bring the Government to account for this crisis. We can only hope that this case will not only be brought out as a serious and serious matter for the Government to consider, but also put on the record that this is a serious and serious matter that we cannot let go of.

"It is a very serious and serious matter that has been put on the record that this incident will not have any effect on the Government.

"This is a serious problem that has been put on the public mind for a long time and we cannot allow it to fall through the cracks. It is not as if this has suddenly become an official matter.

"The Government has a responsibility to the people of the UK to understand that such an incident will not have a lasting effect on the Government.

"It is not a matter of whether or not the Government has the power to act. It is not a matter of whether or not it has the power to act in the interests of the people or the government, the question remains for the Government to consider whether or not to act.

"I am confident that the Government will be able to act in this matter in the interests of the people and the Government will be able to act in the interests of the people.

"The Government should have the full confidence and confidence of the people in this matter. This is a serious matter that has been put into the public mind for a long period of time.

"The Government has a responsibility to the people to understand that such an incident will not have a lasting effect on the Government.

"It is not as if this has suddenly become an official matter. This is not the case.

"The Government should clearly understand that this is not an official matter. This is a matter for the people to decide based on a number of factors.

"There will be no discussion of the consequences. The Government must act in the interests of the people. If this matter is put into public view, the people will have a choice. They can have this matter on the record, or they can not.

"The Government must not have the power to act in the interests of the people to act. It is not a matter of whether or not the Government has the power to act. It is not a matter of whether or not the Government has the power to act.

"It is a matter for the people to decide based on a number of factors.
