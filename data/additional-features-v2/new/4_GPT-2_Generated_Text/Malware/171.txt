The new account would be the result of the Fed's plan to issue new money in the funds when it is no longer needed.

The new account, with its cashed "printing account" will be worth up to $20 trillion, according to a government document that contains a new round of funds.

The new account will be used to fund the next stages of the next debate about the U.S. budget, with a possible call for more money in the next three years.

"The Federal Reserve has decided to make a change in our current system of making money, which is to make money at the market rate that it can fund its next steps," said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a statement on Tuesday.

"This is not something I've seen before, but I have said that in this situation where the next steps for the next generation can be made more effective by more investment, I am committed to the fact that we should fund this next generation of our children and grandchildren with just a few hundred dollars, which will be used to make money for the next three years."

Yellen said the central bank has made good progress in the process of making the next round of money available to the next generation, but she said the current system of making money is not working.
"In this particular case, it's not working, but the banks are opening accounts to make money. This is not just another effort to make money. This is a new process for the next generation," she said.

Yellen said the new account, with its cashed "printing account" will be used to fund the next stages in the next debate about the U.S. budget, with a possible call for more money in the next three years.
