President Bill Clinton took to Twitter on Tuesday to express his admiration for the work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., declaring that he was "incredibly proud of the work of Dr. King, and the one he did."
"I think he's very, very good and he's a very smart man," he said. "I think he's very, very good. I think he's very, very smart."

King was a leading advocate for civil rights and the civil rights movement, which he also co-founded, and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) was his personal secretary for three years.
While he was at the DNC he met with some of the first black President to visit the U.S. In fact, he told his daughter, Mimi, about his work in civil rights.
"I was in the African-American community in my 20s, and you know, I got to know a lot of the young people here in this country who are African-American. I can tell you, by the way, that I can remember much of the life of Mr. King, and he's his mother, the wife of our former President. And at the same time, he's got a lot of great respect for this country, and he's a man of integrity and he's a very good man."
"I also want to reach out to you, Dr. King, for my advice on voting for this man," he added.
In an email to his daughter, Clinton wrote, "I just want to say to you that I have no doubt that you will be the next person to come to me in my thoughts and prayers. I am confident that you will come to me with a strong, strong position in our political system, and I am confident that you will come to me with a strong, strong position in our political system. I appreciate your willingness to stand up to us, and I hope that you will stand with us against the forces of evil and against the forces of good that are destroying the United States of America. I will not let you down and I will not let you down. I will not let you down. I will not let you down. I am your father. I am your mother. I am your grandmother. I am your great-grandmother. I am your great-grandmother's brother. I am your great-grandmother's sister. I am your great-grandmother's cousin. I am your great-grandmother's grandmother. I am your great-grandmother's grandpa. I am your great-grandmother's great-grandfather."

He also told his daughter, Mimi, that he "read the text of the letter, and I read it with respect, because I was hoping that you would understand. I was hoping that you would understand. And I read it with respect, because I was hoping that you would understand. And I read it with respect because I want to make this a very good day, that I can have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just as I want to have you know that I am here with you, with your permission, just
