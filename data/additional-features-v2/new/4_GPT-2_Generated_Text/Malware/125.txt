The prime minister told the National Assembly that he would consider a motion to suspend the release of 800,000 asylum seekers on charges of fraud and abuse of power.
He said he would be ready to consider a new motion to suspend the release of the asylum seekers if he is elected president. He asked the parliament to consider the new motion.
"I want to see a government that has a plan of action and a plan of action that can actually bring in the money. One that can actually have the money in the country," he said.
He said this would be a political, not a legal, move.
He also accused the government of not being very consistent in its handling of the matter, saying that the time had come to give the country a chance to come forward, and he said he would be prepared to consider it.
He said that he has seen the current state of affairs and the problem is in the very heart of the country, and he would be prepared to consider any new move to put in place a political settlement.
He said the government has not done a good job in handling this issue.
"I am not going to let this happen. I want to see the fruits of this effort. It is going to be very hard for me to turn this around and I will not let this happen because the people I have worked with have come to know me better than I have ever done in my entire life," he said.
He said that after months of discussions, the government has not done a good job.
He said that the process was not going to be easy but that he was not going to let it get complicated.
He said that he had no confidence in the government because of the lack of political leadership in the government.
He said that he was not serious about the issue, but the government had not done its duty.
He said that he had not asked the president to say something in response to the asylum seekers, because he had no intention of doing so.
He said that he had no interest in the asylum seekers because he didn't know if there were any Muslims in the country. He said that he had never heard of the problem and he had never sought asylum in this country.
The prime minister said that the people of South Sudan had a problem, but he also said that he came to understand that this is not an easy situation.
He said that he wanted to discuss the issue and the new motion to suspend the release of the asylum seekers before he decided to come forward.
According to the prime minister, the decision he made was based on the fact that there is no political solution to this problem, and he needed to come forward to discuss the problem.
He said that he had come to understand that the problem is in the heart of the country, and he planned to seek the money to bring it in.
He said that he wanted to come forward to discuss the matter, because he wanted to know whether the money could be given to the people of South Sudan to end this crisis. He said that he had come to understand that the money cannot be given to the government that does not have the power to go forward with the release of the asylum seekers.
He said that he was prepared to consider any new move to put in place a political settlement, but, he said, he was not serious, and he did not want any political solution.
He said that although the president, who has no authority on this matter, has presented the money at the National Assembly, the president has not done a good job of handling this matter.
He said that he has not given the money to the government, and that he would like it to be done.
He said that the money should be given to the people who are under a political threat, that is, because the government cannot deal with this issue, and this is the reason why he has said he will consider the new motion of to suspend the release of the asylum seekers.
He asked the parliament to consider the new motion, and the leader of the Opposition of South Sudan, Habyarim Abacha, said he would consider the new motion.
He said that he was not serious, but he did not want to risk losing the money.
He said that he will consider it if the money is given to him.
He said that he had come to understand that the money cannot be given to the government because there are no powers to go forward with the release of the asylum seekers, and he needed to come forward to discuss the issue.
He said that he wanted to come forward to discuss the matter and the new motion, because he wanted to know whether the money could be given to the government that does not have the power to go forward with the release of the asylum seekers.
