I'm a huge geek and I'll never forget this conversation with my girlfriend, who is a big fan of comics. I've known her since she was a young girl, and in the late 90's, she was still around when I first met her. I came to know her through the web series The Amazing Spider-Man. She was the one who got me to write this comic. I was a huge nerd and am a huge proponent of the internet, but I was also a huge nerd of a different kind; I didn't know anything about comics. I was interested in the history of comics, but I just didn't know how to read it. I wanted to know if I could get past this and write something that would make me think of the origin of the internet and the world itself.
Before I started writing this comic, I was just a teenager, I had no idea what I was writing. I was in the midst of a huge project on my mind, and I thought, "I just got here to do this, so why not start writing it out here?" I thought I would start with this attack plan, and I got involved. I decided that I needed a way of making money in order to fund this project.
