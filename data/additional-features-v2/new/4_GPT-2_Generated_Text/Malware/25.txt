On February 24, 2005, the following day, KABUL issued a news release asking urgent questions.
I must inform that I only have one weild of the amount of money that KABUL has.
I have been informed that the money is being deposited into my account.
I am a member of the Liberal Party and I have no problem with my position on this matter. I am not a member of the State and as a result, I cannot make any further comments on this matter.
I, KABUL, have every right to make a decision in this regard, and I have the power to do so.
Therefore, I have decided to disclose this to you under the provisions of article 30 of the party law.
This is a legal document that states that I am a member of the party and have all the rights and obligations of a member of the party.
I have committed myself to the party and the principles of the party and the party's policy.
I am determined to assist the party in this respect and assist the party in its policy.
I have a task to do.
I am the only one who can make a decision.
I know what my task is and must make it a result of my decision and my own decision.
I have no other option but to act as a true friend, the only one who will be a reliable partner in this process.
I understand, I know and I know that the situation will not be easy.
I will stand up and work for the party in this respect. I will not let the money be used to enrich myself in return. I will not give money to anybody without a genuine interest.
I will not let the money be used to enrich myself for the benefit of the party.
