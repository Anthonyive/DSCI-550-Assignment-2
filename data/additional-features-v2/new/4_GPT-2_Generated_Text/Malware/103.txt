KITRAT (Ma'an) -- A Palestinian working in a Palestinian refugee camp in the West Bank said he has asked for his access to a U.S. security firm that he said is interested in helping him in his effort to go to the United States.

It's been three weeks since the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the U.S. took over the West Bank and Gaza Strip following the March 30, 2015, attacks by Hamas militants on the West Bank.

In a letter to the firm in question, the Palestinian refugee said he wanted to send a copy of his passport and the address of his family in the United States.

The letter, which was signed by seven Palestinian refugees who are in the United States, has been confirmed to be the same as a copy of his passport and the address of his family in the United States.

In an email to The Electronic Intifada, the firm that is handling his request, the Palestinian said he wanted to send his documents and an email to the firm, asking for their assistance in the investigation.

The Palestinian said he was a U.S. citizen and that he had sought advice from the firm on how to handle such a request.

The Palestinian said he had already made contact with the firm's Security Consultant Unit and other experts about his request, but now that the firm is looking into the matter, he also asked for his assistance in his investigation, he said.

The Palestinian claimed that the firm has in fact been involved in the investigation of his application for access to a security firm that he said is interested in helping him in his effort to go to the United States.

The Palestinian who sought his assistance, also asked for assistance in his investigation of his application for access to a security firm that he said is interested in helping him.

The Israeli security firm has said that it will respond to the request in a "very timely manner" to facilitate his return to the United States.

The Palestinian said he was in the United States because he wanted to return home to Israel after a military operation that he said was opposed to his country's security.

He said the firm has no political connections and that the United States should not send him money to return home, but that he would like the United States to consider the cost of his return of possession to be low.

The Palestinian said he has offered to go to the United States to seek his asylum, since he has no private sector background.

The Palestinian also asked that the firm not send his documents and an email to the firm, because he did not want to be contacted by the firm after he reached the United States from the West Bank.

The Palestinian said he has to contact the firm and that he did not want to deal with the firm directly.

The Palestinian asked that he not disclose his identity to the firm because he has a bank account in Israel.

The Palestinian also asked that the firm do not send his documents and a text message to the firm after he reached the United States from the West Bank.

The Palestinian said he has made several attempts to reach out to the firm on the phone.

The Palestinian said he was now in the process of contacting the firm, but he has not received any response.

He has also received no response from the firm, and the Palestinian said he has not received any reply from the firm.

During an interview with The Electronic Intifada, the Palestinian said that he had made numerous attempts to reach out to the firm and that he had not received any reply from the firm.
