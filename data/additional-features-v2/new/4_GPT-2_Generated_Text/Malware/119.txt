Nawazuddin's political party will soon be decided.
During the first round of the electoral college elections on 30th January, the Nawazuddin's party will have to win over only 25 per cent of the votes to claim the seat. This is the result of a surprise move by the Nawazuddin's party.
The party has been in the news recently for its decision to use the death of former chief minister of Punjab Thane Yousuf in the Lok Sabha elections to oust him as the government's chief ministerial candidate.
Yousuf, who died in a police shootout, was the leader of the Party of Pakistan (PBUF) which had been given the most seats in the Lok Sabha elections when the success of the Lok Sabha elections in May 2010 took hold.
The party had no plans to change its political line to win the general election. The party had sought to dominate the political spectrum in the state, but its leadership had no mandate to do so.
For this reason, Yousuf was forced to resign as the chief ministerial candidate of Punjab.
Yousuf was the party's chief ministerial candidate for the 2015 Lok Sabha elections in which he defeated the then leader, Shahbaz Sharif, who had been the leader of the opposition.
The party then decided that he would be the next prime minister of Pakistan.
Yousuf, who was one of the party's top political leaders, was in favour of the prime minister's resignation.
The party also decided to apply to the Lok Sabha to change its political line.
