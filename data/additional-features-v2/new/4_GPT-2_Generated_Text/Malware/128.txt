Many of those who have followed the news of the arrest of two leading figures in the judicial corruption scandal, including former President Felipe Calderon, are now demanding that the government of President Manuel Zelaya end the country's unconstitutional investigations into his role in the fraud.
President Zelaya, who has been under house arrest since May, has been under house arrest since May and this year he was arrested over accusations of his role in the corruption when the government was caught with more than $1.5 trillion in cash in his office. At the same time, he is under house arrest since May.
"I demand that your government immediately end the country's illegal investigations into Mr. Calderon's role in the corruption," said a statement by the President's Office.
Bafetimbi Gomishebali, the leader of the government's political and economic intelligence agency, said in a statement that the impeachment process against President Calderon will be had by the end of May.
The former president was charged in a case that involved more than $500 million in offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands and the US. He was in the US on a business trip.
Gomishebali said he had come to the US to meet with leaders of the International Monetary Fund and the International Monetary Fund, and later met with a senior government official and have now been informed that the charges against him will be brought against the US government. He said the President was being held in custody by a foreign foreign governments security agency and that he had been interviewed on several occasions.
He said he had come to the US to meet with officials of the International Monetary Fund and the IMF, and then claimed to have met the officials of the two entities to discuss foreign investment and related matters. He also revealed that his identity papers have been seized and that he had been arrested by the US government.
The President told his officials that he had been arrested through his own investigation of banking and financial crimes. He said he had laid charges of both his country's foreign and domestic security agencies in the case and he had instructed his officials to come to the US and meet with him to discuss the matter.
He said he had not been informed of the charges against him by the US government, but he had told his officials that the charges against him were being brought against them because they were involved in the conspiracy to defraud the United States.
