Virtually all of the information we collect is based on the websites and social media of our target customers and has been appraised by the expected customers.
We believe that the best course of action is to seek out the best possible customer who will come forward to offer a financial and personal investment for our business.
We have based our decision on the following four criteria:
We need to supply the customer with the right information to make this investment happen.
We must have direct contact with the customer and/or the customer's position and/or position of delivery.
The customer must have the necessary knowledge of the business and expertise in order to make this investment happen.
The customer must have at least 30 days to answer all the questions and should be able to present the information to us within 30 days.
We must have the customer's identity with us because our staff have a duty to provide the customer with the best possible investment result.
