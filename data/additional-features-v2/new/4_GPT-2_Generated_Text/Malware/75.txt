to find a good use for the money.
I am a US citizen and I have been interested in the sale of my country's flag since my first visit to my country.
My country is in the Republic of Tanzania, West Africa. In 2003, I was given permission to use the flag of my country on my business account.
My company, however, was a small company, with a small staff. I had a strong desire to bring the company's money into my country, not just in the United States.
I made the decision in a manner that was not in my plans , and it was in the interest of the company to make the money available to me. A few days after I requested to make this request, the company approached me with an offer to make a profit.
I told the company that this money would be used to pay for the use of the flag and other business information in my country. The company also offered to use the money to make the re-entering of the country of my birth as a member of the company.
My goal was to make the money in my country and to use this money to bring the company's profits into my country and to use this money to make the re-entering of the country of my birth as a member of the company. But, I decided to make the request in the spirit of a good deal of respect, as I have decided to make the money from this money in my country.
I have made a total of $1.5 million in the last 12 months, of which $1 million is cash, $3.5 million is bank deposit, $3.5 million is savings account. I have also brought the funds into my country for use on my business account.
I have decided that this money should be used to fund, to make a profit, the re-entering of my country of birth as a member of the company. The company has agreed to the terms of this agreement and I intend to make the money in my country by the money I have brought into my country.
I have informed the company that I am the owner of the company and that the interest in this money is good and the company has agreed to the terms of the agreement.
I have offered to make the money into my country in accordance with my desire to make the money and have the company give me the money to make the money in my country.
