I got this email from a friend who has been attached to one of my other projects, and it's been very hard to find the information since I got this email. He told me that he needed me to explain to him why I decided to use his money to fund my own wedding. I said that I needed to get on with my life and make the right decisions for my life. He told me that he knows that I am not a very good person and that I am not a social person. I said to him that I can respect that and that I were not with a lot of money. He told me that he is not a very good person and that he is not certain that I can meet his expectations. I said to him that I have never met a person who can be so good that he can't be trusted with "the money". I told him that I am not going to sign this in a private email and that I would like him to know that. I said that I have no reason to trust this person. He said that I had a very good relationship with both of his parents. The few times that I have told him I want to get on with my life, he has never been able to come to an understanding with me. I told him that he never met a person who is so good that he can trust you. I told him that I have an investment fund under his control. He told me that he knows that I am not a good person and that he cannot trust me with the money. I told him that he can only trust me with this money since he is very very good at making money and needs more money. I told him that I have read the money and know that he has no way of knowing that this is a private account and that his parents are not in the business of making money. I told him that I have no money to invest in this project and that I don't know where to put this money.
