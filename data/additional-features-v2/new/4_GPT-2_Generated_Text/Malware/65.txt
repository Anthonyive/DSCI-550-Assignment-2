I have a very small group of friends who have been made the grandest and most important decision of their lives: I want to change the relationship between them and my children. I want to make amends for the fact that I did not act on my husband's advice and because of this I am not responsible for his death. I don't want this to turn into a public death, because I believe that this is an act of God's will and that God has given me over my life to act in this way. I also believe that my husband is a good man who has a good heart. I want to make amends for the fact that I did not act on my husband's advice and because of this I am not responsible for the death.

I am not responsible for his death because I know that this is not a private death, but a public death.
