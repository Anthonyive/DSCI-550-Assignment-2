<|endoftext|>The following is a transcript of a phone conversation between my father, a businessman, and my mother, a businesswoman, who is a member of the United States Senate. The phone call came from my father, who lives in New York City. I ask him if he knows of any members of the Senate who are interested in donating money to his behalf. He tells me that he knows of a number of people who have donated money to the United States Senate, including Senator Jim Himes (R-S.D.). He claims that he has been in contact with Senator Himes in regards to his business and political donations, and that he is interested in donating the money. He then states that he will give it to his family and website, and that he will donate it to the Senate for his own use. I ask him if he knows of any others who have been in contact with Senator Himes. He tells me that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and that his family has not contributed at all to the Senate. He also states that he knows of one who has done so.
We have had this phone call before, and he has called me to say that he is interested in donating the money. As this is the final piece of the puzzle, I have to ask him to release the money to me. I ask if he knows of any other members of the Senate who have donated money to the United States Senate. He responds by saying that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, but he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, but he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, but he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, but he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has contacted me to say that he has not made any donation to Senator Himes, and he has sent me a message, and that I should put the money into a bank account with my parents, and that he would turn the money over to me for my personal use.
I read this message to my mother, who has recently died, in my parents mail, and I read this message to my mother and can read it to myself, as I have done for the past 30 years. I have been a senator, and I know that my children will not be able to understand what I have done. In order to understand the truth behind this, I need to know that I am not a politician. I am not a political person. I am not a politician because I have a low opinion of myself, and I have no business here. I am a business person because I am a businessman. I have a business plan and I want to make the world a better place. I will
