A group of startup investors who are seeking to invest in a cryptocurrency venture in Hong Kong have discovered that they have not received any payment from the bank, but rather from a third party.
The company, e-ventures, which was launched in February last year, claims to have received a total of US$10.5 million from the bank but, as a result of the bank's failure, the fund was frozen and has since been closed.
The company has since asked for the funds to be returned to the bank in the form of cash and deposits, as well as to claim as a guarantor.
The fund is looking to invest in the development of a new cryptocurrency that will enable it to make more money.
It is a decentralized and anonymous cryptocurrency that is through the use of private keys, so to avoid the need to transfer funds to someone who is not a member of the trust chain, the fund will need to use a private, reliable and non-trivial number of private key pairs to create a total of USD10.5 million.
The fund had received the funds from a third party and has since been closed, the fund is expected to recover its funds as soon as possible.
The fund has become so wealthy that it has reportedly been worth US$1.5m to US$1.5m.
The fund has also claimed US$500,000,000 from the bank, while a total of US$1.5m was claimed from the trust.
The fund has been in operation since February last year but has now begun the process of being frozen and has since been closed.
The fund's last night of business learnt that, because of this, the fund is in danger of being shut down.
The fund is a private company and the bank has not confirmed the existence of the fund in its official statement.
The fund's portfolio of US$US20m.3 million were transferred to a trust in government in particular to ensure that they would not need to be returned to the bank.
The fund's chairman, Yacoub Ibrahim, a former member of the security services, has left Hong Kong and is now in the process of leaving Hong Kong.
The fund was initially registered in the Hong Kong government but was operated by a private firm that has not actually been here to invest.
The fund, which has received US$5.5 million from the bank, has since been made available to a number of private individuals and has now been closed.
The fund has also claimed US$500,000,000 from the bank, while a total of US$1.5m was claimed from the trust.
