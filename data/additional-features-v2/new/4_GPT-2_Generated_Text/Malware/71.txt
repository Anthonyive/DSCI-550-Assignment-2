SOUTH ATLANTIC CITY, N.Y. (AP) — Police on Monday said they may have the keys to the missing woman.

Police said a black sedan was found on the ground in the parking lot of a home in the South ATLANTIC CITY neighborhood of South Fulton, south of Westchester, on Monday.

The woman was last seen on Monday morning when she left her children on the porch of her home. Her children were not home at the time of the shooting.

Three investigators from the South ATLANTIC CITY Regional Crime Unit were called to the home, which was not in the same location.

One of the investigators, who has been in the area for a few months, said he was able to locate the woman in the area but he did not know where she was.

The investigation was open and the investigation was under way.
