DETROIT -- The Detroit Red Wings have agreed to terms on a contract extension for forward Daniel St. James.
The Red Wings signed St. James to a five-year, $5.5 million contract extension as of Wednesday. The deal was in the works for more than a year and a half but St. James is still in his third year.
St. James, 28, has 15 goals, 34 assists and 17 points in 45 games with the Red Wings this season. St. James, who has been in the Red Wings organization since 2004, has six points in 12 games with the Red Wings since he was assigned to the White Sox in 2003.
He skated in the Red Wings' third game of back-to-back seasons, scoring the game-winning goal in the 5-2 win against the Calgary Flames on Tuesday.
He said that he is confident he can continue on with his old life and that he did not want to turn his back on his old life because he wanted to send a message to those he has lost.
"I am happy to be here and I am excited to be here," he said. "To be able to be here and to be able to say I am here and I am happy to be here with you. I am very humbled to be here with you. I want to thank you for your kind and generous support.
"But I can not do this alone because I want to send a message to the entire Red Wings organization. I want you to know that I am here to help you. I am here to give you the best chance to win now and to be here together in the future."
The Red Wings will have to make the same decision with St. James this season as they did with last year's second-round pick in the 2004 NHL Draft, as he had been the Red Wings' first-round pick in the 2006 NHL Draft. St. James is the third pick in the 2004 NHL Draft and the fourth choice in the 2006 NHL Draft.
Red Wings General Manager Ken Holland said St. James, who had been the third overall pick in the 2004 NHL Draft who was released in March, will have to make an agreement with the Red Wings to a five-year, $5.5 million contract extension to end his six-year contract.
"We are delighted to have this project come to fruition. Our goal is to make this our final project before it expires," Holland said. "It's a logistical nightmare for the organization, but with the work we have done with Daniel St. James and his family, we are confident that he will be a great son.
"We are working to ensure that we have the best possible deal to last this long," he continued.
St. James, who is married to a former Detroit Red Wings chief executive, is the son of former Detroit Red Wings forward and home school coach Brad St. James.
The Red Wings were in need of a major addition this offseason by the Detroit Red Wings organization.
The Red Wings have 3,600 players. The club is worth $4.5 billion but the total of players listed on the Red Wings' official international roster is $7.7 billion.
St. James left the Red Wings organization in 2006 and announced his retirement on Nov. 30, 2006. He left the Red Wings organization in a two-year sweep of the 2009 Stanley Cup finals, but his decision to turn his back on his old life brought with it a new cost of living.
The Red Wings did not make the playoffs in that year and St. James, after a deal with the Red Wings in 2004, made his last-minute decision to turn his back on the team's long-term plans.
St. James, who was a highly sought-after free agent after his successful 2004-2005 season, told the Detroit Free Press that he had decided to turn his back on the team in 2004, but he did not want his children to see him turn his back on his old life.
St. James said he did not want his children to see him turn his back on his old life because he did not want his children to know that he was at the helm of the organization.
"I am not going to turn my back on my old life. I will not turn my back on my old life. I will not turn my back on my old life," he said.
St. James said he was the only person who could have made the decision to turn his back on his former life and to make a deal with the Red Wings.
"I did not want the children to know that I was at the helm of the organization, I did not want them to know that I was at the helm of the organization. I did not want them to know that I was the only person who could have made the decision to turn my back on my past life and to make a deal with the Red Wings. I did not want them to know that I was
