We have a lot of experience in the field of foreign policy. Our country has a long history of political instability in the country.
We have been in this position for years now, and our country has been a partner in the political and security establishment.
In 2001, we were under the leadership of the country's royal family.
The military and security establishment have completely turned against the West in the last few years.
In the past few months, there have been seven per cent of the population in Iraq.
We have seen a great deal of change in Iraq.
The most recent round of military operations in Iraq led to the overthrow of the regime of President of Iraq Salafis Al-Baghdadi.
We have had a lot of people with us for the past few months, and we have seen a lot of people who have come to our country to take advantage of a political crisis.
This has led to a lot of people coming to our country to take advantage of a political crisis.

He has been re-elected in 2004, and he has been in power since 2006
