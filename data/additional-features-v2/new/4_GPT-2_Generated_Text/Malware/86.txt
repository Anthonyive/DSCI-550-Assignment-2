A number of people have asked for more information about the alleged abuse of children by US soldiers in Iraq and Syria and whether they were involved in the death of children.

The police in Iraq and Syria have said they are not sure if they have discovered any child involved in the death of a child, but that the investigation into the matter is ongoing.

A child's death in Iraq and Syria is now under investigation by the International Committee of the Red Cross in Beirut.

Local media reports have claimed the death is caused by a "powerful man with a handbag containing the body of a child".

The man, identified as Saad al-Hussein, was the youngest of three children born to a Syrian father and a Lebanese-born mother. He died after being hit by a US Air Force plane and dragged out of a hospital in Baghdad on an urgent basis.

The US coalition has already confirmed the father and mother were killed in a US drone strike.

In a statement, the coalition said that one of the men was killed and the other seven were wounded.

The US has stated that it has no information on the identity of the deceased and is not aware of the nature of the investigation.

The death of the two children was first reported by the British Mail newspaper in February, 2007.

On the same day, the Iraqi press said that a US military plane had shot down a military helicopter as it flew over Iraq and Syria.

The US has not confirmed the death of the children, but has said that it is assisting foreign states in the investigation.

No further information has come to light about the incident.

The US military has been accused of killing a number of children, most recently on 24 February last year.

The West, including the United States, has seen as a threat to the stability of the region.

In the face of this, the United States has been stonewalling efforts to discover the death of the children.

However, the United States has not given up on the idea that these children were the children of US war criminals and that they came from a war-torn country.

The US has also been working to find out the identity of the deceased as it was not immediately known whether the father of the children died in Iraq or Syria.

However, the US government is now ready to discuss the case to determine whether a death could have been avoided.

The investigation by the US military has revealed that the US military has, in fact, killed a number of children.

The children's remains were discovered in a US military base in the southern Iraqi province of Qamishli on 21 February, 2007.

The family of the deceased, who had been in Iraq for more than five years, were to be shared with US military personnel. The family is now in Turkey and is preparing to move out of Iraq in October.

The United States has been absent from the family since the death of a US Air Force pilot two years ago, but it has since been accompanied by foreign officials who have reported to the US that the family remains in the US.

The families of the dead were contacted by the United Nations, the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the International Commission of the Red Cross, which have contacted the families of the deceased.

The families have agreed to come forward with the names of the dead to inform them of the reasons for their death.

The families decided to stand by their way as they were informed of the decision to share the children with the US military.

US officials, who took over the investigation after the death of the pilot in February last year, have stated that the children were never in a position of safety because of the risk of their safety being compromised.

US officials have also said that they do not have the authority to make an official informed decision on whether or not the US military should drop its investigation into the death of the children.

However, the family has made it clear that they are not going to do that and they are not going to give up the children.

The family is now ready to move out of Iraq to Turkey and seek refugee status from the United States.

The United Nations has also sent a delegation to Turkey to discuss the matter and the families have agreed to share the family with the family for the purpose of communication.

The families have been given the option of staying in Turkey for the next 24 months or leave the country to seek asylum in the United States.

The United Nations, which has pledged to act to relocate the families out of Iraq, says that it has made no attempt to find out the identities of the dead, but is now confident that they will come forward with the names of the dead and the assets to fund the move, which is being carried out through a private firm.

The family is also considering the possibility of moving out
