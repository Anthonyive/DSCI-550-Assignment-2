: The Secret to a Better Future
By the end of January, after 10 months of wrangling, the President of the United States, Barack Obama, offered his resignation as United States President. He had been in office for the last five years and had been the country's most important and influential leader since the death of his father, Nelson Mandela. He had been a political and economic leader who had maintained a firm hold on power, especially in the South African political sector, and had had a good relationship with his secretary of state, the African National Congress (ANC). He had also been a close friend of an old friend, Nelson Mandela. In his resignation letter to the President, he declared that he wanted to keep his position as an elected President of the United States. He also said that he would not seek reelection to the Presidency.

The President had happily accepted the resignation letter and had wished for it to be sent to his office, but at the time he did not have the necessary documents to do so. He had decided to resign because the United States had not passed any law requiring that the President be removed from office.
