Cape Town - Cape Town Council on Wednesday passed a bill to add 12.5 million Zimbabweans to its board of trustees, the highest sum ever to be paid by the country's richest man.
The bill, passed by the city council, was passed by the international body's committee on the use of public funds, which includes the government and the private sector, and was signed into law by the President of Zimbabwe, who is the president of the country.
Mr. Mugabe is a former head of the state-owned National Police (NPP), the armed forces of the country, and a former president of the country's ruling African National Congress (ANC) party.
The bill was passed by a vote of 688 to 4.
The bill was passed by the chairman and chief executive of the committee on the use of public funds, who is the president of the country.
Mr. Mugabe, who ruled Africa for a fourth time in his life, was elected the next president of the African National Congress (ANC) party in late May and was sworn in as president on June 24.
In June, the committee on the use of public funds, which includes the government and the private sector, passed a resolution that called on the president to use funds to fund the health, education and welfare of his people, as well as to provide security, education and welfare assistance.
The bill was passed by the committee in response to the outcry over a security incident at a public university in February in which three of the students died as a result of a bomb threat.
The investigation into the incident, which was discovered by the three students, took place just before the start of the general election in May, and into what was expected to be a crowded election day.
The president has been under fire since the incident and his political decision to seek re-election was widely condemned.
The committee said in the resolution that the president should have the right to have a bank account with the interim head of the NPP, who will be in charge of the country's affairs, to access funds he has deposited in his bank account, which he is credited with by the president.
The chairman and chief executive of the committee, Dr. Mugabe is the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party, a party that has been under siege in the past over a security incident at a private university in February.
The president's campaign has already been beset by widespread anger and frustration over the incident.
In a recent interview with the South African newspaper, Saturday's bill was published by the committee at the request of the president's office.
The chief executive of the committee, Dr. Mugabe, said he stood by the president's decision to use funds to fund the health, education and welfare of his people.
"I stand by the president's decision to use funds to fund the health, education and welfare of his people. It is a moral imperative to care for the life of our people and to protect their health and welfare," Dr. Mugabe said.
The president's role in the committee, which includes the president of the African National Congress (ANC), the president of the country's largest private sector, and the chairman and chief executive of the committee, has been under investigation for months by the president's office.
The president's position has not been confirmed by the committee.
The president has said that he has no plans to be president at this time, but the president's office has said that he will seek re-election.
The president's office has also said that he has no plans to be president, but has said that he will seek re-election.
The president's office has said that he will seek re-election.
The president is under investigation for one of the most serious security incidents in the country's history.
The President's office has said that it is investigating a serious incident at a private university in February, which was in the course of his election campaign.
The president's office has said that the president and his wife have suffered serious injuries as a result of the incident.
In a telephone interview, the president said that he had started to prepare for a potential presidential election when he was attacked in his house by a group of armed men who had threatened him.
The president has said that he does not know who was behind the attack, but he has told the press that he did not know who the attackers were and that they were not his relatives.
The president's office has said that it is investigating the incident as part of his campaign to be president.
The president, who is also the vice president of the Presidency of the African National Congress (ANC), said that he had not yet decided on his next course of action to be president.
Dr. Mugabe, who served as a man of the people during his power struggle, has lived in exile in Zimbabwe for a year.
Over the weeks since his death, the president said he had not decided on his
