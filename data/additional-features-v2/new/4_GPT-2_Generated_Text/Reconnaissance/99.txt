"I would like to start this relationship with you through you. I am now a man of my own free will. I want you to know that I am ready to give you my attention and my desire to help you. I have decided to invest in you at a very low cost. My husband and I are both in law practice here in the United States. We are both married with two very young children. I am currently in a visitation with the attorney general of the United States. I am not allowed to have any more children because of your business activities. I wish to meet you on the same day of your arrival from abroad because this will give me the opportunity to invest in you as well as your future children and I also want you to receive a full refund of all your money. I want you to have my back immediately. I want you to receive the same amount of consideration as I and hope that it will not be too hard to receive.
I am the eldest daughter of a former president of the United States who is now dead. I have lived in a United States military asylum since I was six months old. I was told that I could not live in another country and that I needed your assistance because I have been imprisoned in a military prison in the United States of America for over thirty years. I am now in the custody of a foreign military authority based in the United States of America. I have followed your instructions and have been able to get the job done. I am hoping that you will help me in this regard. I am also seeking a foreign partner to assist me in this field.
I am currently a student in Biology and I am looking forward to my next career in this field as soon as I receive your letter of acceptance. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested in this opportunity. I am seeking a person of high integrity and integrity to serve as your next of kin.
I want to assure you that I am not a political power and that I have no political interest. I am looking forward to your reply as soon as you are ready to assist me in your development and investment of this money.
Sincerely,
Your dear brother and sisters.
Sincerely,
R.21.2006
