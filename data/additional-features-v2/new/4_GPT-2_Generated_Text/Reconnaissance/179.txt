MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's central bank said on Monday it was offering to enhance credit from foreign banks and companies that have been awarded contracts for projects involving the project.

The central bank said it would offer a 50 percent interest rate on the approximate amount of money acquired for the fund, which would be credited to the fund's account.

The fund will be used to offset the operating costs of the fund at the end of next year.

It will also be used for the maintenance of the country's debt-free credit facility.

It also said it will facilitate the transfer of the funds to other countries where they could be used for other projects.

The sale of up to 14.5 million euros of civil and military money is made after the bank is awarded a contract for a project involving the project.

This project is part of a five-year plan to build a new Spanish military base in Managua, a major oil-rich offshore oil-rich country.

It has been worked out by private companies based in Spain, through the cooperation of the oil ministry and the Social Democratic Party of Spain.

The money will be used to fund the construction and other expenses of the new military base.

The company is led by a foreign-born director of a private company.

The fund was meant to be used to offset the operating costs of the fund at the end of next year.

It will be used to fund the maintenance of the country's debt-free credit facility.

It also aims to enable the fund to be used for other projects.
