The National Security Agency is seeking to acquire the right to print and control more than 100 million dollars in customer accounts, according to a report in the New York Times. The customer account is the mutual fund of a top official in the Chinese government.
The money, which is worth about $1 billion, is the result of a co-operation of five companies, most of whom operate in a secretive manner.
Yahoo, which is now in the process of acquiring the customer account, said that the co-operation of the five companies, which are known as the "back doors," is the reason for the request.
The company is not in a position to be connected with the money because of the security of the customer account and because the details of the transaction were not disclosed to the outside world.
A joint venture with the Bank of America and Bank of New York Mellon is expected to be completed soon.
After successfully securing the customer account, Yahoo and Bank of America have decided to seek for another partner.
Yahoo has said that the company will be seeking a foreign partner to assist them with the fund, thus accelerating its growth.
The company plans to invest the funds in a foreign bank which will handle the transaction for the customer.
Yahoo said that the fund will be deposited in the account of the representative of the bank for the fund transfer, as well as the funds in other accounts of the customer.
