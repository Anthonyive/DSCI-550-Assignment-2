This is the first of a series of posts I will share how to attach a special cord to a special project I am working on to achieve my dream of becoming a "Elite Service Provider". I am the project's manager and technical advisor. I was working with my wife, Myllena, as a consultant for a Private Limited Company (PLC) that would be run by a Swiss-born businessman. In the course of our discussions, I came to the conclusion that I had a problem with my service. I had not had any contact with the company before I had found out that I had a problem with my service. Since my wife is a Swiss citizen, I decided to contact her via Skype and then instruct her to attach a special special cord on my behalf.

We were able to reach a person who was able to contact us through my direct contact. He/she was a married man who was doing a business in Switzerland under the control of the Executive Board of a Swiss private-partnership company, that was in bankruptcy.

I was seeking to resume my business as a private contractor for the company, based on my belief that I could use my position in the company as a financial aid fund for the purpose of investing in a company that would produce huge profits.

At the same time, I was still in my early twenties when I first met my wife in a private office, where we were both married. I had no interest in money so I decided to seek for a partner who could help me to invest the money that I had invested in a company that would produce huge profits for me.

I have a very high level of confidence in my skills in finance, but I am still not certain whether to invest this money in a company I am interested in becoming a Private, private contractor for. I decided to use this money to invest in a company that would produce huge profits for me.

I now want to contact a Managing Director of the company in question, and I want to hear from you as to the reason for this transfer of this funds, I am a Swiss citizen, I am interested in this project, and I want you to assist me in the next steps.

I have made a series of invoiced documents for you to assist me in this project. I have given you a list of the documents that I want you to furnish me and give you your name and telephone number for the purposes of this transfer.

However, I want you to be my only contact in this project since I am a Swiss citizen and as a result, I am hoping that you will come to my attention, since it is my duty to assist you in this project.
