There is no school or group that can teach you this. It is to your satisfaction that I am the only one that can instruct you on the subject. I am Joseph V. We have been engaged since I was in prison. I have completely put myself into the service of the struggle of the people of Christ, since I am a man of the People of the Bible, and that is why I am able to keep this from you. I have personally been writing to you regarding your proposition, but you have not been able to respond to my letter. I therefore have decided to send you a copy of my letter which I hope will bring you some comfort in this situation. I am Joseph V. We are both under the leadership of the Church of Christ, which means that we are both under the command of the Holy Ghost. I am the only child of Christ, who died at the end of the last world war, but who was the first to receive the blessing of baptism, which was given to him by the Holy Ghost. It is my wish that you may be able to assist me in the success of this mission. I want to assure you that I came to this country with a clear and undeniable mission, and that I am here to serve as your guide in this endeavor. I would like to make this request with the express intention of gaining the trust and loyalty of your most faithful and faithful colleagues and officials.
