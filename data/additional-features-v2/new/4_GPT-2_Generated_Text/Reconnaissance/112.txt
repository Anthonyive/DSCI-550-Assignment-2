I want to thank you for your cooperation and for your willingness to assist me in this project.
I have been searching for a dedicated member of the community who will help me in my search for a suitable person to assist me in this project. The current situation is that I am currently in a foreign country and I am unable to travel and for some reason have to make a choice of where and when to live. I want to ask you to assist me in this project if you are interested in assisting me in the matter.
I would also like you to provide me with a bullet proof bank account and a phone number for the person who will handle the payment of the transaction. I also want your assistance in the arrangement of the account. I will ask you to provide me with your own telephone and fax number for this transaction.
The purpose of this transaction is to provide for my daughter to continue with her studies in the foreign country. I am currently in the process of taking the application for a foreign partner to assist me in this project.
I am going to be contacting you to transfer your investment in the bank account as soon as I receive your reply. Please contact me immediately if you are interested.
I want to assure you that you will be the most kind and generous person to assist me in this transaction. I will be contacting you in the next day or so if you are interested in assisting me in this project.
Thank you for your interest and I will contact you immediately if you are interested.
Thank you for your assistance and I will see you soon.
Thanks in advance.
Yours faithfully.

I am Nakta W. 
I am a married mother of two young children. 
My husband, for reasons of my marriage, decided to desist from the means of not paying my child any amount for the past ten years of my life. 
I have only a husband and a daughter. 
Theirs is the only way of saving money for me. 
I was in a situation where I needed to use my United States Bank account to withdraw money for my daughter. 
I immediately decided and decided to contact you for transfer of the money to a foreign account for the benefit of my daughter. 
I am also going to request that you assist me in this transaction. 
I will urge you to contact me immediately if you are interested.
Thank you.
Yours faithfully.
