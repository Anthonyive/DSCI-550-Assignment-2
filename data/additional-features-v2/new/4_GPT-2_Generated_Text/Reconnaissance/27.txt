MUSKEGON (Reuters) - The United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) said on Thursday that war crimes were a major international problem facing Libya and that the United States should stop all military operations in its country.

The two atomic powers said in a joint news conference in Geneva that they were considering a reparations fund to help Libya's victims, in a bid to diversify its economy.

The two countries have agreed to make a joint declaration of war in the next three months over the war in a war that has killed at least 300,000 people in the country since March 2011.

The United Nations and OIC said that they were looking to establish a fund of $1.7 billion ($1.5 billion) to provide compensation for those who were killed while government troops were fighting it.

The United States said on January 30 that it had received a diplomatic proposal from the United Nations and OIC by which it would give the fund to the foreign partner who is responsible for the maintenance and rehabilitation of the country's civilian infrastructure and its civil society.

The United Nations and OIC said the proposal should include a guarantee of the death penalty for anyone who supplies arms, ammunition or other military equipment to the government.

The two nations said the fund should be used for health and other expenses.

"The United Nations and OIC are seeking for a reparation fund that will be used for medical, educational and other expenses required to support the civilian population in the country as well as military personnel, with a view to assisting the foreign partner in the recovery of the country's civilian infrastructure and civil society," the United Nations and OIC said in a joint news conference in Geneva.

The United Nations and OIC said that the United States has not received any diplomatic proposal from the United Nations and OIC by which it should give the fund to the foreign partner who is responsible for the maintenance and rehabilitation of the country's civilian infrastructure and civil society.
