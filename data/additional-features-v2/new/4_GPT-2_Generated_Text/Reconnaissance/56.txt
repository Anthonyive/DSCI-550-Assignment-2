In a special report to the Government of the United States of America, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released a report stating that the DPRK's foreign minister, Choe Ryong-dae (who was previously arrested and extradited to the United States) is now under house arrest in a foreign country where he was allowed to seek asylum.
According to the report, Choe Ryong-dae was arrested on February 14, last year and extradited to the United States on the same day as his release because of allegations that he met with the head of an NCP group in the country, as well as that he failed to disclose his foreign and diplomatic residency in the United States.
He was also extradited to the United States on October 30, next year and has since been released.
Choe Ryong-dae has been in custody since his arrest and the United States has issued a restraining order restraining him from leaving the country for five days.
