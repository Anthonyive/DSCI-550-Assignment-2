The federal court in Seattle dismissed a lawsuit seeking to compel the sale of a huge Russian oil and gas reserves, after a US district court judge in Seattle dismissed the lawsuit in December.
The Federal District Court of Seattle (CDS) on Friday dismissed the lawsuit filed by three Russian oil and gas companies in US District Court in Seattle.
They claim in their lawsuit that the Russian oil and gas company was violating the law by transferring the poverty-stricken population of the Gulf of Siam into the offshore oil and gas reserves of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The court says the company was not allowed to operate in the country due to a war situation. The court also said that the money was being used to "receiving compensation from the government of the UAE for losses incurred by the company in the past year".
The Court of Appeal said that the UAE is the only country with large oil reserves on the continent.
The court said the amount of money is "in excess" of $30 million, which the company says is in excess of $100 million.
It also said that the company said it was now planning to re-export the money to the United Arab Emirates, where it will be used for its own investment.
However, in the meantime, the companies are still being held in US detention in Washington DC for their alleged misappropriation of foreign assets.
