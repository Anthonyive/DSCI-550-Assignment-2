MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday it had arrested a former senior adviser to President Vladimir Putin, who was making senior appointments to position for the top diplomatic post in Moscow.

The ministry said Sergei Kiselyov, who is the co-chairman of a consortium of Russian banks, a former minister and the head of the P.G.K. bank, was among those arrested.

"The foreign ministry has given the name of a former government minister to a person who was making high-level appointments in the P.G.K. bank as chairman," ministry spokesman Andrei Kiselyov said in a statement.

Kiselyov was the ex-minister of state and the head of a consortium of banks that included the K.G.K. on behalf of the country's former foreign minister, Paul Kuttner, according to the ministry.

The ministry said Kiselyov was arrested on July 25, a day before the start of a new election in the country's second-largest city of Nizhny Novgorod.

He has been on the run since he was arrested in 2004 over a graft scandal.

Kiselyov is said to have been a top political adviser to President Vladimir Putin's son, who was killed in a bombing in the capital Moscow on July 26.

The ministry said Kiselyov had been a member of the P.G.K. Bank for two years, but the money was seized by the Russian Federal Security Service, the highest Secretariat of Security.

It said his brother and younger brother were also among those arrested for their involvement in the money-laundering.

Kiselyov's lawyer, Lennart B. Vanden Boeynant, said in his statement that the money was being managed by a foreign bank owned by the government. The ministry said the bank had been given a certificate of trust by the ministry, which states that its outstanding balance is $85.2 million.

He said the money was being used as a means by which the foreign ministry could release the money to their clients, which it has done.

Backed by private security companies, the foreign ministry said Kiselyov's name is a member of a consortium of six Russian banks owned by the P.G.K. and other foreign partners, and the son of the former foreign minister.

He is said to have worked as a close associate of the regime's top political adviser who was killed during a bombing of a Moscow airport.

The ministry said Kiselyov is accused of having made some of the most senior appointments to positions in the bank under the leadership of the late former foreign minister, Paul Kuttner, who was the head of a consortium of Russian banks.

He is the president of the consortium and is also a member of a consortium of firms that were also involved in the money-laundering.
