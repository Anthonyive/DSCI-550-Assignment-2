I feel quite strongly that this is a question of the form of the documents that were made available to me by the United States Government. I am writing to assure you that your assistance will be appreciated and that you will receive your full share of the proceeds of the sale of the compound to the United States Government. I assure you that my passport and my mobile telephone should be kept in my custody and that I shall be entitled to all expenses of the sale. I am also asking the assistance of your assistance in the execution of your authority and position as administrator of this transaction, and also for your assistance in the payment of your expenses.
I will also be requesting that you assist me in my transfer of the money to the United States Government. I intend to use your assistance in the execution of this transaction, as well as your assistance in my decision making.
Please provide me with your name, telephone, fax and e-mail address. I will forward this information to you on the following dates: July 8th, 1999, 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM Eastern Time.
I want to assure you that I am presently in the process of seeking a suitable political asylum for myself and my daughter. I expect that you will seek me out for your assistance if you are willing to assist me in my somewhat successful presentment as a foreign country official under the Federal Government.
I will be waiting for your reply on this application. I am glad that you will see that I am a highly qualified person. I will seek your assistance in this matter.
Yours faithfully,
Kris
