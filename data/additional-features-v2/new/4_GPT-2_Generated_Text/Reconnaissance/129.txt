"The Islamic State has killed over 10,000 people in this country, but I am afraid that this will only reach about 200,000 by 2015. I want our country to know that this government has a responsibility and that, in this regard, I have no other choice but to seek assistance from you."
Mr. Almak was killed in a bombing in the western part of the country by a group of Islamic State (IS) militants who were taking part in a major military campaign which has claimed the life of a senior military officer. He was the son of the late Prime Minister Ibrahim Almak.
Mr. Almak was also the son of an late former military commander who was killed in a US-led coalition bombing campaign in the Middle East and Africa in January 2011.
The death of Mr. Almak, who is now in a prison in Chisinau, has deepened my sorrow over the death of my friend, who, while a student, worked in a foreign country. He was a successful businessman who was the first foreign businessman to receive the honour of the rank of Major General of Foreign Service (MNG) and the rank of General of the Air Force (AF). He was told in one of our military ministries that he could not work in MNG because of his age and because he lacked a contract to operate a foreign service. However, after a visit to his family in Amman, he got a contract with the United Arab Emirates to operate a foreign service in that country.
The United Arab Emirates government in this respect is very interested in the transfer of this contract to your country. I want your assistance to assist me in all matters pertaining to this transfer. I fear that, in this regard, I will need to seek your help in all matters relating to the transfer. My heart is sad for your loss, but I want you to be confident that you will be able to assist me in your course of action and that I will not be swayed by your political opinions. I will help you to ensure the security of the country, and your safety.
I want to express my sincere joy for your death. I want you to reach me in confidence and assure me that you will carry out my business as a foreign service contractor. I want you to assist me in the course of this transaction and I want to assure you that my business will be safe and that I will not be swayed by your political opinions. Please send me your full name and telephone number as soon as possible, I am praying to hear from you.
Yours in God,
Dr. Hassan Almak.
