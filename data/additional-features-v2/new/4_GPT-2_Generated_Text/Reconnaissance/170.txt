KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's opposition is challenging the government's decision by the ruling coalition's foreign ministry to allow a foreign investment fund to operate here.
In a joint statement on Thursday issued by the chief secretary of the ministry of finance, Deputy Finance and Trade Minister Alexei Chiragabi, the opposition said it is seeking a foreign investment fund of over $1 billion ($1.6 billion).
The fund's chief executive, Goran Agassi, and five other foreign officials have been appointed by the coalition government to head the fund.
The coalition is also seeking from the foreign ministries, the Federal Election Commission and the Federal Election Commission to assist the fund in conducting the round of funding.
The fund is the result of a joint venture by the foreign officials and the investment fund's partner.
