Film Director: Joe Larkins
I am Joe Larkins. I am a composer/director, I am currently writing a new film entitled "The Wind of Their Day". I have two daughters in high school. My first son is dead and I am running out of money to fund myself and my daughter. I need the money to visit my daughter and the three of us. I have been told that some local media are now reporting that my family is out of the country. I am very glad and I want you to know that my family and I decided to move to the USA to start a business. We are seeking for a company in the USA to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that will enable us to invest in a business that is not only a business, but it also has a hook up to a particular foreign country.
