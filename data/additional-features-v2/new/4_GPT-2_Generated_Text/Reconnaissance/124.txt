The problem is, I am not the only one with the
problem.
I am the sole beneficiary of this money
and I have to be careful not to overpay.
I have a
interest of several hundred thousand
GUNS and I want to get this money for you
as soon as possible.
I am a Muslim who worked as a contractor for
the Government of Northern Nigeria for over 10 years.
I have to be absolutely careful not to overpay because I am
the sole beneficiary of this money.
I was the sole beneficiary of this money
in 1997 when the Government of Nigeria
assigned me the contract for the construction of a
new oil refinery in Nigeria's Petroleum Corporation.
I was the sole beneficiary of this money when the Nigeria
government awarded me 9.5 Million
$5,000,000.00!
I am now seeking your assistance in opening the
new oil and gas production facility
in Nigeria's Petroleum Corporation.
The project will be based on the principle of
redemption of the funds deposited for the construction of
the new oil & gas production facility.
I am in the process of seeking your assistance in
establishing a business relationship
with you.
I am seeking your assistance in the manner of my
responses.
We will discuss the situation in detail
on a future date when this money will be
transferred to you for your disposal.
I would also like to assure you, that the
UK Government is not responsible for any of this money.
I want you to know that this money is a
provisional
project that I have to make because I came to Nigeria to
provide the fund for the construction of a
new oil refinery. I have not been able to
take the money which I deposited with the Government of
Nigeria because of the Security Service of the
Government of Nigeria issued a security
assist certificate to me stating that this money was
paid for by the officer of security guard
office of the Government of Nigeria and that the
assistance of the Security Service is not required to fund the
project.
