AUSTIN, Texas -- Before he made his name in the civil service, Texas' top civil servant, Gen. George "Huge" McAfee, was told that he might be in danger of being executed without trial, because of his wealth.
So, he decided to offer a well-deserved compensation, one of many that he made available to the public, for his assistance regarding the repatriation of the money.
In a letter dated June 20, 2001, McAfee told his father, known as the "Billionaire," that he plans to donate all of his money to the United States government for eventual burial. The letter was dated July 4, 2003, and was sent to President Bush by his late father, the late General H. H. McAfee, the only surviving son of General General H. H. McAfee.
The letter is still in the possession of the U.S. government for security reasons, but the United States government has not decided whether or not to release it, which will be a major disservice to the country if the letter is not released.
McAfee, who was executed five days after he handed over the return money, is now waiting for the government to release it, and he plans to use his position to seek for an international relief for one of his family members.
"The death of my father was a major shock to me, for he was a former business partner of General H. H. McAfee. I had been a partner in his business for over a year. My father was imprisoned in the United States for the bombing of the United States. My father left behind a stockpile of money. I decided that I would use this wealth to help the Government of the United States of America to assist in the repatriation of this money.
I have decided to offer a well-deserved compensation to the United States government for my assistance regarding the repatriation of the money.
I hope that you will use this opportunity to assist me in my efforts to return this money as soon as possible. I also want to assure you that I will be of service to you in this regard and that you will be of assistance to me as I seek to assist you in your efforts to repatriate the money.
The United States Government, as the only surviving son of General H. H. McAfee, will not extradite my father to the United States for any offense, but I will also assure you that I will be of service and will be of assistance as I seek to assist you in your efforts to repatriate this money.
I hope that you will use this opportunity to assist me in my efforts to return this money.
