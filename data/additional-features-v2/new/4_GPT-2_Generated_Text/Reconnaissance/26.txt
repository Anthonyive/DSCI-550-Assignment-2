I wish to suggest that, because of their wealth, I should be allowed to own, in the name of the religion, one of the most important and the most important of all of the deceased, that I should take care of them as they are and should be my role models.

I will be taking care of some of the younger ones and I will be providing them with the necessary necessities of life.

I will also be providing them with a briefcase containing all required documents, documents for the transfer of the funds, and as soon as possible, a copy of your passport.

The reason for this is because both of you are in your 30s, and the younger ones are in their late 30s, and the older ones are in their late 40s.

At the same time, I want you to be of service to these two young ones as we will talk about the future and how to achieve that as soon as we reach a decision.

The other reason is that you are both quite old, and I look forward to you assisting me in this.

I want you to know that I am the most important person in my life.
