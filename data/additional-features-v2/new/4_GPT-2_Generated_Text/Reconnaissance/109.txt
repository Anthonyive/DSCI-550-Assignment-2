It was when I met Mr. Antoni Zangar, former president of the Republic of Nzhezim, that I decided to be the first person to receive the Republic's new Bankruptcy Certificate (BEC).The BEC is the original bank of Nzhezim where I deposited my money, then I deposited the money in a foreign bank account. I also have been working here for over a year now and am getting ready to travel to the country where I want to invest my funds. I have also been nominated by the Governor of Nzhezim as a special adviser to the NHE Bank, where I intend to invest my money.
My aim is to live in a life where I am able to deal with the foreign bank account or the foreign accounts of foreign clients. This will help me establish a better business relationship with foreign clients.
I have also been working for my former employer, the Bank of Nzhezim Bank in less than a year now and I am really grateful for your assistance. Please help me move forward in the business of investing my money in a foreign account which is safe and reliable.I hope that you will give me a chance to reach your family and friends.
I pray that this will enable me to invest my funds in the country where I want to invest my funds.
I want you to contact me to arrange a meeting to discuss this business and provide me with a safe and reliable business partner. I will look forward to receiving your reply.
Yours faithfully,
Antoni Zangar
President of the Republic of Nzhezim
