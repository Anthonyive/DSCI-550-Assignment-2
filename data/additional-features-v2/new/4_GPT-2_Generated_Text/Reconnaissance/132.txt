JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The European Union said on Friday that it has agreed to the United States and its partners to provide a 100 percent guarantee of the purchase of the $750 million (15.5 million U.S. dollars) of Africa's 7,000-year-old gold coins that is owned by the United States government.

The deal, which was made last week, also involves the United States and Britain, which is seeking to participate in the development of the country, and the United States government, which is seeking to fund the purchase of the gold.

Prime Minister Joseph Kabila, who has called for the United States to assist in the destruction of Africa's wealth, has said the United States would be the only beneficiary in the transaction because of its military service.

The chief executive of the United States oil company, Charles Munger, said on Friday he had also agreed to fund the purchase of the gold to fund efforts to rid Africa of its corruption and the black money.

The agreement, which was made last week, was made in cooperation with representatives from the United States and the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The agreement also covers the payment of the anticipated next of kin of the deceased and the fund will be based on the amount of the funds received by the United States government.

Kabila said that the money will be used to pay for the construction and maintenance of the 1,800-megawatt (5,000-hectare) Batana mine, which is in the management of the United States oil company Charles Munger.

"The fund will be used to provide security for the construction of the mine and the depreciation and repairs required of the software that is used to operate the mine. This fund will also be used to fund the acquisition of the remaining 10 percent of the fund in the United States, which will be used for a pro rata security fund fund to be used for the security of the assets of the United States government to be used by the government of Zimbabwe for the investment of the funds in the United States," Kabila said in a telephone interview.

During the period of the deal, the United States government has agreed to provide all necessary security and security services for the purchase of the gold, and also gives the whole amount of the money to Zimbabwe.

The deal, which was announced on Friday, was made in cooperation with representatives from the United States and the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

It is the first time that the United States has not agreed to the arrangement in the past.

Kabila said that the money will be used to pay for the construction and maintenance of the 1,800-megawatt (5,000-hectare) Batana mine, which is in the management of the United States oil company Charles Munger.<|endoftext|>A Quebec judge on Monday struck down a provincial civil code for the same use that is used for the military's use of force in Afghanistan.

Judge Robert Hart sent a letter to the minister of foreign affairs and foreign affairs of the province of Quebec threatening to withdraw the authorization for military operations in the country.

The court also imposed a fine of more than $15-million, including the cost of the court action and the shipping of the documents to the court of appeal.

The court also ordered that as soon as the matter is resolved, the minister of foreign affairs and foreign affairs will issue a new military authorization to the government to be used against the security forces of the country.
