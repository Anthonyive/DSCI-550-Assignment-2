LONG BEACH, TURKEY - IRELAND

This is the third day of my visit to Vietnam.
I was here to review investment plans for the government of the country in this country by my Vietnamese partner and my American partner, Mr. T. (Lance) Woods.
I have read some of the media articles that are from abroad that have been commissioned and commissioned by the contractors for the government of the country that is in this country.
We are looking for foreign persons to assist us in our review of these investments.
Since we were both in Vietnam, our mutual interest in the country is to negotiate in a confidential manner in which the foreign contractor will disclose to us the investment plans.
I am interested to hear from you about the terms and conditions that will be agreed upon.
I will also introduce you to the contract for the investment, which is currently in the custody of the contractor for the country that is in this country. Considering the nature of our relationship, I am prepared to assist you in this transaction.
I will also have the opportunity to hear your views on the relevant questions that I have to ask regarding this investment.
I am willing to assist you in any manner that can assist me in this transaction.
