Dear Sir,
I am Sir John Kostner, King of the Bulgarian Empire, Kingdom of Bohemia.
During the last period of the civil war, we were attacked by a group of bandits. We were attacked by a group of robbers. The robbers attacked us with the help of a Dutch shipping company. We were rescued from the robbers and were able to reach our family in Russia. I am the beneficiary of a sum of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 at the present time. I am also the beneficiary of a sum of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
I am also the beneficiary of a sum of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
I am also the beneficiary of a sum of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
I am also the beneficiary of a sum of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
I am now in the possession of a Swiss bank which is very well known. With the assistance of a Swiss bank I am able to secure my money for two reasons.
First, I want to transfer all the money to another country where our family can live comfortably. I also want to give you the full story of our efforts to achieve the long term prosperity of our country. My family has been living in the country for over 50 years, and I am now in the custody of a Swiss bank with a very good legal system.
I also want you to assist me in securing the full set of documents relating to the transaction which I am going to give you. I believe that this transaction will give us the confidence to invest the money in the country to which this money will be transferred.
Secondly, I want you to obtain a copy of our bank account which was taken over by our security company in the last six months of the civil war. I want you to also provide me with copies of all the documents which were deposited by the security company. I also want you to furnish me with your contact information for the return of our money to you, and I want you to enable me to establish a business relationship with you.
Thank you very much.
Best Regards,
Kostner
