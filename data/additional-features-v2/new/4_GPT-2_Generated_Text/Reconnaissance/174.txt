.
I got a call from a friend who is close to me. My partner and I were very well on our way to the hospital.I was stated to have cancer. I am still in shock from the terrible sutures we received.
As soon as I discovered this news, my partner and I got a telephone call from my partner. I was told that a super doctor in the and the hospitals had found my cancer, but he decided to not contact me because of the risk of the cancer.I immediately called my partner and said that I will call you immediately as soon as it is confirmed that I am a normal person. I am glad to hear from you. I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you.
Regards.
