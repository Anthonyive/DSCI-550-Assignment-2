As I said in a previous post, many of the major international bankers in this country have been excommunicated because of their failed dealings with the people. This is where you are going to help. I have been contacted by a close friend of mine who is a former Federal Secretary of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia who worked for the government of that country during the late 90's and early 2000's. Recently, he was in Switzerland and was one of the highest officials of that country. I have been in contact with the Federal Government of that country as well as the government of the United States and Europe. He has been told that he needs to transfer his money to a Swiss bank account to be used for the planned investment. I have been told that the money will be deposited in a foreign country where the United States and Europe are waiting for it to be invested. I don't want this to happen since I am not a business person. I am hoping that you will act as the intermediary between us and your country to assist me in this transaction and the funds will be deposited in your bank account.
I will also need your assistance to transfer the funds to a foreign country or also to the United Nations for safekeeping. I hope that you will not be denied your funds except through your decision.
I am seeking for a business partner who would be a very experienced financial planner who can assist me within this transaction. I will also need you to assist me in the preparation of a major investment project that would be a huge success. I want to tell you that my business partner is a 25 year old lawyer who has been in the business of law for over 10 years now. He is currently the Deputy Director of Management of the Federal Bank of Serbia. Before that he was a Federal Minister who also played a lot of political games. He is currently in Thailand where he is seeking asylum. I am seeking a business partner to assist me in the preparation of a major investment project that would be a huge success.

In the early days of the internet, the internet was a private, open access information service. One of the main concerns of governments and the internet was security in the internet.

The internet was a private, open access information service based on a common and reasonably agreed upon principle. However, with the advent of the internet, security has become the norm.

The internet is now a major source of information across the world. In a nutshell, security is the norm and security is based on good faith.

Security of the internet is such that if a website goes down in the internet and another goes up in the internet, then the internet is secure. However, if a website goes down, then security is not as good as it could be.

The internet has become a major source of information across the world which is why security is so important in the world.
