I don't know about you but when I got to know you I was so happy and surprised. One day I got a call from someone who said they had heard of the death of my father in the same year as the release from prison of a man from the republic of the Republic of Congo who was executed for the crimes he committed during the civil war of the late 1970s. I was told by my father that he was a man who would become a martyr for the people of Africa, but I was not convinced that he could be that man, because of my father's proclivity to kill or to do the same. I was told by my father that his death was in consequence of my father's proclivity to murder or to do the same. My father was killed by the dictator of the republic of the Republic of Congo who declared war on him. My father's death was due to the action of my father's countrymen in killing my father's family members and now I want to give you my full account of my father's death. I want to assure you that I will not disclose this information to you because of the risk of subjection of the media by my countrymen. I want to also assure you that the media will not use this information for any other purpose than to seize my actual wealth of money.
