The new owners of the company,

Tiffany W. Jones,

are suing me for using my company's name and the name of my former partner as an alias to back up my claims in this matter.

I have the following documents:

And the

customer's complaint,

copying the

filed by the complaint's

co-partner.

I am filing this suit based on the fact that my former partner was also murdered in this company's
shooting. The
company is now seeking a business in this country.

I am seeking a $50 million federal tax credit under the Federal
Federal Â 
Tax Code of 1986, which covers the death of the deceased
of the deceased co-partner.

I am seeking
to use this money to invest it
in a new company,
that will allow me to claim
privilege of ownership of the company.

The company has no intention of wasting this money.
The money will be used to "reinvest" the money into a new company that
will allow me to claim the risk of the money and the
risk of the business.

will allow me to claim the "benefits" of the money and the
