DETROIT (AP) â€” Michigan and New York officials are opposing plans to build a new railroad in Detroit that could carry freight through the city's industrial centers.

The project, which is under consideration by a joint venture between the state of Michigan and the United States Department of Transportation, was passed by a special session of the United States Congress last year that brought together leaders of the three major political parties, including President Barack Obama.

Officials in both states are opposed to the development of a new railroad in the city, which could carry freight through the city's industrial centers.

The proposal, first made public by the Detroit Free Press, would be for the new railroad to be built in the former industrial center of Detroit's city limits where the people live.

The proposal has been in the works for some time now, but at this point, no agreement has been reached.

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has said that it would have to decide if doing business in a foreign country is really in the national interest, and that it would be wise for the Federal Railroad Administration to examine foreign investments in the city.

But the FRA has not yet made a decision on the project.

The United States government has said that the project is in the national interest of the United States because of the military presence in the country.

A member of Congress from Michigan, Bruce Kline, said the proposal is not in the national interest of the United States, as the country is not interested in its involvement in the project's construction.

Mr. Kline said the Federal Railroad Administration has not thought through the logistics of the project, and that it would be wise to consider the project out of the public interest.

He said the Federal Railroad Administration has not made a decision on whether or not to proceed with the project, but has been looking into the possibility of foreign investment.

He said that if the Federal Railroad Administration is not able to locate foreign investors, then the Federal Government should immediately take over the project.

Mr. Kline said that if the Federal Government is not able to locate foreign investors, then the Federal Government should immediately take over the project, as they have the ability to operate the project in a foreign country.
