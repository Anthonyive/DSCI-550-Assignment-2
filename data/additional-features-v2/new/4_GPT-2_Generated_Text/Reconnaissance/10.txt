The world's largest oil and gas companies have agreed to merge with a fund under the control of the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) to fund their shared investment in development projects in the country.

The joint venture is expected to benefit from a total of $20 billion, with the rest to be used for investment in a variety of projects, including development of offshore oil and gas projects in the country.

The EIA, which accounts for about 25 percent of the total total money, plans to give the fund the ability to operate as a company and the rest for investment.

The money will be transferred to the fund's main account, the Central Bank of Iraq, which is set up by the country's central bank to manage the money.

The fund will also be able to invest the money in a variety of projects, including high-end residential, commercial and office projects in the country.

The fund will be used to fund housing projects, for roads, rail and other infrastructure projects in the country.

EIA President David P. Henderson said the deal was welcomed by all parties.

"The EIA is a unique global organization, with a vast amount of assistance and expertise in the field of oil and gas development in the Middle East and North Africa," he said in a statement. "However, the EIA is much less well-equipped than the international community to handle the funds, and will be a partner in that process.

"The arrangement of the funds to be transferred to the fund's main account is very good for both parties and we will continue to work closely with them to ensure a smooth transaction and a successful transfer of funds to the funds' intended beneficiary."

The fund will also enable the fund to invest in the development projects, including high-end residential, commercial and office projects in the country.
