KUWAIT (AP) â€” The Federal Government of President Abdus Salam El-Sisi was known to the world as the man who invented the internet and the Internet Act of 2000, but his reign of terror, assassination, and his death have been known to render him no longer a legitimate president.
The problem with this claim is that the public is not interested in hearing about his death because only the public knows the truth.
The president has been dead for five years, before he was arrested by the Federal Security Service in late January for corruption. He died in a plane crash on July 22 in the capital Abu Dhabi.
Since then, he has been beset by attacks from foreign policy-making, including from the United States and Russia.
US President Barack Obama tried to make his country the last Muslim-majority country in Europe, but the situation has become much worse since the last Arab-American president, Idriss Ba'ath, was assassinated in Nairobi after the death of his son.
The United States and Russia have made many attempts to acquire the rights to use his death as an excuse for a new Muslim-majority state, but the situation is now more or less in a deadlock.
Presidental rule, however, is in the hands of the military.
There is no legal basis for the military to use the death of a dictator as the reason for taking up arms against the civilian regime of a foreign power.
The government of President Abdus Salam El-Sisi has been known to be known to be in power since the time of Mohammed Muammar Gaddafi, who was still alive after he was killed by the US-backed rebels in Libya.
It is known that the regime of former dictator Mohammed Wani was under the influence of the military.
The military has been busy seeking a political solution to the crisis in the Middle East. The last government in the Middle East, the United States, was in power in 2001.
The US was the last foreign military ally to take on the role of the leading foreign policy power in the region. The United States effectively ran the country for five years in a foreign military coalition, now it is either under the influence of the military, or it is under the control of the government of a foreign power.
In this situation, the president is in the hands of the military.
The president has also been known to be a very influential person in the military.
He took over the presidency of the Republic of South Africa from the late dictator, Nelson Mandela.
Presidental authority is in the hands of the military.
