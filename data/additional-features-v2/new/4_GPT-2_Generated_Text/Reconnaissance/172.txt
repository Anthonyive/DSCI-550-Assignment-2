The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is seeking to hear from its South Florida office of counsel, seeking to establish a contract between the United States Government and the Federal Government on the release of $1.5m,000,000 in cash, money and other documents regarded as confidential by all relevant parties.The suit is still on the last day of the trial.
The suit is with the National Security Agency (NSA) which is seeking to seize all of the documents pertaining to the business, funds and accounts of a blacklisted company owned by American fugitive and whistleblower Edward Snowden. The suit seeks to establish a contract between the United States Government and the Federal Government on the release of the documents.
The contract involves payment of $1.5m,000,000 in cash, money and other documents, and the security and intelligence services of the United States Government.
The money is in a security deposit account in the United States Bank of the United States of America, and the security and intelligence services of the United States Government were in close contact with the original source of the funds.
The documents are in a security vault, and the security services in the United States Government were in close contact with the original source of the funds. The documents are looking for a safe haven in the United States for the money to be transferred to a safe source.
In the process, the United States Government has been in contact with the original source of the funds, and is now working with a private investment firm to secure the funds.
The United States Government is now in contact with the original source of the funds to secure the funds.
The government has also been able to secure the funds from the U.S. Bank of the United States of America, as well as the U.S. Government's security and intelligence services.
The United States Government is now also working to secure the funds from the U.S. Government's security and intelligence services.
The contract is now in the United States Government's custody.
This has been a very difficult situation for us, and we are now looking for a lawyer in South Florida to assist us in this deal.
Please contact us if you are interested in helping us secure the funds.
Regards,
ACLU
