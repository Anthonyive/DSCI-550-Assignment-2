K.C.<|endoftext|>The British Transportation and Infrastructure minister has said that the attempt by the government to clear the way for a direct takeover of the airline business is off the table.
Tunisia's minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, Dr Ali Ibrahim Othman, told a press conference in Tunis yesterday that the government had failed to meet its commitments to the fund and was now seeking to acquire an involvement in the government business.
Mr Othman said that the government has not received any application for a financial transaction of the sort that is required by the law of the land.
The minister said that the government has not been able to fulfill the procedures required to acquire an ownership interest in the airline business and that the foreign investment and investment for the services is wholly owned by the foreign operator, which is the owner of the company.
He said that the foreign investment is an engagement of mutual trust, and that the fund is not the sole business of the fund, but is made up of a number of companies which are in the process of acquiring capital equipment and other documents.
Mr Othman said that after careful consideration of the application by the foreign investment authority, the foreign investment is now ready and well.
The minister said that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has identified the foreign investment as a legitimate investment of the kind that can be made on the basis of the law and is ready to invest the funds.
