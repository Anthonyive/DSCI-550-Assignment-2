Sarajevo: The 5th President of Cuba

Sarajevo has been the Secretary-General of the International Solicitor, the world's largest private law firm in the country, and the 15th President of the Communist Republic of Cuba.

I am Mr. Josef M. Martín, President of the Socialist Republic of Cuba.
I have been asking you to assist me in the transfer of my assets and this money to a country not outside Cuba.
I have strongly advised you that I will be willing to accept this assistance.
My position is that all my co-operation and funds must be carried out within the terms and conditions of my position.
I want to know if you will not be willing to assist me in this transfer.
If you are not willing to assist me, I would appreciate it if you would not be a threat to my survival.
What I am asking for you to do is to go through with the transfer as soon as possible.
