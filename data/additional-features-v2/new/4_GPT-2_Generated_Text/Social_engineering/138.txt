I am the son of a 50 year old white man who worked as a security guard in a foreign country. I am a highly successful businessman, a well known politician and a foreman for a major oil and gas company in the country. My father worked as a security guard for the oil companies before he was killed in a shootout with police. My mother died from heart failure after she was murdered by a mob late in the day. My father is survived by four children, four of whom are in their late forties. My mother was a widow with three children who was kidnapped in 1999. I am looking for a well known business man and a well known political figure to assist in the search for my father. I are looking for a reliable and trustworthy person who will stand up for the interests of the people of Nigeria.

I was advised to look for a private lawyer who could assist me in locating and locating the oil and gas company in Nigeria. I am looking for a person who will assist me and my family and friends in due diligence to locate the oil and gas company. I also want to assist my family in securing a safe and legal position in getting the oil and gas company out of there. I have been told that this position is now at risk and my condition is deteriorating.
I am seeking political asylum in the United Kingdom where I will reside for my family and my friends. I have no papers and no documents. I have a very long way to go before I can present myself as the person who will be on the government's radar. I am not a business man and I am not claiming any of the economic benefits I got from my company. I only want the security and money to fight this fight. I am looking for a well known business man who will be willing to help me and my family out, as well as their families and friends. I am looking for someone who will be able to assist me and my family in locating and locating the oil and gas company in the country.
