The first time I have seen this guy I was totally amazed. He lived in India and there are some names that I have not seen before. He was a big customer, he made a lot of money from this business. He took the money back to India and then got his main place in a huge bank in India. He is a highly valued and highly regarded man, he was the sole owner of this thing. He died in India. I don't know if he is dead or alive, but I know he will pay the money back to India. He was a huge business man, he was the main benefactor of this business. I am told that he died in a car accident. I have no idea what kind of a family he was. This is a very sad story. I am looking forward to know more about the people and the business he was involved in. Till then I am going to be looking forward to discuss my business with you.
Sincerely,
Bertrand Vincent

As I said before, after all that has happened I will be unable to give you any more information on this business.
