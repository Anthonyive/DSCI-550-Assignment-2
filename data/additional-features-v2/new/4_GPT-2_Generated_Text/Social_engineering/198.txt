I have been looking forward to call you, and I am already looking forward to your reply to my correspondence. But as soon as I got your reply, I decided to take a risk that would enable me to obtain your full name and telephone number, and further help me to transfer the money to another country.
Please be assured that I will provide you with all necessary documents to assist me in this transaction, and that I will be in full trust of you.
Dear Sir,
I am Mr. and Mrs.S. Mihaly Csikszentmihaly Jokowi. I am the son of the late Mr. and Mrs.Nadezhda Csikszentmihaly, and I have both been arrested and charged with the murder of a child and the kidnapping of a minor. This criminal act and the child kidnapping are both highly regarded by both local and foreign governments. Furthermore, one of my employers, the late Mr. and Mrs.Yulia Zavlinsky, was arrested for her part in the kidnapping and the charges against her father were later handed over to the authorities.
Since the late Mr. and Mrs.Zavlinsky died, I decided to bring my family into the government government and to seek advice on how to proceed with this transaction. I immediately contacted your assent to this transaction, and I got your consent to take the risk of sending the money to another country with my co-conspirator who is not a foreign national, who is also looking forward to your support. I intend to give you a detailed budget and interest analysis of the transaction, and I will be contacting you for further assistance.
I have only recently moved from the US to the UK where I am not staying at home with my family, and the security forces there are very worried about the safety of my family, as they have been physically and mentally arrested and arrested for all these offences. My only son has been in jail for some time now, and he has not been able to explain himself in any way, to me.
I am contacting you to arrange for me to be transferred to another country where I can establish a stable and secure business with the security forces. This is a risky proposition, as the security forces have no reliable and trustworthy business partner, and have not been able to find one who can assist them in this transaction.
What is the contact you have with the security forces in China? You have not even been to China before?
I am sending you this urgent request. I have been in contact with the security forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo and they are looking forward to assist me through this transaction. I am looking forward to confirm your urgent and urgent consignment of the Money, and therefore your ability to supply me with the proper documents, and your willingness to assist me in this transaction, is a guarantee that this Money is safe and secure.
If you do not receive my urgent consignment within 24 hours, I will be contacting you again in a matter of hours to arrange for my immediate and complete transfer to the next of kin of every living person and the consignments of the Money to your house and home, and I will also be contacting you for further assistance.
Thanks for your willingness to assist me.
Regards,
Sally

Dear Sir,
I am Mrs.R.A.C.C.I.C, a former president of a mining company in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I am a 40 year old man with an eye for wealth who was killed by a group of rebels and their family members. I was born into a family of mining and mining companies. I ran into the family in the Democratic Republic of Congo where they were both killed by the rebels, and later my family lost all their gold and all their business to the rebels. My father got out of the country to seek out the wealth of a wealthy family in order to escape the labor of a corrupt government. I have been searching for money for some time, and I am not able to find any. I have been looking for a safe place to invest it and I am looking forward to it. I have been keeping a very confidential deposit box with the money in my father's name, in order to guarantee the safety of my family and my money.
At the end of the day I have no idea how my money will be used or whether I will ever be able to apply for a foreign partner. I have been in contact with a very reputable person who will be willing to assist me in this transaction, and he will also be willing to assist the family. I am going to apply for a permanent residence in Congo and transfer the money through the security of a company in your country that I have been selling my company for over 10 years.
I have a son who is a 20 year old who was killed by a group of rebels. He was subsequently rescued by the local government. He was then arrested
