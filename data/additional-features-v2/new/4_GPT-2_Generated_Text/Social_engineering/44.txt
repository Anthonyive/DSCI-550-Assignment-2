Yesterday I made a proposal to you as a client to invest your money in a company that will be able to provide for the underprivileged and 
wealthy (US$12 million) and the overworking not to be left behind (US$11.8 million). I am a minority owner of a private company and the amount of your investment is below a certain amount. The investment will also be directed to a fund which is not for 
profit but for the physical safety of the company. Till then I will be looking after you very well. You can contact me through this contact form.
Best Regards,
David H.
Dear Friend,
I have a question and desire to know why you would be interested in investing in a company that is not for 
profit. You have advised me to invest the money in a fund that is not for 
profit. I am afraid that if you do not answer this question I shall not be able to assist you. I have also advised you that if you are interested in investing in a fund that is not 
for 
profit, and have not said no to this query, I will not be able to assist you. I will only urge you that you do not expect me to invest in a fund that is not for 
profit.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon enough.
Best Regards,
David H.
