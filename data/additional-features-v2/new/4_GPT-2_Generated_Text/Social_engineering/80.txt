"This is a very important day for us, the people of Ghana. We are trying to bring you the president, son and I know that the tycoon and his family are from Ghana. And because of this we are now seeking your help to move us into a country where the blacks have their money and we will not have to pay the taxes, we will only have to move out the money. But this is not a bad deal. I am going to give you the money so that you can safely move to a position where the blacks and whites can live together. With the necessary help of God and human spirit we are going to move you out of this land. And this will include taking you to a church and the care of a black man. But we will also be willing to give you the full amount of the money. And we are going to give you the necessary documents to start your new life here in Ghana. But here in Nigeria, you should not be surprised if you are not very well. And if you are not able to reach us soon, we shall take you overseas with us. And if you are willing to help us move you to a safe place, then you are going to be a very good person. And we are going to keep you informed about everything that we are going to do there. But this is not a touristy country. And if you are not interested, then you can not contact us. And the only way to contact you is through our contact form on this website. And we will do our best to assist you in this endeavor.
And you can only contact us through this contact form. But be assured that we will not be called back into your country. Till then, we are waiting for your urgent and sincere interest.
"I am Joseph, son of the late Dr. Joseph T. T. Tait, a doctor and a minister in the tait family. In the late 1940's I met a white family who had given me a letter and a telephone contact address. I was told that I would be helping them find some money and that the black man was not going to be able to get a job. I said that I would not take any chances with the black man and will not give him any money. So I said that coming through you and the family with this letter and telephone contact is the only way to get support. And that is why I am asking for your help and your help to transfer the $37,500,000.00 (N.B.) to you with the condition that you will not give it to any black man in Ghana. I am appealing to you to enable me to give you the money. But first we must get you the money before we go into any of the above steps. And you only have to contact me through my contact form on this website for this purpose. So if you can not contact me through this contact form, then you can not contact me through this website. I am going to give you the following information to assist me, and I will not be contacting you through this contact form. You are going to need to call the black man and ask him if he will accept your proposal. And he will have to confirm that you are going to assist him. And you have to give me your full name, address, and telephone number. And you have to give this information to the black man as soon as you know more about the problem. And this is why I have asked you to come along and help me with this. And I expect to hear from you soon enough. And I will hope that you will respect my wishes and sincere gratitude for your assistance. And if you are willing to help me move the money out of Ghana, then you can only contact me through this contact form. But be assured that we will not be called back into your country. Till then, we are waiting for your urgent and sincere interest.
