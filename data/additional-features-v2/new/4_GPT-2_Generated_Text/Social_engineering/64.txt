Dear Friend,
As you can see from what we have seen of your correspondence regarding the business of One Nation, I have been unable to be more specific with your view on the business. I am not going to talk about the business, but the purpose of the business is to provide a service that is not only for the people in the country, but also for all the people of South Africa.
I am looking for a person who can assist us in getting the money, documents and other things for the purpose of investing the money, thus making it more profitable. I am not asking you to start a business in South Africa, but you can help us understand the business better.
I am looking for people who can provide a safe and secure place where I can invest the money where I can invest on my own. I also want you to be a good partner to assist me on finance.
Before we get further into the business, I want you to come forward with your name, your country of origin, and a phone phone number for all the people in the country.
I need your interest to come forward with the problem you are looking for. I want you to be a good partner to assist me, and I also want you to be seen as a person who can stand up to the rules and the law. I want you to be interested in helping us to cover the expenses of the money which I have inherited from my late husband(who died in a car accident) and have no intention of investing it.
I need your.
I want you to assist me in getting the money to all the people in the country. I also want you to be involved in the purchase of the land and equipment of our people. I want to give the money back to all the people in South African and Asia, including the people of this country, and I want you to work with me on this.
I want you to assist me on this.
All the people of South Africa, through your support, will go to fund the legal expenses which I have
