I was trying to learn how to shoot the camera when my husband got back from a mission to Kenya. He died in a car accident on his way to the hospital to be informed of the progress of the investigation. I was still on the phone to my late husband about the urgent need to give me a detailed account of the progress and the reasons for my husband's death. I told him that again, I was going to get you a detailed account for this urgent purpose. He said that I must be honest and be honest with you, so that you believe that I have not lied to you all this time.

This was before my husband died. This is why I am keeping all of this information very confidential.

God bless you and God bless you all.

So that you can contact you most assuredly in person so that we can all pray for your well being.

Best Regards.

MRS. MEANWHILES.

Best Regards

(Mr. Joseph)

I was looking forward to pray for you to come and accept my sincere desire to assist you in your search for a reliable and secure new husband and wife.
I have recently met a young man who has been searching for a reliable new husband and wife for over a year now.
I know that he will be willing to assist you in your search for a reliable new husband and wife. He is being assisted by a brother and a sister with whom we have an honest and warm relationship.
I have told you that we are looking forward to meet again. But you will not hear from us again. And if you do, we will not be sending you any money for the purpose of helping you out.
I am hoping that you will not be so idle. I am not expecting the money to be something that he gave you. I do not expect you to be in love with him. But I am going to ask you to show me your love and to give me the confidence to go to him and have my business done for.
And I have got some of the documents for you to look forward to use with the new husband. I have got some of the documents for you to look forward to use with the new husband.
