I'm trying to find a better way for you to use this app.
I can't provide you with a proper email address for this purpose.
I have a question that I want you to know about.
I am trying to stand out from the crowd in this app for this purpose.
I am asking you to be my representative and provide you with a legitimate email address that will help me to get you into contact with my team.
I want you to answer this question through simple and honest correspondence.
I want you to enable me to contact you through this contact as soon as you can, without any delay.
I want you to have a chance to contact me through this contact and by your response I can stand as the person who can be the first and only person to contact you through this contact.
I want you to be able to confirm that you are the one who can assist me in this purpose.
I also want you to know that this is not a partisan operation and that I am not looking for any political gain through this act.
I want you to be aware of the fact that this is not a political operation.
I am accepting your assistance to help me to stand as the person who can assist me in this purpose.
I want you to give me your contact information to further understand this purpose.
I will then be sending you a detailed mail with all the details of your social security number and the amount of your money.
This is the same information that will be needed to get you to donate the money.
I will also be contacting you through your email address to confirm the purpose of this transaction.
Sincerely yours,
Sasha.
