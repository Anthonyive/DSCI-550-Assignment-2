I got a letter from the first lady that said the following:

Dear Sir,

I am writing to you from the United States of America for assistance in getting your mother's real name. I have just finished a 20 day journey with my mother in Nigeria so that I can move out of the country to a more prosperous country. I know that you are now going through all this with your mother, and this is why I want you to be my next of kin. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested in assisting me.

This letter is directed to the following people who have said to me that they would like to assist me in getting my mother's true name. I will have a trusted representative and some contact with the people who have said to me that they will be willing to assist me to move out of Nigeria to a more prosperous country.

I hope that you will be able to assist me and your family in getting my mother's real name. I have made the decision that I will not forgo any further expenses.

I will then give the following to you as compensation for your assistance:

1. The name, address, and telephone number of the person who will be going to our home country for the purpose of obtaining your mother's real name.

2. Any amount in the amount of US$21,000,000.00

3. Any amount in excess of US$500,000.00

4. Any amount that is not less than US$20,000.00

5. Any sum that is not less than US$12,000.00

6. Money I will be sending you for your assistance.

I will also hand over my travel documents and money for your brief and to ensure that the goods and services I will be sending you are not lost in the transit of your arrival.

I have also decided to send you a letter detailing the name, address, and telephone of the person who will be going to our home country for the purpose of obtaining your mother's real name.

I am not asking you to be a billionaire, the fact that I am making this request to you shows that I have the confidence to do this. I know that you are going to be willing to assist me.

However, I am not asking you to be a millionaire, I am asking you to be willing to assist me.

I have decided to only invest the total of US$20,000,000.00 in your company in order to cover all the expenses that I will need.

I am willing to give you the private information of the company that you will invest in your company and any further information that is needed to ensure that the company will be successful.

May God bless you.

Sincerely yours,

[Excerpt:From the letter:]
Dear Sir,
Yes. I am writing to you to give you all the necessary documents to be able to move out of the country where I will not be able to move out of my family for fear of the company going into bankruptcy or any other financial problem.

I have been looking for you for the last few months to be my husband for some reason. I have not been able to find you for a long time. I have not even met you on the internet and I don't want you to get involved with the business because I don't want any more problems for you. I am not looking for a new partner as a result of my husband's death. I am looking to move out of Nigeria and I am looking for someone who will stand as my husband and be as honest as possible in their dealings with me. I am looking for someone who will not be afraid of the law and will not be afraid of what is going on in Nigeria.

I am looking for someone who will stand as my law partner and not be afraid of what is going on in Jomo Kenyatta.

I am also looking for someone who will stand as my son before I die. I have been looking for someone who will stand as my son before I die.

I have always been a loyal husband to my son. I have never lost a son or any child. I have always been a loyal husband to my son as well as my son's family. I have always been confident that my son will be a good husband.

I am asking you to be my husband before I die and I will pay you back for your help.

What I want you to do is to make sure that I will not be making any further investment in your country. I want you to be as honest as possible in your dealings with the people with whom I am currently going through this business with.

This going to be a very difficult business and I am going to need you to protect me and my son. You will be helping me with everything from my son's welfare to my son
