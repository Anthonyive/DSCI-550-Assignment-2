"I'm not going to start this game from scratch," she said. "This is my son's game. I want him to have a game that he can not do without me. I want him to be able to play this game with me. I don't want him to lose his mind on this game and want him to not be afraid to get involved in this game. We have to be careful with what we share. I don't want this game to be too risky for him to do. But I want him to know that there is no risk to doing so. I want him to know that he can invest the money properly into a game where he can not lose it. We will only be investing the money in a game that will be profitable for us. And that is why I will not start the game without you."
