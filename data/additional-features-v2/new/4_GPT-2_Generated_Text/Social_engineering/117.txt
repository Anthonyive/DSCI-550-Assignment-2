Beware: This is a very difficult story to tell.
I have met a man who has been in business for 14 years. He claimed to be a church minister, and that he was going to spend the rest of his life in the church. He claimed to be the son of the late N isa. In fact, he has only ever been in the church for a short time now. But he got this information when he was told that the son-in-law of a late N isa, who died a few few months ago, was a man of god, and was going to spend the rest of his life in a church. And I am not going to get into any further details, but I will just point out a fact. He claims that he has a son, and the son is the son of a late N isa, and the son died a few months ago, and then my son, who is now in jail, got back to me through a contact with the late N isa. And he said that I am going to spend most of my life in the church, and that he will never have a son. And that is why I said that this claim is dangerous. And I want you to be aware of this fact. And I want you to be aware of my son's fate, that is why I was afraid to give you this information. But before you do, I will want you to know that I am not going to sit back and do nothing, I will want you to know that I am not going to stand in any way with him, and that I have no interest in taking on any more of his business. I am going to tell you that this son is the son of a late N isa, and that he is going to spend the rest of his life in a church, where he will be called to the life of a god. And I am going to give you a very complete picture of the son. And this son is of a very high religious, and very poor family. And I will want you to know that I am not going to sit back and spend any more of your time, money, or lives and go to any of his business ventures. And I will want you to know that I am not going to go into any further details, and that I have no interest in taking on any more of his business. And this son is a very new person. And this is why I want you to know, that I have not got back to you, and that I have no more interest in taking on any more of his business ventures. So this is why I want you to be aware of this fact, that this man is an old man. And this is why I want you to be aware of this fact. And I want you to be aware of my son's fate, that is why I said that this claim is dangerous. And I want you to be aware of this fact. And I want you to be aware of the fact that I am not going to sit back and give you this information, that is why I told you that this man is not going to sit back and spend any more of your time, money, or lives, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money or life, money
