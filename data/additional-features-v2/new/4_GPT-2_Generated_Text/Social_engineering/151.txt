A police operation is under way in the town of Maitreya to trace "foreign fighters, for whom there is no charge, and to arrest as many of them as possible".
The 'foreign fighters' are suspected in a series of bombings and kidnappings in Maitreya, Ahmedabad and Pune, and have been threatened with arrest.
The plans are to bring back the foreign fighters, and claim the money or ship it to the country where they will be held.
The transacting company plans to charge a total of Rs. 100,000,000.00 (US$13,734,000.00) per transaction on the claim of the foreign fighters.
This sum is for the security and protection of the family.
The operation is under way under the hope of catching all the foreign fighters.
The claim is expected to be paid back by the beneficiary, after which we will search and re-arrange the money to bring them back to the country where they belong.
The money will then be deposited in a trust and kept for future use.
Money laundering
The foreign fighters are not known to be involved in money laundering.
I shall be contacting the relevant agencies for further details and if they respond, I shall be sending them a letter to send on this matter with your company name.
All that I have to say is that if you are willing to assist me, I shall be sending you a complete copy of the claim and the amount of the claim that you will claim as your beneficiary.
I hope to hear from you soon enough.
Cheers.
Yours faithfully,
Malayalam Nadu
