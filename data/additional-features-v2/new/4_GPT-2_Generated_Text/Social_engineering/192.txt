The latest in a series of significant developments in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria (also known as ISIS or ISIL), which include the brutal killing of over 20,000 people by the Nusra Front and the deaths of at least 20,000 others by the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.
In the past few days, ISIS occupation forces and the support of the US-led coalition forces (CENTCOM) have killed more than 20,000 people in the capital of the oil-rich northern province of Diyala.
This unprecedented killing raises the question of what are the implications of this latest development.
In a more or less unprovoked attack, I have been advised by senior security officials to evacuate the oil fields of Diyala to the private security companies in charge of managing the lucrative oil and gas industry in the area.
They are currently working with the oil and gas companies on securing the oil equipment with fixed investment and financing.
Finally, I am told the oil companies won't be able to guarantee the security of the oil field as a result of this new attack.
This is why I have decided to evacuate the oil fields of Diyala to the private security companies that handle the production of oil and gas in Diyala.
This move will help the government to further secure the oil industry in the area.
I have advised that in case of this incident, the oil companies and the security firms will not be able to guarantee security of the oil field as a result due to this new attack.
Finally, I am told that if this new attack happens, I will be back and I will be able to guarantee security of the oil field.
Sincerely yours,
