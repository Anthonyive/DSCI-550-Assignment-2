I don't know why you should keep this money for this purpose. So you can't give this money to anybody. I don't want you to give this money to anybody because they are going to be the only one left to take care of this money. I want all this money to be used as a way of life. You can call me to come and give you some details. I will want you to contact any number you may have. I will want you to contact any one that can help me with this matter. I hope that you will speak with any one that can help me further. I will also want you to contact any one that can assist me in any way. I hope that you will get to know each other better.

Re:Dear Friend,
I am Reza Al-Kabadi, a young man from the state of Hama who lives in the country of Saudi Arabia. I have recently decided to retire my life and family to avoid any potential conflicts or charges with my employers. I have decided to donate my remaining funds to the government of Saudi Arabia which is the only country that does not send out such consignment to foreign nationals. Before we move out of the country, I will want you to contact any one that can assist me further to enable me to further fund my family's expenses. I am asking that you please contact me through your contact below so that I may assist you.

I want you to only contact the people that can assist me further because they are not going to let me move out of the country without a finance arrangement. The reason why I want you to contact me is that I am the only person who can assist me with this transaction.
Also, I would like you to only contact me through your contact below to enable me to further fund my family's expenses.
I hope that you will only contact me through your contact below because of the fear that you may be harassed by my lawyers. I am afraid that the lawyers will not let me move out of the country without a finance arrangement.
