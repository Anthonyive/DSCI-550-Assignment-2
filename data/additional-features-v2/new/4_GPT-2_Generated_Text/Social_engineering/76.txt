The National Defense Authorization Act of 2004 (NDAA) (the "NDAA") (Public Law 104-71) prohibits the transfer of arms (including ammunition, but not all of them) to foreign governments and their allies and to any country without the co-operation of the United States Government.

It also prohibits any other transfer of such arms (except for certain military and civilian arms) or of their respective parts until the transfer of arms and parts is finished.

The Federal Government, through the National Defense Authorization Act of 2004 (NDAA), has approved this procedure.

This is a major step toward protecting the national security of the United States and our allies and their foreign partners.

My name is Robert F. Kennedy, the late President of the United States of America.

As I have stated during my political career, I have no intention of accepting a position as President of the United States of America.

I want to discuss my present relationship with you. I want you to be as loyal to me as the United States government is willing to give you.

Nevertheless, as I understand your interest, I will allow you to enter the private residence of my late husband, Robert F Kennedy. I will have a safe deposit of $1.5 million and an operational security deposit of $12.5 million under my Sir John F Kennedy, IMF. This security deposit will enable me to protect my assets and the investment fund.

I have also said that I want to invest in your country, with the assistance of a family member who is a refugee.

I hope to secure your acceptance within a few weeks.

As for the soon to be released from custody of the United States of America, I am awaiting your further assistance.

I will be contacting you to arrange a business transaction to obtain your assistance. The private residence of my late husband, Robert F. Kennedy will be the last place you will want to contact me before I move out of his country.

I will be contacting you to arrange for the transfer of all the arms and parts of your twenty three thousand dollars to be moved to a safe deposit in your name. This deposit will enable me to move your money to a safe country where it will be used to fund my estate.

I will be contacting you to advise you of the subsequent business transaction that will be required for your assistance.

I am looking forward to receive your help in securing an investment fund for my late husband.

Sincerely,

Robert F. Kennedy
