The St. Petersburg Times reported on Wednesday that the owner of the oil company in the Russian Federation, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is under arrest for his alleged involvement in the financing of the terrorist group for which I am the caretaker.

I am seeking your assistance to move the oil company out of Russia and into a foreign country, and I want you to consider the security of your decision.

Please have your name and phone numbers for me to contact you regarding my whereabouts and any further assistance that can help me bring this oil company to a foreign country in full knowledge of my relationship with the owner of the oil company.

I have received a lot of calls from people saying that they have no idea what they are doing and that they have no idea what to do with the money. But what they are really doing is paying the bills and they are due back.

I have sent you my letter with the intention of receiving your comment by the end of the day.

Please send you updates on my progress and my condition so that I can send you more details on my condition as well as my plans to move the oil company out of Russia for the safety and security of the family.

Sincerely yours,

I will proceed with the transaction in the interest of mutual trust.

What you are asking is the following.

1. To obtain the necessary documents so that I can be present in the place of the family and this will be done through a financial transaction;

2. To be paid by the family;

3. To have a safe place to live and move the money within the family,

4. To receive your reply to the above request.

I have no doubt that this will prove very fruitful and that it will be profitable for me to move out of Russia and into the safe house of my relatives, and this is my aim.

Please consider this as a compensation for the safety and security of the family. Please consider it as the only way to move the money out of Russia and into a foreign country that will protect the family.

Thanks-

Dr. Andrei Mikhajedov, the President of the Russian Federation.
