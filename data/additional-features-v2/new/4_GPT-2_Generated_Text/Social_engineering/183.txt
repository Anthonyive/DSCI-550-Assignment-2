I am looking forward to share a wonderful relationship with you, as this will give you the confidence to start business with me, without fear or favor.
As soon as you contact me on this email, I will send you a further update as soon as I have some more details.

REASON TO INVEST
I am looking forward to invest what we have in your company.
I am going to give you a percentage of the total investment you made in this company for the purpose of investing what you have in your company.
This percentage will be deposited in a trust fund that will be used to share between you and the family of the deceased.
I have decided that this investment will be for a good cause. I want you to give me your full names, telephone and fax number for the deposit.
Once this deposit is successful, I will ready you with the actual goods and services for your family to purchase, without delay.
I am willing to do this for a very reasonable fee, as I have said that I am looking forward to invest this money in your company.
Sincerely yours,
