I was looking forward to writing a letter to you on this issue, and while I appreciate your willingness to assist me in this regard, I must stress that I am not claiming that I am your legal representative. I am asking you to share with me all the necessary documents and information about your expenses that I require as a result of your assistance.
I am sending you this letter to be informed of the progress being made on the following related transactions.
I am contacting you through the following mail address:

So I have decided to share your information with the purpose of forming a business partnership with you for investment goods and services in the United States.
I am Mr. Robert L. Frisco Jr. I am the son of Mr. Robert L. Frisco Jr. a former security guard. Since I was a child, my father was killed by the US military and my mother was brutally murdered for her opposition to US military rule. My father was a major war criminal in the former Yugoslavia.
We decided to start this business together, but before he died I decided to purchase some arms and ammunition in the same country.
I am willing to give you a telephone contact to confirm my interest in purchasing these arms and ammunition for our family. I will also want you to keep a list of all the country's foreign exchange and banking contacts (including bank and bank officials) that I have with you.
In a way you can also contact me through the contact below.

So this transaction is for two million of Rupees. The money will be deposited in a trust that will be executed in the next five business days.
I have decided to move this transaction forward, because I know that this money will be used to invest in other investments that are not products of the a war that took place in Yugoslavia.
I am willing to accept your assistance to execute this transaction.
For now I will be your only person and only contact to assist you in this transaction. After I have executed the transaction, I will then present you with a certificate of deposit that states that the money will be deposited in the trust.
I am also willing to give you a telephone contact on the details of the transaction. And as you know, it is not my intention to give you out of nothing. But I am unsure as to your ability to handle this transaction.
So this is my humble proposal. I have decided to hold a meeting with you at your next of kin's residence to discuss this transaction and to discuss how to proceed.
I will also want you to give me a telephone contact to confirm my interest in purchasing these arms and ammunition for our family.
