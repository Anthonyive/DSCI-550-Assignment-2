This is the story of how I got the idea to send you the game. I made the game out of my own money where I have nothing to do with it. I have no one to share this money with.
I got the idea of sending you this game out of my own money because I have things that are very important to me that have not been done before. I decided to use this money to invest as a family, through a mutual fund. I want you to be the beneficiary of the fund so that I can invest this money into the progress of the game.
I know that you have all come forward because of your interest in this project. But why the wait... I cannot take this opportunity. I will not be able to invest this money into the development of the game because I am afraid that some bad guy will come to hold on to it. I will not be able to invest this money into the development of the game because I am afraid that there will be some bad guy that will come to hold on to it. How can I invest this money? I am going to need someone who will be willing to invest the money into a game that will be profitable for both of us.
I have also decided to finance my own car for now. This means that I will not be able to invest this money into the development of the game because of my fear that some bad guy will come to hold on to it. But I can guarantee that the game will be profitable for both of us.
For the love of God, you may be my only son. But I am in danger of losing my life because of this risk. So if you are willing to assist me with this business, I would be very grateful. And don't forget that I will give you a VERY small amount of money to invest into the game in your name. I will give you 2% of the total income of the game that you will invest into this game. And that amount will be returned into your country.
This is not a desperate situation. But it is seriously worrying because my son has not come out of hiding to the authorities because of his past. And this fear of what may come to come will not deter me from investing this money into the game in your name. You are my only son.
I don't want you to be afraid because I will not be able to invest this money into the development of the game because I am afraid that some bad guy will come to hold on to it. But I can guarantee that the game will be profitable for both of us.
Thanks again.
Yours faithfully,
Cecil C.
