Rabbi Shlomo Weitzman, a husband and father of two, has decided to end his life to bring the problem to a conclusion. He has decided to give all the money to a charity fund.All the profits will be given to a charity that can be relied upon by the family as the sole source of income. It is not possible to give back the money to a charity that is not there to help it, because there are no reliable reliable financial institutions to assist him in doing this. So he decided to donate the money to a charity that can be relied upon by the family as the sole source of income. But because of the huge amount of money that remains to be spent on both of us, we are unable to afford the expenses and to go through with the paperwork that will enable us to claim the full amount of the money. This is why we decided to bring this matter to a conclusion.The purpose of this letter is to tell you about the possibility that you can bring this matter to a conclusion with the help of a trustworthy financial institution that will guarantee that you get the full amount of the money as soon as you have the financial safety of mind to do so. You can also call on your government or private company or you can seek help from your friends and family in the area and they can assist you in bringing this matter to a conclusion.
