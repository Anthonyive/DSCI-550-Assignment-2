I said,
"No, I don't want you to catch me either. I will give you a full understanding of what I am going to do with you.
Please don't hesitate to call me after the encounter. I will be more or less on my way to you.
I will be sending you a letter of immediate reply from the company, that will include you and your attorney.
Please do not hesitate to call me as soon you have both received your reply.
Sincerely,
The Director of the Philippine State Bank
I am David C. Cotto, a former chief of the Philippine National Police, and I am currently in charge of the bank's support and security business in the Philippines.
I have been with the bank since the start of the uprising in mid-2012. After the successful attempts of the rebels to negotiate with us, we decided to deal with the security company.
Since my arrival, I have been the chief of the Philippine National Police in charge of security and the joint security and economic security, which we are now going to do on the condition that we do not be called on to do anything.
All things being equal, we have decided to fight to the death to protect your safety and security.
However, I have some financial problems. I want you to know that I am having a son in this very situation, and that I am not making a decision based on your condition and that I am not making a decision based on your danger. I am trying to avoid any trouble.
I want you to know that I have decided to seek your assistance to assist me in bringing this child into the custody of a foreign security company.
I have the backing of the U.S. Federal Government and the Ministry of National Security. I have also been referred to as the person who is trying to secure your assistance and security deposit to the purpose of either deposing the rebels, or to bring the children back to the country where they died.
I needed your assistance to bring this child into the custody of the security company so that the security company may proceed with the custody of the child.
Please kindly accept my sincere and sincere thanks for your assistance.
