A new innovation to speed up the development of the patent system was recently unveiled by the King of Switzerland, the son of the late King Arthur I of Spain. The idea is to treat this invention as a transfer of invention for a monetary payment for the services rendered by the company or persons, the product of which is not yet claimed.
The news of this development is going around the world which is why I decided to send you a confidential letter of proposal. I have been asking for your assistance in getting this proposal to be brought to you.
Please share this document with all interested parties, I will be sending you with a firm position to handle the case for this purpose.
Best Regards,
Charles K. K.
The Solicitor-General of the European Union
Dear Sir,
I am writing you to assist me in getting your involvement.
I am sending you this letter because I have been interested in the case of a company which claims the share of the one-fifth of the total by way of 20% of the total share capital allotted by the European Union.
This claim will be treated as a joint venture between the two companies.
I have a client who is a younger man who was formerly a lawyer from the late King Arthur I. He is now a businessman and I have to disclose that I have a client who is a highly sought after person who are highly valued. He is doing business in Europe where a lot of people are taking advantage of his success and this is why we have to go there to negotiate with your company. I am confident that with your assistance, this venture will be handled successfully. I am looking forward to send you as soon as possible with my documents that will enable me to officially claim this claim for the income from this transaction.
Before we proceed further, I want to assure you that I am not going to share your personal telephone or fax numbers with any company that might claim this claim. I am not going to do this for the financial benefit of any company that might claim this claim. I don't want any doubt or doubt. I want you to be as prepared as possible in this regard and to come forward with any new information.
I have an urgent need of a wealthy client who is going to represent us in this transaction. I am looking forward to invest the money with you to avoid any risk.
I am going to start with a very confidential and highly confidential transaction.
I will start out with a business transaction in the name of a wealthy man who is going to represent us in this transaction.
I will invest the money in a company which is in the name of a wealthy man who is going to represent us in this transaction.
I want to put this transaction to the test. I will be very clear on the condition that the key to the business transaction be deposited with the institution that will be the one to charge the fund.
Once I have done this I will give you all the necessary documents to prove your willingness to be the beneficiary of this fund.
I want you to have confidence that I am going to stand as the beneficiary of this fund and that I will be willing to go through the necessary security measures to prevent any breach of confidentiality. I want you to be as prepared as possible in this regard.
I have also asked you to move me to the country of your choice, to be your designated representative on the fund. I have also asked you to send me the relevant documents to prove your readiness to be the beneficiary of this fund.
Thank you.
