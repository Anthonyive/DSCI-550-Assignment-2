I have decided on this day as the day that I will start working there as a foreign partner. I only want you to be the first and only to help me to get married to you.So, I am going to write you a letter of proposal that will be forwarded to my husband to start the business of getting married to him here in Japan.So, I am going to give you this information to establish your interests and that you will be the next of kin of my husband.As you can see, I am looking for a foreigner who can do business in Japan, through a foreign partner, and to have children there in Japan. My husband is also a foreigner, who can do business in Japan through a foreign partner. I am asking you to be the last to assist me with this business.I am not asking you for money, I am asking you to assist me and my husband before we get married.We will have to talk about who will be the next of kin of this foreigner.

I will only want you to contribute the money to this purpose.I also want you to ask me if I will be willing to assist you in your money. I am going to consider all this carefully.I have always been a fan of foreign companies. I have seen that no matter how many times I have seen the same company in the past, they always seem to be either bankrupt or not doing very well. I have been following foreign companies for years and have never seen a one that didn't have some kind of problem. Yet, we have all been looking for a foreign partner to invest in this company, I am looking forward to do this. I don't want to be the only one who will invest. This money will be used to finance my business and I will be able to guarantee that the investment is not reflected on the company. I will be asking for a total of 100% of the funds deposited.I will also be willing to get the person to invest the remaining 20% of the funds in an international investment fund (I will call this fund "International Investment Fund"). The fund will be kept confidential and kept for the long term. I will be going through all this carefully so that I don't fall into any bad habits. I will not be buying anything from you that I don't need to know. I will be looking forward to use this money to fund my business and invest it in the companies that I will invest in.I will expect that you will not refuse to give me your contact information. I will be waiting for your response.I will also like you to contact me as soon as possible. I will be sending you this documents in USD$10,000,000.00 (USD$12,000,000.00) and the rest of the money in the Security deposit boxes.
