What I'm doing is researching a certain government agency, and it's looking for you to assist me in locating and taking back the money from the bank. I'm asking you to help me with this transaction, so that I can move on with my business.
I'm looking for someone who can assist me in getting this money out of the hands of the poor and needy, and save it for the future.
I'm not worried about my job security and safety, I want you to bring to this transaction a combined amount of US$35,000,000.00 USD with a $30,000,000,000.00 Treasury note.
I want to get the money out of the country so that I can move on with my business.
I will be contacting you through email immediately to confirm my interest, and to give you the details of the transaction. I want to know that you are open to helping me move this money out of this country safely.
Please be sure that you are a reliable business partner of the government that I will be contacting for assistance with this transaction.
Thanks and God Bless.
Yours,
A. S.

Dear Sir,
I'm Mr. Martin Farris. I have been by your email since I was looking forward to assist you in locating this money (with the assistance of a Government official) and want your assistance in locating this treasure. I'm writing to say that your willingness to assist me as you are able to assist me will enable me to enter into a contract that will guarantee a financial transaction that will enable me to invest this money in the future.
I don't want any problem to come before I have a contract with you and I require you to assist me through this transaction, so that the Government can pay the full amount and keep the funds for me.
I have a lot of friends who are of a certain age and they are getting ready to play for my advantage due to a serious illness. I've met with some of them to ask them to invest the money in a bank, so that they can invest the money with me. This is the only way I can make it through this transaction.
I've also been told that they will be willing to give me a percentage of the total amount invested. I want to be sure that this money will be a success for the people of the country, and that there is no risk involved in investing in this fund and I want the Government to be that person who will invest the money in the country.
