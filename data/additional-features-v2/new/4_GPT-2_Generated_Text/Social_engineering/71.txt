A large sum of money is deposited in a trust fund in Nigeria. The fund is claimed to be for a purpose which is to assist the fund owner, the Pakistani owner of the fund, in developing the contents of the fund to a certain amount.
When the funds are claimed, the fund owner, the Pakistani owner of the fund, and I will be the beneficiary, I will be the sole beneficiary of the sum.
When the funds are claimed, the fund owner, the Pakistani owner of the fund, and I will be the sole beneficiary, I will be the sole beneficiary of the sum.
When the funds are claimed, the fund owner, the Pakistani owner of the fund, and I will be the sole beneficiary, I will be the sole beneficiary of the sum.
When the funds are claimed, the fund owner, the Pakistani owner of the fund, and I will be the sole beneficiary, I will be the sole beneficiary of the sum.
When the funds are claimed, the fund owner, the Pakistani owner of the fund, and I will be the sole beneficiary, I will be the sole beneficiary of the sum.
The fund owner, the Pakistani owner of the fund, and I will be the sole beneficiary, I will be the sole beneficiary of the sum.
Once the fund is claimed, the fund owner, the Pakistani owner of the fund, and I will be the sole beneficiary, I will be the sole beneficiary of the sum.
Again and again, the fund owner, the Pakistani owner of the fund, and I will be the sole beneficiary, I will be the sole beneficiary of the sum.
I will be your private partner for the rest of your lives.
Thanks and God bless.
Yours in God,
