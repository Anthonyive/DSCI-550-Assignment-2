The only thing that is known to me so far about this case is that I am not interested in money. I am not seeking any money. I am seeking out a private company that will need six hundred thousand dollars to invest the funds (from my investment) in a way that will enable the people of this country to benefit.
I will be asking you to give me a personal telephone number, fax number, e-mail address and telephone and fax numbers for further action.
