L'Etat en el Sion de Cite.
I will show you that this is not about a business partnership. This is about a new business partnership between the Sion family and their partner.
This business partnership involves a new company with a new director who will be the new first householder.
This new company will be in charge of the new first householder and this is why the new first householder was named as the new first householder.
This new first householder will be the first person to step into this new business partnership. He will be the first person to assist me in this new business partnership.
This new first householder will be the first person who will be able to fund this new business partnership with all the necessary money.
This money will not be able to buy the new first householder's belongings and all the expenses.
I will then claim this money to the new first householder's house in France and we shall proceed to the next of kin.
This is why I decided to present you this letter.
I want you to be the next of kin of the late Sir Edmund and Sir William Woodard who died in a car crash.
They were both very wealthy and very well known the land and the air was very rich.
I am a 40 year old privateer who am not a high ranking government official. I also have a partner who is a retired General.
I am the son of Sir Charles Woodard. I was born in Laval, Belgium. I am the son of Sir Robert Woodard, who died in a car crash in St. Petersburg, Russia.
I have decided to become a country living Christian and consider myself to be a Christian, I want to be the next of kin of Sir William Woodard.
I am staying with a family that has been with me for around a year now. I want this to be the last time we ever go out together. I want this to be a very happy and happy time.
I am not looking forward to going back and forth in the United Kingdom. I am looking forward to be a foreign company that will not invest money overseas. I want to get out of all the financial and legal issues that have come their way and get this relationship officially concluded.
I am not looking forward to going back to the United Kingdom.
I want this relationship to last for as long as possible. I want this relationship to be a safe haven in a stable home where we can get the goods and services that we need. This is why I am asking you to bring this letter with you as soon as possible so that we can be sure that we are all in this together.
I will be contacting you as soon as possible to confirm your willingness to be a partner with me.
This letter will be directed to Sir William Woodard and I will be sending you this letter through a secure mail service, which I don't know how to use.
I hope that you will look after myself and your family as you are not going to go home without a funeral.
Best Regards,
