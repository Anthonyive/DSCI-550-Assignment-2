This is a story about the open relationship between the two of us.
I am a business owner from the Netherlands who worked with the late Michael Stegner in a major insurance company.
My wife is the chief executive officer of a major company.
I met him through my son who worked for a major insurer.
We decided to get a deal in order to invest the money in the country.
We have decided on the following terms:
1) The fund will be invested in a reputable company.
2) In the next 2 years we will get the money from the main beneficiary of the fund.
3) The fund will be paid in full to the beneficiary.
4) In the next 5 years a new owner will be selected to the fund.
The fund will be managed by a trust company backed by a private company which will pay the investee to invest the money in the country.
I want you to be as prepared as possible to invest this fund in your country.
I can guarantee you that this fund will be deposited with the beneficiary of the fund.
I will also give you the sum of the total amount invested in the fund.
This fund will be deposited with the beneficiary of the fund.
The fund will be decided by a group of people who will ensure that the beneficiary of this fund is compensated accordingly for his investment.
Please feel free to contact me if you need further assistance.
Thanks and happy company.

Dear Sir & MOM
I and my son have been married for 10 years and have a 10% shareholding in the Stegner Bank. We have always been in a position to invest funds with mutual funds and this position is not available on the internet. I do not know why the money was deposited with the beneficiary of the fund.
I am looking forward to help you find a suitable investment partner. I know that you will want to invest a sum of $20,000,000.00 USD in the Stegner Bank. (this sum will be deposited with the beneficiary of this fund).
I am asking you to help me and my son with this investment.
I have only one problem: I do not want to lose this money. I am not interested in any business that involves money deposit or investment. I want you to be as prepared as possible to invest this money in your country.
