AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- At a news conference after the Texas Senate voted Tuesday to confirm Sen. Ted Cruz's attorney general and pick for attorney general, Sen. Mike Lee said he wouldn't be surprised if the court of public opinion decided Cruz's trial would not go forward.
Karen Cannon, head of the Senate's legal services committee, told reporters that she wouldn't be surprised if the court of public opinion decided the Senate's decision.
"I don't know. I don't know. I'll be waiting for that to happen tomorrow after the Senate is gone," Cannon said. "I think it's going to be a very interesting trial."
She said she doesn't want to be late for trial because she's not going to be late for an attorney general trial.
The Senate's 5-4 decision to approve the nomination to be attorney general and pick attorney general is a big surprise to her.
She says she was worried about the delay in the confirmation of the attorney general because she's not going to be late for an attorney general trial.
So she said she's going to fight it out in a joint effort with my lawyer and I know you are going to be in the same boat. But I hope you will be ready for a quick response to your call.
My client is a former Texas State Trooper who died in a car accident in January. He was behind the main trunk of a U.S.-registered vehicle with the registration Star-Spangled Banner.
This was the first time I ever got a call from my client asking for a letter of recommendation from his government for bringing his son to the United States as a result of his accident.
I have carefully selected a person who understand the law and I will not be going into the states to get your son's resignation or a permit. But I will be contacting you with a total of 100% certainty before contacting you again.
This is my sincere hope that you will be able to handle it in your best interest.
My client is a free spirit, who has always been a diligent and kind person. He is a man with a lot of experience in law and the law. He has been a team player with the U.S. National Security Agency.
He has been the one who took over the Federal security office of the House of Representatives in the late 80s after the American Civil War (from the Democratic Party) and the opposition that led to the seizure of the U.S.-owned oil company (the oil company, also known as "Billion Dollar Baby") by the Iraqi government.
I am presently in charge of collecting all documents and money for my client. I will then go forward with the acquisition of all necessary equipment and the purchase of a new unbreakable contract to put this company out of business.
I will also be sending you a letter that will discuss the terms of the transaction and the exact amount of the money I will require to put out of business.
I want you to consider this as a very personal transaction, and I will be contacting you as soon as I have the necessary documents and money.
Thank you.
Best Regards.
