Following a successful search, the owner of the school, a well-known Christian, decided to move in with his son as a security firm.
However, it is not possible for any Christian to move in without permission from their bishop and this was the reason why he became the security firms owner.
When the church was here, the church's security was not strong enough as the security companies in charge of the church's security were unable to process the money.
This led to them leaving the church in search of new properties.
However, they did manage to land a couple of properties in the capital that are highly valued.
In fact, the owner of this property is currently on bail for charges of fraud in the money.
During their search, they discovered that all the security companies' records was not destroyed, only documents that contain the names of the security firms that are in charge of the church's security was destroyed.
All the documents that were destroyed were not the documents that were used to acquire the church's security.
As a result, nothing of value was left.
This means that the security firms have not been able to secure any money for the church's security since the owner of the church got out of the church.
This means that the church's security is not strong enough as the church's security company has not been able to secure any money for the church's security since the owner of the church got out of the church.
So, the church's security has not been able to secure any money for it since the owner of the church got out of the church.
So, I, Mr. CLAIMER,
claim that I am the owner of your property as security firm.
So, I am going to give you an assurance that the security companies will not be able to repossess my money or any of the other documents that contain the name or the church's security that are in charge of the church's security.
I will also be the beneficiary of the funds that you have deposited in the bank.
I will provide you with bank documents and instruct you to send me a letter through the mail with the stated reasons why the funds should not be repossessed.
So, if you are interested in this transaction, please contact me through the mail with the stated reasons why the funds should not be repossessed.
Thank you.
Mr., CLAIMER.
