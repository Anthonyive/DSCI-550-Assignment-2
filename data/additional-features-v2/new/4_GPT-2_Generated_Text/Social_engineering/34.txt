The government of al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden has released a video that shows a group of security personnel going back and forth between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban.
This is the first time that the government has issued a release of footage of this.
The video was released by the government of Afghanistan on top of a joint venture carried out by the IAF, the Ministry of Information and Research, the Ministry of Information and Research, the Ministry of Background Affairs and the Ministry of Security.
The security personnel are all Afghans. This is because the government of Afghanistan wants to have a foreign business partner to invest in the country. Consequently, the security firm is looking for foreign partners to invest in the country.
During the investigation of the security firm, they discovered that the foreign partners from the government of Afghanistan are not only also foreign to the country, but are also not even aware of their presence in the country.
The security company has also found out that the foreign partners are of a foreign country.
Therefore, they have decided to place them in a private security company.
This security company have decided to place the foreign partners on a security watch list for any information that might affect their business life in the country.
This is why they decided to have a special security watch list for the foreign partners and to ensure that they do not accumulate any money.
This is why they have decided to transfer all of the money to a private security firm.
This will ensure that the security firm does not have any potential for any problems.
All the documents that the security firm have sent to the foreign partners will be immediately released to the country.
This will also extend the security watch list to include all the relevant documents including all the company documents.
This will reduce the risk of any miscommunication with foreign partners.
This move is therefore very important to the security firm.
I have therefore decided to contact you to discuss the issue of this security watch list.
I am also asking you to contact the same representatives of the family in the country that the security firm have referred to.
With this in mind, I can only advise you to contact the same family in the country that the security firm referred to in the notice.
This means that the family will not be able to contact you until they have been contacted.
However, I am going to give you a strong and clear position on this matter. I am going to give you some really difficult and urgent questions to ask about this security watch list.
I am going to ask you to put your full name and the address of the security firm that they were looking for in the country that the security firm referred to.
I am going to ask you to send all the necessary documents to all the relevant organizations that will be the main targets of this security watch list.
I have also asked you to be your absolute and absolute partner in this security watch list.
This is because the family are in a very difficult position.
I am going to require your signature on all documents that I have directed you to send to all the relevant agencies that will be the main targets of this security watch list.
This gives you the absolute right to guarantee that the documents will be of the highest quality and that the documents contain every secret and relevant information that I have directed you to send to all the relevant agencies that will be the main targets of this security watch list.
This is why I am going to require you to present all your documents before the security firm that the security firm referred to in the notice to me.
