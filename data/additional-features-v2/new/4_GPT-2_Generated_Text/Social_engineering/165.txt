The American Civil Liberties Union of the Philippines (ACLU) said on Monday that it was joining with the United States government and other international organizations to bring to justice the 14 people who were executed by the Air Force of President Benigno Aquino III on 20 August, 2005.
The victims were Charles Carbonell, an Air Force pilot, and his wife, Mary Lou. Two of them, Charles Carbonell and Mary Lou, were murdered on 14 August 2005 in the presence of the President.
Charles Carbonell, who was under the age of 21 at the time of his death, was the son of former President Benigno Aquino III and his then wife, Mary Lou.
Charles Carbonell was also the son of former President Benigno Aquino, and his then wife, Mary Lou, the co-founder of Air Force One. Charles Carbonell died on the 14th of a heart attack during their flight.
The accusations of the United States involvement in the execution of the victims are based upon the statement of the president that he has decided that the country's death penalty will be applied to all the victims of the Air Force' killing of his son.
Charles Carbonell said that he and his father were in a political position that he was going to give all the money to his sister, but after the death of his wife, he decided to claim the remaining money. He said that he took the money to claim the younger sister, who is the son of former President Benigno Aquino III.
