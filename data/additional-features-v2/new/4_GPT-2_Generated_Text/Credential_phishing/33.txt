I am an active member of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. I had the opportunity to go to the Bank of Canada to invest in the offshore fund.
I got my share of the fund through a mutual fund arrangement with my partner. I am currently being sued by a foreign company for over-invoicing in the fund.
The fund was valued at $1.7 million,000.00 in Canada and since I was not a member of the fund, I did not have any choice but to seek a foreign partner to provide for the transaction.
The foreign partner is a deceased foreigner who was awarded a share of the fund by the Federal Reserve of Canada. He is a member of a foreign party in the transaction.
He was awarded a share of the fund by the Federal Reserve of Canada in the form of a credit for his service in the US military.
I am seeking a foreign partner to assist in the execution of the transaction by providing for the transfer of the fund.
However, I am now sued by a foreign country for over-invoicing in the fund. I am filing a claim over the money for the benefit of myself and my partner.
I am expecting that the fund will be released to me as a gift to my partner and we can invest it in our mutual fund.
I hope this will be of some use for you in your Ministry of Finance.
Thank you,
Mr.Yair Haji
