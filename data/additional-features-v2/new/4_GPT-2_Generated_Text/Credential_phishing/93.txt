A quick note to the people of the United Kingdom.
My name is Kendall Fischman, a former president of the Bank of England, and a member of Parliament, with whom I have a private business arrangement.
I am a member of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, and I am the co-chairman of the Committee on Financial Services.
My present position is that of the Director of the Central Bank of Iran. The next of kin of Mr. Fischman are the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the last of kin of Mr. Muzamur Fischman are the Directors of the Bank of Iran and the Bank of London.
My duties are to enable the Central Bank of Iran to obtain the necessary necessary documents for the safe transfer of the funds to your country of origin or country of residence in your country.
My country of origin is the kingdom of Iran, where the funds come from.
My country of residence is in your country of origin, as you can see in the information attached to my bank account.
I am here to enable you to protect the money immediately because I am a member of the committee, and hence I should not be allowed to get information about you from you, because I am an individual with no bank account and therefore I am not allowed to give you any information about me.
As I have decided to open the bank account of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in the Ministry of Finance and Housing, I am entitled to your best interest as a beneficiary of the funds.
The only fear that you have is that I will not be able to help you in the deal we are about to be involved in.
I intend to share the money with you as a shared claim for a share of your income from the sale of your country of origin.
If you will not provide me with the necessary documents for the transfer, I shall not be able to work with you to get it to your country of origin.
The money will be placed in a foreign bank account for safe keeping and transfer into your country.
I shall be able to give you the full details of the money as soon as possible.
If you will not reply, I shall not be able to contain myself in your hope of this transaction and shall be unable to give you any information about you, and the other beneficiaries of the money.
However, the funds will be put to good use as soon as you provide me with the necessary documents to transfer it to your country of origin.
All you need to do is to enable me to secure your cooperation to enable this transaction to be carried out.
From this information, I shall be able to put the money into your bank account and transfer it to your country of origin.
I shall be entitled to your share of the money and the maximum amount of the money will be paid to you through your bank account.
I shall also be entitled to your share of the total amount of the money and the maximum amount of the fund.
I shall be able to assist in the transfer of the money to your country of origin.
Please, help us reach this point by emailing us your personal telephone/fax number if you are interested in this transaction.
Please do not hesitate to contact me through our contact email address: david@sec.gov
