In October, 2003, a South African Airways flight with a civil code of conduct of $3.5m was forced into the ground by a disgruntled customer. The flight was scheduled for departure from Johannesburg and the Civil Aviation Authority of South Africa (CAASA) knew that the customer was a foreigner and had charged $3.5m for the flight. The civil code of conduct charges were kept for a period of seven years until the customer was discovered to have been a foreigner. The Civil Aviation Authority of South Africa (CAASA) has since been re-assigned to the civil code of conduct office. The civil code of conduct shall be reviewed to determine whether the customer was a foreigner or whether he is covered by the civil code of conduct laws.
