This is part two in our series on building a reliable VPN service.
We need your help to get this project started and funded.
We have a lot of information to share with you, so please,
please contact us before we move our money out.
Thanks for your cooperation,
Mr. Laurie.
We have a hard time.
In the course of our investigation of funds and services being transferred to our bank account,
we discovered a huge amount of money in one of our bank account,
which was used for transfer of funds to our bank account.
It has since been discovered that the money was for a fraudulent purpose
and that the money was for the next of kin.
Since it is a foreign account it is not possible for the bank to disclose the
account to us.
This is why we are asking for your help to get this
process started.
If you would be willing to assist us in the following ways:
1. You will be the one to provide to us with the huge amount of
the money, which will contain the next of kin information.
2. You will be willing to provide to us with a reliable and open
internet connection to enable us access the funds to the next of kin
of the deceased.
3. You will be willing to provide with a reliable and open
internet connection to enable us get the money out of the bank account
of your choice.
We will be contacting you via email as soon as possible.
Thanks for your cooperation,
Mr. Laurie.
Best Regards,
Mr. Laurie.
