I have been working with my colleagues at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the past few months to present the "development report" of the C.F.I. in London to a foreign body that will assist me in making the payment necessary to pay the contract awarded to me.
I have decided to start a non-profit organization (non-profit) to fund the construction of a new London airport with the assistance of London Asbury & St. James and other private companies that will be used for the construction of an airport in the capital.
I got a telephone call from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the 26th of May, 1999. I have been in contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to assist in the construction of a new London airport with the assistance of London Asbury & St. James and other private companies that will be used for the construction of an airport in the capital. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has been very strict about not giving any payment for the construction of the airport for several years now.
The contract is for a 10% share to be paid to the contractor for the construction of the airport.

However, as soon as I got the call from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the 26th of May, 1999, I immediately contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to find out whether or not a deal could be reached as to the amount of the payment required to pay the contractor.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has provided me with the relevant information about the construction of the airport.
I have decided that I will not invest the funds into a private company that will be used to sell the contract to other foreign corporations for the payment of the contract.
I have included all the information below into the contract.
The contract has been awarded with the approval of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
