My name is Pierre de Rocco.I am a retired French Embassy employee and I was tortured to death during an effort to locate and release the former Union Banker alive. I was in charge of the most senior executive branch in France and I have no other connections to present to you as my next of kin.I have a son with me.I am a businessman and have no other connections to present to you as my next of kin.
I am also a private citizen and am not a member of any country's top secret security commission.I am a former client of the French Government. In 2001 my client was murdered by my trusted colleagues-a man and a woman named Nachman Dupont-the person who murdered my client. My client was not a member of any country's top secret security commission and was not the only one who got away with it.
