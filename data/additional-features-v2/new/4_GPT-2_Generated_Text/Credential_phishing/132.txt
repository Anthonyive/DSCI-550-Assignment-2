Mr. Knowak is a former US Senator from Alaska. He is
a very hard-working man.
I am Dr. Derek Olsson, a retired US Army engineer
and he is the co-founder of the Black-Killed
Cape
[Cape of the North] which was the site of the
massacres of the South African Union (South Africa)
on April 1998.
The following is a brief summary of the enquiry which
was conducted into the death of Mr. Knowak by a
foreign company, the Black/Cape
of the North.
Eighteen years ago, I got a call from
my boss over the phone to advise that his company
which was involved in the murder of his
co-founder, Dr. Dr. Joseph F. Kippel, has been
deceased by a former Soviet head of state.
The company is owned by a company of private
officials who had recently been killed by
Russian troops. The company was so
dissatisfied with the life of its boss that he
was
asked to leave the country with his
company and his wife and children to seek
safe haven abroad.
I was told that the company that owns the
company has no relation to the deceased.
After looking into this matter, I was told by my boss
that he is a fraud who was murdered by someone
of his country's party in that
surprise attack on my company which was
considered to be a success by South Africa
Communist Party.
This is why I have decided to contact the
foreign company to claim this money as my own.
I want to hear from you as soon as possible.
Best regards,
Dr. Derek Olsson
