The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been accused of deliberately over-invoicing the value of certain U.S. Treasury bills (US$30.6 billion) that are due to be released from the Treasury.Since the end of World War II, the U.S. Treasury has been the payment provider for the Federal Reserve Bank of New South Wales (FDR) which is responsible for managing the country's Federal Reserve account. The U.S. Treasury has been accused of over-invoicing the value of the bills to the tune of US$30.6 billion, which has been released from the treasury of the Federal Reserve Bank of New South Wales (FDR).
The credit branch of FDR has been contacted to arrange the release of the bills to the overseas banking world. The bank is also transporting funds to the Ministry of Finance for deposit, which the central bank of Nigeria wants to transfer into International Transfer Fund (ITF) account of Nkandar Jima Bank in Nigeria.
The bank is also seeking payment for the bills that are due to be released to the overseas bank account of the U.S. Treasury, which has been involved in the over-invoicing of the bills.
The bank has also been accused of over-invoicing the amount of the bills and that was discovered by the central bank of Nigeria.
Therefore, the central bank of Nigeria has been notified that the funds will be released to the foreign bank account of Nkandar Jima Bank in Nigeria.
The central bank of Nigeria is in the process of establishing an account in Nkandar Jima Bank. The bank is also seeking payment for the bills that are due to be released to the foreign bank account of Nkandar Jima Bank in Nigeria.
All the bills will be transferable to a bank in Nigeria and sent abroad for payment to your account.
The bank has also been contacted to arrange for the release of the money to the overseas bank account of Nkandar Jima Bank in Nigeria.
I have the authority of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) (the Bank of Nigeria) to discuss the transfer of the funds to your account before the end of this year.
I want to inform you that the following is the matter that will be discussed between you and the Bank of Nigeria:
1) The names of all the bank branches whose accounts have been over-invoiced in the past year.
2) The percentage of the bills that have been released to your account.
3) The total amount of funds that will be released from the account.
So now that you have the information, we will discuss this matter as soon as possible.
Best Regards,
Dr. Marcus.
