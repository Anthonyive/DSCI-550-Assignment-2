We are going to meet next week at the first main conference of the second year of my family.
I was expecting to see you at the conference which has been planned for the next week.
However, my partner and I have not met yet and we are still waiting for your presence.
We are in a very sensitive business and in the interest of our business, we are going to close this meeting before the start of the next major event.
We need your assistance to get this matter resolved.
You can contact me by email at cmcclungs_@hotmail.com
I want to make my life easy for you.
It is my hope to assist you in your own business.
Kindly just contact me through my email address: mcclungs_emmy@mailbox.net
I will reply to you via my private email address.
Best regards,

The following is a copy of the letter that was sent to me by Mr. Joseph W. MacLeod and to Mr.Darryl C. Eny
from a confidential company in the United States that is running on the idea of using coal to power our homes.
We are a company operating in the U.S.A. We have a contract to provide a certain number of coal ash as a clear and safe deposit for the next of kin of a deceased US citizen.
The company is currently in the processing of an application for a non-profit non-profit authority to manage the assets of the coal ash as an unclaimed asset, both for the benefit of all parties involved and to enable us invest the money in the company.
We have to approve the transaction and require the approval of the fund's management committee.
The next of kin will be the beneficiary of the proposed coal ash and the non-profit authority will have to approve the transfer of the fund to the fund's account.
We are set on providing for your assistance in this transaction and we need your assistance to enable us to move forward without your assistance.
Please send me your contact information, but we will not be able to reach you before the end of the week
The next of kin will be the beneficiary of the fund.
This transaction was executed in accordance with the law of the territory of the country where the coal ash was deposited, but this does not apply to us.
We want to invest the fund in a foreign country where we can invest the money in a bank account where we can invest the money in the fund's fund.
This transaction is being conducted in accordance with the law of the territory of the country where the coal ash was deposited.
We are the beneficiaries of this deal.
We have a contract to supply the fund with coal ash as a clear and safe deposit for the next of kin to use for a new business venture.
The money is to be used as collateral for a share in the fund.
Can you assist us?
We are currently working in the United Nations Investment Office to withdraw the funds and to enable us to transfer it through the transfer of the fund to a foreign bank account where we can invest it.
Please send me your contact information and we will not be able to reach you before the end of the week.
Thanks,
