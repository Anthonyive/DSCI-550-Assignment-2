I am Robert V. Lee, and I am a member of the Southern Baptist Convention. The SBC has been a very successful business. I was informed by my colleagues that we are no longer in business with the SBC as we stand in the way of the eventual merger with AT&T. This was followed by a brief update from my colleagues, which I now share with them. I want to share this information with you because I have an optimistic idea of what might be possible with a business partnership and we want to be in better hands with the SBC.
I am seeking your assistance as I am the president of the SBC for the next year. I am in charge of all project management for the next year. I am going to be a part of the deal and help broker the merger with AT&T.
