The number of NPA members in the country.
Recently, we discovered a huge sum of money belonging to some well-connected person who was considered the
first member of the House of Representatives in Zimbabwe.
A number of members of the House of Representatives have filed
claims on behalf of the money. These claims have not been
successful and we are concerned that we may lose the money.
We are contacting you for your assistance in locating the money
so that you can seek legal protection from us in God's name.
Respectfully yours,
Mr. President.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am Mr. KLG Austin, a member of the House of Representatives
of the National Bank of Zimbabwe.
I am writing by telephone to request a confidential
letter from you as a representative of a foreigner
who may be a member of the House of Representatives of
the National Bank of Zimbabwe.
The debt will be paid to you by your foreign bank account.
This foreigner may not be a member of the House of Representatives
of the National Bank of Zimbabwe, and may not be a
partner of the person to whom the money is owed.
I am requesting that you be the
partner and beneficiary of the money, and I
would like to send it to you as a security deposit
in your country. I am seeking your
assent to assist us in locating the money, and that
will enable us to prosecute the claim
on the money.
I am using your company money as your personal account
and I need your consent to invest it in your country.
I hope that this transaction will enable you to assist us in
prohibiting the transfer of the money abroad.
Best regards,
Mr. President.
