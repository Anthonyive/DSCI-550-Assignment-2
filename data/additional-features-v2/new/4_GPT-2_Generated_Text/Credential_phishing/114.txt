I am looking for someone who has been involved in the payment of the FIFO bill to the Federal Government of Nigeria for the purpose of running a country bank account.
I want to be able to claim the money as a foreign fund to which I will be entitled in this country.
Since the end of the war in 1991, the Nigerian government has been running a bank account in this country with a huge amount of money.
It is because of a number of misdeeds by the Nigerian government that we have suffered through some of our most important civil wars in the past years.
I want someone to run this account and can claim the money as a foreign fund to which I will be entitled in this country.
I will also be required to turn over the account to the Federal Government of Nigeria for processing and deposit into account.
I have a limited amount of dollars, which I intend to use in my account to pay off debt owed to the government.
