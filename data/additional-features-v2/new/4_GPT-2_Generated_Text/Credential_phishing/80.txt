The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, has sent a letter to all 5,000 top officials in the Ministry of Finance and Housing (MHA) in Jakarta, Indonesia, informing them that they will be required to transfer to the Federal Reserve Bank of Jakarta, the Reserve Bank of Korea (ROK) of South Korea for transfer of funds.

The letter was sent to all top management of the Ministry of Finance and Housing, including the top officials of both ministries, as well as to the treasury ministry and the treasury department of ROK.

"We are contacting you to confirm that we can find a safe deposit account for you to invest your funds in (and) get your remittance to your country of origin," the letter stated.

The Ministry of Finance and Housing has not provided any details about the transfer of funds to the FED for transfer of funds to the Reserve Bank of South Korea, and hence the letter was sent to all concerned officials.

The letter concluded by stating that the funds will be transferred to the Reserve Bank of Korea for the repossession of the funds.

The FED will deposit the funds in a safe deposit box.

The FED is requesting for your cooperation to assist in the transfer of these funds to your country of origin.

Please be as patient as possible to receive your money.

The FED will not be subject to any transfer of funds to any other bank account until the transfer is processed, and the funds will be released to you as soon as the transfer is complete.

The FED will not be required to release the funds to you as your country of origin unless it is required to.
It is your responsibility to contact your top officials in both ministries for further details and assurance.
