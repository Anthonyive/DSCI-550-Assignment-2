Following the death of my colleague, I sat down with him to discuss the matter, and I believe that he has the necessary information to assist in this process.

I read your letter to me and I am trying to find your contact and a safe haven to relocate my relatives without fear of reprisals as the account is situated in the united states treasury.

I have seen you on your comms to claim your share of your share of the total amount of $300,000,000.00,000.00

The account in question is the US Treasury account OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL MEXICO (USAM), which was transferred to my name when the account was transferred from the treasury of the state of texas.

In regard to your communication I am not interested in your giving me your personal names or addresses. I want you to be your confidant as I want you taken care of as soon as possible.

I am contacting you through your contact form. My name is Cesar Noguera Sosa and I am the agent of a foreign investment firm, which we are involved in the transaction of which we decided to transfer the account of the USAM and its beneficiary, myself.

I have a very important business proposal for you to assist me in.

Please write to me before you send the following message to the above address:

cesar noguera.sosa@gmail.com
I want to hear from you as soon as possible.

Best regards

Cesar Noguera Sosa
Mr.My name is Cesar Noguera Sosa and I am a contract employee of Investment firm, who was involved in the transfer of the account of the USAM and beneficiary, myself.
The fund is out of the original deposit of the bank and had been frozen, with the deposit fund being withdrawn for us both to use as collateral for the fund. The bank claims this fund for our benefit.
My colleagues, my colleagues, my colleagues, our colleagues, our colleagues, and our colleagues, got the funds for us after we had moved the account out of the treasury of the state of texas.
We were told that we will be required to transfer the money to another country so that we may invest it with foreign money, that we may have the opportunity of investing it with the benefit of foreign creditors.
Our colleagues asked that we seek your assistance to repatriate the fund to the original bank in the country where we are now involved, if we can not find any successor for this fund.
We are of the opinion that the money will be held in an account in the name of the American citizens in the country where we are leaving.
If you are willing to assist me to repatriate this money to the original bank, I will pay you 100% of the sum as well as 100% for your assistance.
Best regards
Cesar Noguera Sosa
