So, I am a 40-year-old man, who lost his job and now I are in the position to provide for him, so he cannot stand in the way of the growth of my company.

My company, This South London Maternity Unit, is a small man's company, with over 100,000 members. We have an executive for whom we will serve as his company's guarantor.

I am not the only one who has lost his job. One of my colleagues, who is also a member of the executive committee of this company, was forced into retirement by a dupe of his boss over the name of this company.

I am the only one who got his money

by my colleagues in my company.

I have informed the prime minister that my situation

is not a good one for me to deal with.

I am wondering if you can assist me in
regarding this matter with me?

I will contact my colleagues to solicit your help.

Best regards,

Mr. Frank
