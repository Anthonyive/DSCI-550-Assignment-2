U.S. government officials are using the successful end of October meeting to plan a high-level possible U.S. government response to the Russian military intervention in Crimea.
The U.S. government is still holding the updated Annex to the U.S. Security Council Resolution, which is being readied for a response to the Russian incursion in Crimea. The top officials are still in the process of re-assuring the U.S. government that they will not allow this plan to become a political war of choice for the U.S. government.
With this new information, the officials are being used to make the necessary contacts to lay claim to the annexes.
The more they get, the more they fail to prepare for the full responsibility of the response.
