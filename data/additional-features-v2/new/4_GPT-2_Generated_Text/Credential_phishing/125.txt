I am the co-executive director of the Office of Equity and Access, which has been awarded a total of $15.5 million in contracts awarded in May 2010 by the Bank of Japan.
With the assistance of our partners in the Bank of Japan, we were able to get the contract awarded to us and we will now accept payment of the total contract cost.
The contract was awarded to us by the Bank of Japan in response to a request from our civil servant which I shall be using as the head of the Office of Equity and Access.

The contract awarded by the Bank of Japan, however, was never realised.
I was asked to assist in the execution of the contract through our partner banks.
I have been nominated to give a new contract to them for the transfer of the funds to the Bank of Japan.
I have seen no documentation that shows that the funds will be transferred to the Bank of Japan from my bank account.
I want you to forward the money to my partner banks as soon as possible.
Thank you.
