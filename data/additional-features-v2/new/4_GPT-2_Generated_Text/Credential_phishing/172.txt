I was on my way to finding a free call centre to get my printers and fax machines to handle the fax and faxes we were going to have.
My fax just under a week after I contacted you.
Your reply is the most sincereest of my heart. I am a dentist in a very poor area and I have to help you get your fax and fax machine to handle the fax and faxes. I am a foreigner so I will not provide any details.
Don't go through my website and email address without contacting me immediately. I hope this will be of use.
I hope this will be of use to you.
Thank you and God bless.
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,
I am Paul Madison, a retired civil servant from the U.S. Government. I am writing to inform you that I have just discovered a letter from a foreign leader who has been secretly running a long-running business in South Africa. The man's name is Pyotr Hameet Kwaite, a former president of the South African Banker's Association. The letter, which arrived in my mailboxes, was recently sent to my office in Durban, South Africa, which I had been expecting to receive for a long time now.
I was a civil servant in South Africa. I was in charge of the foreign relations department of the South African Banker's Association (SBA) from May 2010 to June 2011. I had been at the top of the ladder of the SBA, the biggest civil service bank in South Africa. I later lost my job as a civil servant for running a fraudulent business. Now, I am back on my feet, and I will be the next to go.
The SBA has a very strict ethics code, made up of strict codes and codes of conduct. These codes, which are so strict, that I had to leave my post, were put in place by a foreign company. They were a very easy and profitable business to run. I was the most senior civil servant in the SBA over the last 10 years, in the Department of Finance.
I was very close to the execution of this business but decided to seek the help of a foreign man to get a foreign bank account, and also to seek assistance from you, a foreigner.
I have been receiving this information from a foreign man who has been secretly running a long-running business in South Africa. He is an honest and talented man and I want to bring this information to you as soon as possible, so that you can be as informed as I am.
I am a US citizen, a civil servant in the U.S. Government, and I have been secretly running a business in South Africa since 1999. I was the top civil servant in the SBA from May 2010 to June 2011, and also the last of the top 10 civil servants in the South African Banker's Association.
I am a member of the Committee of Experts on Financial Reporting (CFRP) of the Federal Bank of South Africa (FBS). The Committee is run by my colleagues, who have been in charge of the CFRP for over 5 years. They are now in charge of drafting and drafting the CFRP law. The Committee has the necessary powers to propose and approve transactions to the Federal Bank of South Africa (FBS), which are carried out by them.
I want you to know that I am a retired civil servant from the U.S. Government who is running a business in South Africa which I had been expecting to receive for a long time now. I was a civil servant in South Africa, but now, I am back on my feet, and I will be the next to go.
