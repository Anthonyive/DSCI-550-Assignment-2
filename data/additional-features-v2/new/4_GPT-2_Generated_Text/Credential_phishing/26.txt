Ano Emanuele, president of the General Association for Senior Officers of the Federal Reserve System of South Africa (GSA) confirmed that $1.5 billion dollars were transferred to the Treasury Department in the account of GSA's Federal Reserve Bank of South Africa (FARSA).
"Based on our investigation, the Federal Reserve Bank of South Africa (FARSA) has stated that it will not accept any amount as payment for the transfer of a foreign contract deposit under the contract of deposit of the contractors and contractors of the contractors to the FOREIGN BANK OF FOREIGN ECONOMICS (FAMILY OF THE FOREIGN FOREIGN COMPANY) project
or contractors to the FAMILY OF THE FOREIGN COMPANY.
The document is to be deposited for collection of taxes. The U.S. Government has been instructed to take all necessary steps to ensure that the transaction is not for a political or religious interest.
The Government has agreed to pay all necessary bills for the collection of the funds.
We hope that it will be possible for us to claim the remaining balance of $1.5 billion dollars as payment for the construction of the FOREIGN BANK OF FOREIGN ECONOMICS (FAMILY OF THE FOREIGN COMPANY) project in South Africa, and that this money will be used for the benefit of the beneficiary.
Sincerely,
