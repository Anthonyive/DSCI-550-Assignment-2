The following is a list of foreign banks in North America
accruing $10.5 billion in foreign accounts.
The banking officials claim that it's the
holy grail of foreign companies, but with the
financial crisis and interest rate hikes that have been
taken
in the past few days, the US central bank has decided that they
have to get rid of all their foreign accounts
as they have not been open in the past.
I am contacting your bank for your assistance in this
further information.
Sincerely,
Dr.D.T.Yev
