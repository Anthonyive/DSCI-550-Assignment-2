I write this article on a remotely connected customer that I am going to contact through email.
He was a customer in a banking company that I have contacted for assistance to assist in the transfer of money to the customer bank account of his bank. This bank account is on the bank of the world. I contacted the customer bank of his bank and was told that the customer bank of his bank was moving money to the customer bank account of the bank of his bank.
I followed up on the email from the customer bank of his bank to get his telephone and fax numbers for us to talk about the transfer. I was told that if we don't reach an agreement, the money will be transferred to another bank of his choice.
This bank account is in San Diego, California. This bank is the second largest in the world. I am a customer of this bank. I will provide you with my full full name, address, telephone, fax and email address for the transfer. I will also share my credit/debit card numbers for the transfer.
The customer bank of his bank will have the funds transferred for us to use for the next of kin.
You should contact me through my email address:
