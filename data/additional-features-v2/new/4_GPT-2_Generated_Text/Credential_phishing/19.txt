The Russian Ministry of Finance is set to close all accounts of the auditing company that is the next of kin for the deceased, a French businessman who died on June 30, 2006 in Moscow, Russia.
The fund is to be declared bankrupt by the company, which we are not allowed to use to fund our own business. The bank will be dissolved, which will also mean we will need to transfer the money to another account. This money will be used to fund our own business.
We hope you will be a part of this transaction.
The fund is to be transferred to the fund management company of your choice, which will be the next of kin for the deceased.

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am a business partner for a mutual fund company in France.
The fund is awaiting its transfer to the fund management company of your choice, which will be the next of kin for the deceased. I am 48 years old and I am on my deathbed in a plane crash which occurred on 9/10/2006 in Paris.
The fund management company informed me that he is now deceased and that he has a valid bank account in France, which will allow him to use the fund for his own business.
I am very concerned about the fact that his fund is then being transferred to a foreign bank with foreign names and a foreign company as the next of kin. I am also concerned about the fact that his fund will be declared unprofitable, so that his account will be disbursed to us as your fund.
