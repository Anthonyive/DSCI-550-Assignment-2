The most influential political party in Europe has overstepped the line and discovered that it is necessary to control the money for a legitimate political party.

The money will be used for fund raising by the political parties for the next general election. The money will be placed with the official beneficiary of the fund, the president.

The money will be paid into the fund by the bank account of the beneficiary from which the funds are to be collected for the next general election.

The fund will be deposited into your account for the purpose of receiving the fund for your use.

You may ask about the nature of this money as the fund is for your benefit.

My question is, is this money for personal use or for political gain?

I am Mr. Mr. Adrian Kaldus, a member of a foreign political party.
I agree with you that this money should be safe for political use.
However, I need your help to fully fund this fund.
I hope you will be as kind as I am.
Best, Mr. Adrian Kaldus
