"I am Sir Robert M. Brown, a member of the Committee on Foreign Investment of the United Kingdom Government and the Director General of the Department for International Development. He is an officer of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which made World Bank's investment guarantees and accounts for the victims of World War II.
"The Department for International Development is the country that is most closely connected to the bank, and has been for decades.
"Following World War II, foreign banks which had been opened for sale failed to start their investments.
"This is because the bank was state sponsored. The bank was eventually made into an investment fund by the government of France, repaying interest.
"The bank is now being used as a great fund to finance the transfer of the foreign accounts of the victims of World War II to the next of kin.
"The bank is still operated by the bank's original directors and accountants, who have been removed.
"The beneficiary of this fund is a beneficiary of the bank's original director.
"The beneficiary of this fund is also the beneficiary of the bank's original accountants.
"This fund is being used as an investment fund for the transfer of the funds from the bank to the next of kin of the victims of World War II.
"When the funds are transferred, the fund shall be paid to the beneficiary of the fund.
"My committee is also interested in your assistance to assist this fund, and our country.
