The names of the victims of the blast at London Bridge have been released and we will be providing them with the first details of the next of kin to be identified.
It also is my hope that we can gain enough information to identify and locate the next of kin for the five victims.
I am going to seek outside assistance to assist in the transfer of the money to my country.
I am only 13 years old and am married to a man I met in London. It was during a business trip that I met with some foreign officials and in return they said to me that they are willing to assist me in the transfer of the money to my country.
I have been working as a consultant with the Bank of England for a number of years now, with the assistance of a number of senior officials. The course of action for the transfer of the money in the banking system has been set up by the Bank. I have been very interested in this business and am still waiting for my next of kin.
I hope that you will share this information with me so that we can make a smooth transaction and enable this money to be transferred to your country.
If you are willing to donate this money to us, you will be helping to facilitate this transaction.
It is easy to hear the fear and anticipation in the hearts of the people of London as we are still in a very dark time and are still going through a very difficult time.
I want to discourage you to think that this money is for just one person and that they are not for all of us. I want you to be patient with me and wait for the next of kin to be identified.
I want to pray for your confidence in the efforts of this man.
Best Regards,
Dr.Rajana Omid
