I understand that the Government of Canada may be taking a great deal of stock in a company that is not ours, but I am not a member of it. I stand by my claim as a Canadian. I am not a member of the Company, but I am a member of the foreign company. I stand by the fact that my personal relationship with Mr. Isri was not compromised. I stand by the fact that he took his utmost care to ensure that the business is done in good faith.
I pray for you to be more by your side by contacting me and my representative here in Ottawa.
Thank you,
Mr._Mr_Mr_Mr.
