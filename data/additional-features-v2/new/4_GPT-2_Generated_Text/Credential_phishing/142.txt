Shout out to my co-worker in the Department of Private Finance and Housing, Mr. Weitein, who has written me to inform you that his company in the GDR, a private investment fund, has been discovered to be under the control of the Russian Central Bank of the central bank of Russia, the Bank of Russia, Russia Central Bank, which has been operating for some years now in the country. He knows that the money is intended for payment of debts incurred by the Bank and not for investment purposes but is concerned with the prompt transfer of the funds to your country bank account.
I am Mr. Weitein, a member of the Committee of an Independent Committee of an Independent Banker (CIJEC), the Committee of an independent banker (CIJEC) which is headed by a French-born banker named Pierre-Joseph Bévary, a foreign investment fund manager for which he was charged with the responsibility of the original award of a total of US$14.5 billion.
The Committee of an Independent Committee of an Independent Banker (CIJEC) was the body that nominated for the prestigious Citibank Award in 2003. It has since been approved by the Federal Reserve of North America and the Swiss Federal Bank, and is now being operated by the company which awarded the award.
However, the Committee of an Independent Committee of an Independent Banker (CIJEC) has decided that the money is for investment purposes rather than for foreign payment of debts incurred by the Bank.
I have been instructed by my co-worker Mr. Weitein to contact you and inform you that the bank has been discovered to be under the control of the Russian Central Bank of the central bank of Russia, the Bank of Russia, Russia Central Bank, which has been operating for some years now in the country.
