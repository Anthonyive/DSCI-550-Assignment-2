A private company based in Cairo, Egypt, has defied the authority of the armed forces with a proposal to transfer a total of $20million to the treasury of Egypt, which the government has not agreed to give in payment for years to come.

The total amount of money has been transferred to a foreign bank account of the company (Cairo Bank).

The total sum of $20million is the share of the total sum into which it was transferred.

The bank has a section of the money for its own use.

The private company will have to present carefully approved reports to the treasury of Egypt to ensure that the money is transferred to the treasury of Egypt.

The bank will be the only beneficiary of the transfer of the total amount and will then be entitled to receive the money, if it is not returned to the bank for verification.

The bank will be required to send a certified copy of the required documents to the bank in Cairo, where they will be forwarded to the director of the bank.

The CEO and the general manager of the private company will also be required to present a proof of claim for the sum.
