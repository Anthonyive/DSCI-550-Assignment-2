The US government has ordered that all express and foreign mail sent to the US by foreign citizens that are non-governmental organizations, or foreign donations, be confiscated to be sent to US banks.
It's been declared the law of the land by US President Obama.
The letter dated January 8, 2014, by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) which is a body that is working on the ethics of foreign government officials, is now being paid to the bank that shall handle the funds.
The letter states that the money will be handed over to the Federal Reserve of New York (F.R.N.E.) for processing.
The bank will be required to send you a certificate of deposit by fax if you want to add your name to the list of beneficiaries.
I hope you understand. I hope this letter serves as a warning to all but the most uninterested of foreign politicians.
May God bless you all.
