This is a huge blessing to me, as the man who discovered the whole body of the mail coming from Indonesia and has since died in the hand of the late Sultan Abacha. I am really grateful to you for so much of this money.
I am also very grateful to you for your efforts in account of this money.
I hope that you will be as humble as I am for making this sacrifice on your behalf.
The next of kin will be the holder of the money.
Thank you for your cooperation and for your willingness to assist me.
Sincerely,
Arun Agarwal.
