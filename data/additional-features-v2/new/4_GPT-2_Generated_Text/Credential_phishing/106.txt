The government of Bangladesh has agreed to pay $15 million to an organisation that is involved in a project to build a new triple-decker bus in Ahmedabad, the capital of central Nairobi, for a medical school.

The project is being led by a foreign contractor with a contract to run the bus in Africa.

The project has been a success though it has been put on hold for now.

The company in question is seeking to open the site for economic development in the name of the cause of the bus.

Based on the hope that the project will be profitable, the contract was awarded to the company for construction of a bus that will be possible to carry passengers to Europe with a capacity of up to 10,000 passengers.

The company is now in the process of finding a new contractor to give the loan, as this is a foreign contract, but we are also seeking to find a partner.

If you are interested in the matter, you can contact us via email at: btato@aol.com

Please note that the funds will be paid to the official account of the government of Bangladesh.

We will need your help to fund the bus to be carried to Europe, and we need your support to fund the operation of this project in Africa.

I have a problem with you.

I want you to know that your money will be used for security and charity work.
However, you are not to help us.
This will be paid to you by the company for the day of the transfer.
