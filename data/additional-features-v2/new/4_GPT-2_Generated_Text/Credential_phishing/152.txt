"The week of December 14, 2003, was a very sad day for the world! It was a late meeting in the Temple of Marduk in Dubai. I had been assigned to watch the ceremony , which was to discuss the use of the government fund for financing the construction of a new state-owned building in the capital of Kuwait. The proposal was that if I had not made the necessary arrangements, the course of the project might have been delayed by several months. The only hope I had was to provide for myself to my partner in the project.

As we were leaving, they told me that the reason for my leaving was that they had decided to withdraw the fund from my account, which I had until this time not been allowed access to. I decided to seek safe-haven in the U.S. for my partner, who is now in the custody of the U.S. government for his role in the financing of the construction of this building .

I have the utmost confidence in you to assist me in the deal."

In a letter dated December 14, 2003 which was still in the custody of the U.S. Government, the foreign minister wrote me this letter:

"Dear Sir/Madam,

I have a client under contract to assist you here in the foreign government investment fund.

The fund is to be used for the construction of an international airport in the Central Bank of Kuwait.

I am looking for someone who can assist me. I am from Kuwait.

The fund has been awarded to me by the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIAA) for the construction of the international airport.
I have the utmost confidence in you to assist me in the deal.

I am writing this letter to you so that you can move the fund to a safe deposit box in your country which will be safe for the transfer of the fund to your country.
I hope that you will not disappoint me.
I am a foreigner in Kuwait, and have no bank account in Kuwait and therefore no need to seek for a foreigner to assist me in the deal.
You will provide me with the necessary information to bring you on board to invest the fund in your country.
I will only seek a foreigner in your country where you can transfer the fund to your country.
I am faxing you your contact information and telephone number so that you can contact me if you need any information about this deal.
Please contact me through my contact list or through my email address: hcabac@hassn.com
Best regards,
C. The foreign minister sent me this letter to indicate to you that this deal is final and I am not interested in a relationship with foreign officials.
You can read more about this deal from my more in depth blog with more details for you.

Sincerely,
C.

Thank you for your interest in receiving this letter.
All that I need you to do is send me your contact information and telephone number so that I can contact you through my contact list or through my email address: hcabac@hassn.com
