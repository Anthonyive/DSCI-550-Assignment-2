I was hoping the 20th would be a great time for you to come visit me and get the help to get this proposal through the Federal Government.
However, we are still not expecting your help to get through this Government.
My wife is in a foreign country that has no funds or banking arrangement. And I want you to assist me with this transaction so that we can have the funds back in our country without any hitch.
I want to say again, the government of your country is very sensitive to your interest. I need a foreigner who knows about this project to help me get the funds
through this Government.
Sincerely,
Federico M. Bonaventura
I, my wife and I
I am a customer of the Bank of America of America (BAC),
which is the world's largest foreign bank. I am
currently visiting my old friend,
Mr. General James T. Walker. He is
a member of the U.S. Army Reserve Forces
and a member of the United States Air Force Reserve
Facts. He was a top official with the
air force during the Korean War. I am
in the Finance Department of the Bank of America
with Mr. General Walker
which is involved in the construction of the EY
index
bank. The Bank also has a branch in
South Korea. In the late 60s, a former officer
was sentenced to death for the murder
of a foreign officer. He was a former
soldier in the national guard of South
America. This former officer was a
soldier in the national guard of South
America. I am very interested in this transaction because
I am a foreigner so I want you to help me with this
project.
Please kindly share this message via email to ensure that I get
close to you.
Best Regards,
James T.Walker
