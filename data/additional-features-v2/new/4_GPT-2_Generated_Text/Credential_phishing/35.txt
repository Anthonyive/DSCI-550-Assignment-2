Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Mr.David Madani, a 30 year old Indonesian. My son was born in a orphanage in Kandy, Indonesia, a country that has been the site of the biggest mass famine in world history. I discovered that he was orphaned at the time he was born.
The orphanage was owned by the church of Kandy, which was the official custodian of the orphanage.
The orphanage's property was looted by the armed forces. The church of Kandy was also the official custodian of the orphanage and the site of the main disaster that broke out in the late late 1960s/early 1970s.
The church of Kandy had been a major beneficiary of the church's money in the late 1960s/early 1970s. I was very interested in the story of my son but unfortunately it has been abandoned. I am going to send you this letter to tell you that this money has been surrendered to our country and we have no other idea but to help you out in your life.
I want you to be my servant. I want you to be my daughter.
I want you to be my daughter.
Do not hesitate to contact me here with this information.
I can tell you everything you need to help me.
Best regards
Mr.M.D.
