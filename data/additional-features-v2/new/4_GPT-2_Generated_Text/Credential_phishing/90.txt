I am writing a letter to you, a foreigner, who has been suspected of involvement with the scam. This foreigner is a foreigner who is under investigation, and has not opened an account in the Financial Conduct Authority of the Bank of Nigeria (FPC) that he is connected to. My main interest is that this foreigner will not be able to clear his name and remit his money to a bank account in Nigeria, and to get his share of the total wealth. This would be my opportunity to claim the share as part of my share, provided that he does not apply to the original bank bank, and does not claim any share.
I am writing to tell you that in the course of investigation of the matter that is going on between you and this foreigner, I have discovered that he is a foreigner who has been charged with over-invoicing and transfer of foreign bills into his bank account. The bank and the FPC President have decided that the money will be sent back to him and that he should be released to his country where he will receive the total sum of $5.5million.
I want you to carry this letter out to the fullest extent of my power and to enable me to reach you with your cooperation. I need your assurance that the matter will be dealt with with utmost secrecy, as no one outside the bank and FPC President will be involved.
I am writing you to seek your assistance in transferring the money to your account in the Bank of Nigeria that you are being investigated for.
Finally, if you are willing to assist me in this effort, I can accept your application in my name.
Best regards,
Bella B.
Dear Friend,
I am here to offer you this letter because the problem is that I am not able to send you money to your account in the Bank of Nigeria.
I have been told by the FPC president that this money will be sent to your account in your account in the bank that this foreign money was transferred to.
My main reason is that this money is going into your account and is going to be in your name for your benefit. I believe you will assist me in this transaction for my own benefit.
I am afraid that your mother will not want to hear about this matter because this matter has got so much attention in the country so far. I will be contacting you with your assistance and help to get this money into your account.
I want to advise you that this money is not safe for your country and that you should not send this money to any foreign account in your country or attach it to any foreign account.
