I am a solid, highly-qualified, highly-placed person, who has a very strong and abiding relationship with the president of the Republic of Zimbabwe, who was also head of state of South Africa from 2002 to 2003. I do not want to betray my influence and security.
President Obama and his officials should be absolutely held responsible for this. The only thing that I want to do is to release this information to you, the concerned parties, in the best interests of the country and of course you will be the beneficiary of this information. This has been the most urgent and successful effort to get this information out to you.
Please give me your full name, telephone/fax/fax, and address so that I can arrange for you to contact me so that I can have this information for you to use for a legitimate business transaction.
Sincerely,
Mr President,
Mr Vice President, Ms Ms Sister Sister
Thank you for your prompt response to this matter.
Mr President,
Mr President, Ms Sister Sister
Please, I am very sorry to hear that your company does not have a contract with you in this business.
I was the last person to hear of this matter in my country, so I was in a good position to be the next of kin (partner) of your president.
However, I am not aware that you are aware of this transaction.
I am a senior civil servant, I have been in government for a decade. As such, I have a strong desire to be able to help your country in this business and I want to share this with you.
I am the son of a former president who was assassinated by a foreign government. I was working for the Bank of Zimbabwe before he was assassinated by a foreign government.
The Bank of Zimbabwe has also been involved in the construction of the Gori Kewi Apartment Complex in the capital, ZANUMA, and also in the construction of the Gori Kewi Kewi Bank in the capital, ZANUMA. I am writing to you to provide you with a clear and reliable account of this matter, to enable you to transfer this money into your account, and also to let you know that I am not the only one who is involved.
I have also been informed of the murder of my former boss,
Mr Mr William W. Alvarez. He was the main contractor for the construction of the Mobutu Bank in that capital.
Since I was Mr Mr President, I was also still the head of the Bank of Zimbabwe. I have been put under a strict and strict security order to be kept safe. The security order was that I was to give up all the contracts for this project, but I think it is necessary to share this information with you.
This information was passed on to me by my former boss who was assassinated by the foreign government.
The execution of this contract was carried out without any other outside contractor.
The execution of all the other contracts is carried out by me alone.
I was the late Mr Mr W. Alvarez. He was the main contractor for the construction of the Mobutu Bank in that capital.
Since he was not the person who executed the contract, I did not have the option of betraying the secret to you.
I have also been informed of the death of my boss, Mr Mr William W. Alvarez. He was the main contractor for the construction of the Mobutu Bank in that capital.
Since I was his boss, I had asked him to come to Zimbabwe to help in the construction of both the Bank of Zimbabwe and the Bank of Zimbabwe Youth Bank.
I have also been informed of the death of my boss, Mr Mr William W. Alvarez. He was the main contractor for the construction of the Mobutu Bank in that capital.
Since I was his boss, I have agreed to provide you with a full account of all of this information so that you can transfer this money into your account, and also to let you know that I am not the only one who is involved.
