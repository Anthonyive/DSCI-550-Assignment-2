I'm a 24 year old woman in central London who has had a nightmare of being a bank director. The bank had told me that I should be a director of a foreign company with a foreign bank account. I have been looking for a bank finance officer to assist me in this business.

I contacted the bank in London to tell them the truth about my company and its existence. The bank, which is owned by my co-op partner, is still notifying me of this. When I contacted them to give me the necessary information, they told me they would not give me their money for a reason. I immediately called my co-op partner to tell him that I am not with them. He was very strict and very unhelpful to me.

I was very concerned and confused. I immediately called my co-op partner to tell him that I am not with them. He was very strict and very unhelpful to me.

He was very strict and very unhelpful to me.

I also contacted the bank in London that I am the only one who can help you.

I have also got your bank account details and a telephone number you can reach me via the contact form.

I want you to contact me immediately and we can discuss the matter further.

I want you to be my partner in this venture.
