Libya's government has paid the fee of $13.25 million to the British government, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.
A senior officer in the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Energy and Mines said they had been awarded the contract by the British bank which had been awarded the contract as the payment for the bank's share of the total contract cost for the next contract period.
The payment for this contract has been paid to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Energy and Mines.
The contract was awarded in September this year and will be paid to the British government to conclude the payment.
The Ministry of Finance has a fixed percentage of the money awarded to the British government as a part of its share, but the West Africa Banker's Association claimed to have been awarded the contract through the West African Banker's Association for the benefit of the Bank.
Since the deal was awarded by the bank he is now the Banker.
The official said that the money will be paid to the Bank of the West Africa and the Bank of the Republic of Congo for administration of the bank and for real estate management of the bank.
The bank may not want it to be opened, but the money will go to the Bank of Africa. It is still in its late stages of development and no one has been paid for the work.
However, the money was discovered in a foreign bank and hence it is still in active use.
All security and security procedures have been followed according to the code of conduct established by the Bank of the West Africa for the handling of real estate projects abroad.
The Bank of the West Africa has agreed to pay the money to the British government for the administration of the bank and for real estate management of the bank.
