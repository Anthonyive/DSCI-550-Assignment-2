Ten years ago, we had a plan to make a fresh start to the life of a professional business partner or account holder.

You will be given the opportunity of contacting your bank to invest your money, but you will be told by your bank that you have to go and seek a bank account in your country for the money.

We are now preparing a plan to invest the money and that is why we are still going through the process of making a decision to invest.

In order to get your money, you will need to apply for your bank account to invest the money in your country.

We are still in the process of applying for your bank account and we are awaiting your response to this letter.

I hope that you will not disappoint us in this business.

Best regards,

WILLIAM FALON, PRIVATE Partner
