The Dungeon of the Maori

A year ago, I met a man who worked for a merchant in a foreign bank.
He said that he had been working for a merchant for the past eight years.
He used a number of accounts in his foreign bank to make payments to customers in his country.
I followed the account closely and discovered that the merchant killed his wife and son before he was able to pay for the money in their accounts.
My investigation discovered that he had also been the beneficiary of a huge sum of money in his foreign bank account.
He was so poor that he was willing to give up his life for the cause of his country. He kept his money in foreign accounts and was willing to give up his life for the cause of his country.
I have decided to work with him to see if he can come to a conclusion to transfer the money to this account.
I am willing to work with you to ensure that the money is paid to Almighty God.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Yours truly,
Abigail Geble
