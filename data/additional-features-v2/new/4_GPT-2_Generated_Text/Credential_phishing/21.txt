The Association of American Architects (AAMI) is proposing that the Federal Government's funds be used for the construction of a new $3.5 billion, four-story, $300 million, five-story, $500 million building on a former railroad site in the South-West End of London, to be funded by the Government of the United States of America.
The proposal is based on the assumption that the Federal Government will not pay any interest to the property if the project is not done.
The proposal is being done by legal counsel for the Government of the United States of America.
The proposal is to operate a four-member Commission to assess the impact the project will have on the people of the United States of America, and to seek a course of action that will enable it to be successfully completed.
This proposal is being made in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal Government.
The proposal is to provide for the provision of a motor service contract to the Government of the United States of America.
The proposal is being drafted with the assistance of the Federal Government, and is being discussed with my colleagues at AAMI.
This proposal is being discussed with my colleagues at AAMI.
The proposal is to provide for the operation of a partnership to be set up to deal with the funds which might be required to enable the Government of the United States of America to operate the project in the South-West End of London.
