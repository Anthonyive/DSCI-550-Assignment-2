Dear Sir,
I am Dr. Joseph S. with the Free University of South Africa and I am writing you for my own personal benefit, as a foreigner I am visiting South Africa to join my colleagues in the French department of the French foreign ministry, to which we are now residing together.
I am interested in the possibility of assisting you in your future studies and to enable me to get a position as a foreign exchange rep in France.
I am here to give you the confidence I have that I can assist you in your personal development, as a foreigner, as a foreigner a foreigner, as a foreigner we are both here to work with.
I have the honour to be treated with utmost security and respect. I am Mr. David A. O. Smith.
I am the Assistant Director of the French Foreign Ministry ministries in France from 1995 to 1997, I am the co-chairman of the Technical Review Committee of France (TRCF), an international organisation to review foreign investment and foreign accounts in France.
The TRCF is a foreign investment and foreign account management service, first introduced in France by the former president, Jacques Chirac. The service has since been suspended due to a irregularities on the part of the French government.
The notice to the French Finance Ministry (FEMA), attached to the contract to deposit foreign funds with the French banks in a foreign bank in France, was executed by me as the co-chairman of the TRCF and that notice contains numerous other documents to contain the foreign account details, all necessary documentation and documents for application to the FEMA for transfer of the funds to the bank in France and for the approval of the bank to open a foreign account.
I have been very successful in my work with the TRCF, and as a result I will be the beneficiary of all the money deposited with the French bank for mutual good.
Due to the nature of my position, I am not allowed to present myself as the beneficiary of the fund and hence I cannot be present to receive the money. This means that I am not allowed to give any kind of information about the matter to my colleagues or even to myself.
However, since I am a foreigner, I am unable to give any information about the matter except to express my interest in the matter and as a result I am willing to assist you in your application for transfer of the funds to the French bank.
Please, please read this letter to enable you to understand more about this matter.
Best Regards,
Beth Davis.
