Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing you because you are my dear friend who was jailed in the US for years for the 9/11 attacks on New York City and London.
He was arrested by the US Marshals Service/Internal Security Division on 9/11/2000.
He was in custody for a long time before he was released by the US Marshals Service/Internal Security Division.
He was initially arrested in the United Arab Emirates on 9/11/2000.
He was charged with a very serious crime - treason.
However, the Federal Government of the United Arab Emirates said he should be allowed to leave the country for good.

I am writing because you were my friend who was arrested for 9/11/2000.
He was jailed for a long time before he was released by the US Government of the United Arab Emirates.
And I can assure you this was not a good decision for my country, for I have a wife and a child that was sent here from the US before I was released.
So, I want you to be the one to give us your full share of the money you will be entitled to in the United Arab Emirates, for if we get this money our country will be in a very bad state and we will be forced to ask for more money.
I will give you as much as you want to this money and you will receive it in the form of your personal account, my account will be the next of kin.
I will also charge you for the use of this money, so that we don't need any further money from you.
Best regards,
MATT HOPKINS
