The amount of money in my account was a surprise to me and my wife.
I am very grateful that you are willing to assist me in some way.
I am also going to send out some kind of letter to the rest of you, where I plead guilty for any and all of these sins.
Please keep the money as close as you can to your account.
Thank you,
Mrs. Carrie.
