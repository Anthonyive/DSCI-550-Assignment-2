My friend and I met in 2006 as a former partner of a large international banking company in the United Kingdom.
It was a very successful venture, but with a risk involved. The risk involved was huge.
The company was based in London, and operated by my partner and I.
I had the pleasure of visiting some of the late bankers and bankers who died in the banking sector in the late 1990's, and an article I wrote about them was published.
I was warned that this company could be used as a safe haven for money laundering, and I was encouraged by my partner and I to seek a safe haven in London.
I am writing this letter to you because as a former partner of the late banker and bankers who died in the banking sector in the late 1990's, I had great faith in you.
I have lived in London since the late late late 1990's, and I have great confidence in you. I am afraid that your confidence in me will be lost to the world because of this article.
I am writing to express my confidence that you will not disappoint me, because I am trying to contact you to explain the reason behind this article.
I want to assure you that I am not a big money man, and that this company
will not allow money to move through the network of banks in London without my assent.
I have a confidential telephone number for you to contact me if you would be willing to assist me in this matter.
Sincerely,
Mr. Robert B. Smith,
The Chairman,
United Bank of London
Dear Sir,
I have my client under contract to the Bank of England (BSE) to invest in a company that will invest in foreign companies for the Bank.
It is with great surprise that I discovered this business in my native country. The Nigerian president had come to London to seek political asylum in the United Kingdom for his wife.
I had been told by the Nigerian president that his wife was leaving the country for retirement as a result of his wife's death.
However, I had no choice but to sell the deal to the Nigerian government, which is known to be averse to foreign investments.
