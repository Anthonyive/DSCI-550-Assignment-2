The Malmo Express

$35 million

The first of three problems with this transaction is that the credit is not paid to us
as we cannot be compensated for the transaction because of security
issues.

However, we will be able to pay the bank with your help
and with a transfer account that will enable us to claim
the money from your account.

We are going to make a deal in the bank and you will have the
charge of the above account in your account and the money
will be sent to you by your partner
for safe keeping. We have no further to report on
this transaction.

Please contact me immediately if you are interested
and I can help you get this deal done as soon as
you reach me.

Kindly provide me any information you may need to
assist you in finding an honest partner to be
assured of the funds.

Dear Sir/Madam

I am Straisi Ato, the son of a woman you will never meet
in your life, if you will not respond.
I have lost all contact with you since my
children came to you.
I have lost both of my parents to cancer.
I have been seeking for a good father to take
my life over and am now in my late 60s.
I am married to a wealthy and successful man,
who is now in favour of his country.
I never meant to be a father to you, but I want you to
know that I am the man that will be the beneficiary
of this money.
Due to my illness I cannot come to your country
and I cannot live over there.
I have decided that I am going to invest this money
with you for the advancement of my country.
I have not not been able to find enough partners for this
money because of the lack of a good person
to finance this fund.
However, I shall be able to pay you to the
highest bidder, and you will be the beneficiary.
I have the confidence of God and the people of my
country in
being the one who is the beneficiary of this money.
The money is worth ten million
United States Dollars.
Please pay me immediately if you are interested.
Kindly provide me any information you may need to
assist you in finding an honest partner to be
assured of the funds.
