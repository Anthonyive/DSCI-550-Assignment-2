The Fund for International Development, one of the world's largest private banks, is the subject of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into possible corruption in its foreign branch.

The investigation will seek to determine the origin of the funds from a foreign bank in the US that is not mentioned in its security deposit, and if so, to locate the money in a safe deposit box, and to provide safe deposit documentation to the federal government for mailing back to you as a security deposit box for your use.

The fund will be held by the fund's holders, but will be paid in US dollar bills.

Please let me know of any further information that may be necessary for this investigation to conclude.

Thank you for your response.
