As a 21 year old college student in the capital of Konya, I was informed by my local representative that my contract is over, that I have to leave my country and shall be 'asleep in a bed' for over 10 days.

I contacted my lawyer, and he immediately got me into the custody of his local bank and my money has been transferred to this bank.

The bank cannot pay my bills because the money is kept in the bank in my name.

This is a serious matter because my name is not on the contract for the contract payment that we are going to
pay to you.

My lawyer has informed me that his client will be going to the next of kin to claim the money for his share.

The bank can not pay because I am a foreigner and I am the beneficiary.

However, I am still a university major and I am going to use my year of university for my career
investment. This is not possible because the contract is to be executed by
my lawyer who is not up to date on the contract payment.

So I was told by my lawyer that he had to wait in the security of
the bank until the next of kin to claim this money will be notified to me
if I am the beneficiary of the money.

I am therefore in the custody of his lawyer, and the bank cannot pay my bills because
the money is kept in the bank in my name.

It is my pleasure to inform you that I am the beneficiary of this contract.
You can be of assistance to me if you can provide me with a good
telephone number for your contact.

I hope you will be up to date on all the details of this deal.
Thank you for your assistance.

Dear Sir/Madam

I am going to present you a letter that I got from the person I met in the hospital with the
hospitalization and recovery of my partner, a man who I met in the hospital
after the fall of the Red Fort camp.
The letter was sent to a friend of mine who was
visiting from South Africa, and I am going to send a few people
who I believe should need your help, since you may
be a foreigner and I am going to be the beneficiary of the contract
payment
which will be executed by my lawyer.

I want you to be as honest and understanding as possible while
counseling others, since this letter does not contain
any information of any kind, so that you may
be able to assist me in this deal.

Thanks for your secrecy.
