The Scottish National Party (SNP) has been awarded the National Trust Fund for the construction of a new airport in the Canadian city of Gatineau.

The audit of the contract was conducted by the finance department of the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the The Canadian Tax Office (CTO) and the International Transfer Authorities.

The audit found that the contractor laid claim of the project to the CTO in Federal Bank of Canada (FBC).

The contract was awarded in December of 2006 through a joint venture between the contractor and Bank of Montreal.

The deal has since been awarded, but the audit found that the contractor paid the amount of $15M.

The responsibility for the payment of this sum rests with the department responsible for the approved payment of the contract. The contract has been awarded to the contractor based on the law and order conditions.

This deal is highly valued and a rare opportunity for an honest foreign contractor to get the contract awarded in Canada.

The responsible contractor, who is not an American citizen, has been contacted by the Finance Department to enable them to claim this sum for use in a foreign bank account as the beneficiary of the contract.

The contract is still valid until the date of award of this sum.

We want to thank you for your interest in this transaction.
