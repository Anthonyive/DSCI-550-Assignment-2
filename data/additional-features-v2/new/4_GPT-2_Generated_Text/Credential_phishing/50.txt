I am Michael L. Rocha, a senior civil servant from the United States Treasury Department.
I am a former military contractor who lost his life in a US military air strike
air strike in the Yemeni capital Sanaa.
I was sent to the United States by a foreign foreign company to assist in
approach a deal with the government. The contract was for the
contractor's name to be used to apply for a US government contract
for the installation of a South African national stadium in
the capital.
The contract was completed by September 2003.
It is highly recommended that you seek a foreign partner to
apply for the contract.
What I have been able to locate is a US National
Station in the South African capital of
Azerbaijan, which was awarded to a partner in
contract for the construction of a South African national stadium
in the capital.
The next day I was told by a colleague that my
post was over because I had made a late
payment to the foreign contractor for the South African
project.
I am going to seek your assistance to assist me in
approach the contract.
You can assist me either in money or in your
kind, and I am willing to assist you in
getting the project started.
I am not your type.
I am a foreigner who has been an officer during
the civil service of the United States Government.
I am an African American.
I have been assigned to assist in the construction of a
South African national stadium in
the capital city of Arak. The project is part
of the South African National Petroleum Project
Pavloxi, a South African oil terminal project which has been
passed on in favour of the government of South Africa to full
power of government.
From this day forward, I have kept a close watch on your
hand and this was my only opportunity to assist you in
approach the deal.
I am not your type.
The South African Government does not want to give up its
contracts to foreign companies, but they want to
pay for the necessary expenses that you
may not be able to accommodate.
If you are willing to assist me, I am sure you will
support and further develop the project.
Request for your cooperation:
