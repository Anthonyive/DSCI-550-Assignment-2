INTRODUCTION

I am a transgender man who is a member of the Christian Sons of Jehovah's Witnesses, an organization that is recognized by the United States Government as a bona fide organization for the service of the Jehovah's Witnesses.

My life begins with a poor decision I made in my late teens years of membership.

I have a son who was a member of the Christian Sons of Jehovah's Witnesses, also known as the Mormons, who was murdered by his former co-workers in the United States House of Representatives.

I am writing to inform you that I am married to a man who was a member of the Christian Sons of Jehovah's Witnesses, also known as the Mormons, who was murdered by his former co-workers in the United States House of Representatives.

This man died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place in the United States House of Representatives.

I am seeking your assistance in locating this man, who I believe may be the original victim of the murder and his co-workers who died in the motor vehicle accident.

I have decided to act as your hand in this transaction, by locating this man in the United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate and Independent Committee of Experts, which is the official body that handles the investigation of all bank accounts opened in the United States and foreign accounts held by foreign citizens.

I want you to help me in locating this man, and guarantee that I will be the person to invest this money in as your beneficiary.

I want you to provide me with your personal address, telephone, fax, and email so I can contact you by telephone or fax to the address I have provided you for the fund transfer.

I want you to enable me to transfer the funds to you as your beneficiary, without all of your being involved.

You can contact me by telephone or fax to the address I have provided you for the fund transfer.
