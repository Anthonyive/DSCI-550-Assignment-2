The head of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said on Friday that the Federal Government has notified the company in question of the release of confidential documents in relation to the investigation of the sale of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which was concluded in June this year.

One of the top officials in the Department of Inquiry (DIR), where the documents were discovered to have been held, is set to be appointed as a possible successor to the late Boeing co-pilot, who died in the crash.

According to a fax sent to me by the DIR/Director of Investigation (DIR) late on Friday, the documents will be released to the families of the deceased to enable them to proceed with the investigation.

However, the whole matter is still under investigation.

I have to inform you that in the course of the investigation, the company's management decided to ensure that the documents will be released to the families without any delay, i.e. without any delay in the execution of the plan.

As a result, in the course of the investigation, we discovered confidential documents belonging to the company which were used to make the sale of the plane.

The first of these was a confidential document relating to the sale of the MH370 plane, which was transferred to the FIA in the course of the investigation.

The second document, which was a certificate issued by the company to the original beneficiary of the plane, was a form of payment from the original beneficiary of the plane that was used to make the transfer of the plane to the bank account of the company.

I have to inform you that in the course of the investigation, we discovered confidential documents belonging to the company which were used to make the transaction to transfer the plane to the bank account of the company, to which the original beneficiary of the plane is entitled.

The third document, which we discovered in the course of the investigation was a letter, which stated that all the necessary documentation for the transfer of the plane was included in the notes, which were held by the company.

I have to inform you that the company has now decided to release the documents to the families for consideration of their security reasons, with no delay, as a result of the urgency of the business.

I have also recommend to you that your company will provide you with a certified certified copy of the documents and finally provide you with your share of the proceeds of the sale of the plane.

I want to assure you that this is a time of great peace.
