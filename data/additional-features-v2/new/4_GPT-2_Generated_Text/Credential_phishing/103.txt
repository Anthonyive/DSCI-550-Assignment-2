I am a member of the Black Community Council of Kenya (BCC), which was founded in 2006. This is a trade association for Nigerian citizens with an interest in the Nigerian economy. I am interested to know if you will be a member of this trade association. I am the president of the committee, which is charged with drafting the contract for the National Energy Administration (NEA) to operate the National Energy Processing Station (NEP). I will be your representative as the foreign customer for the contract. The contract is for the transfer of the oil and other minerals to foreign banks in Nigeria.
Have you ever heard of the NEP? The Union of Petroleum Exporting Countries (U.N.P.) was established to provide for the export of oil and other minerals to foreign banks.
The U.N.P. was established in 1966. Since then, some of the world's most important oil and mineral producers, including Nigeria, have been murdered in the name of corporate harrassment, foreign bank accounts, or other economic mismanagement.
The U.N.P. is an international bank where foreign customers can transfer their money to foreign banks.
Foreign customers can also transfer funds to accounts in Nigeria such as offshore accounts, in the country of their choice.
However, foreign customers may want to invest in the United States. 
The NEP has been a success so far.
Since the death of Nigerian prime minister Goodluck Jonathan in 1999, the U.N.P. has been a very successful bank.
Recently, I met with the president and prime minister of Nigeria to discuss the successful contract to transfer the oil and other minerals to foreign banks. The following letter was sent to the president and prime minister of Nigeria by a foreigner in the name of a foreign customer.
I share your interest in the agreement that was agreed to between myself and you in the transfer of the oil and other minerals to foreign banks and foreign account.
