Before I proceed, may I humbly introduce my self to your good self, My
Name is Mrs. Hajia lilian, an Iraqi refugee ,my husband was until
recently, one of the personal aid to the president of Iraq who was
formerly overthrown out of power by American Government .
Prior to this last serious crisis that is still ravaging in my
country,which
recently led to misfortune of our government and my late husband
position as the personal aid to the president, we were able to inherited the sum of US11 million.The funds were originally gotten from my late husband proceeds.
My late husband was able to safe guard the fund with a very good diplomatic &amp; Lifting Company Sudan Northen Africa
I have decided to contact you because I am interested in investing in
your country which is investment friendly. Please kindly guide and
assist me in making the right investment since I am also interested in
buying a residential property as I will be moving my family over there
as soon as every thing regarding technical and logictics details is
worked out and ascertained to our respective satisfaction. In view of
your participation,I am ready to give you a good negotiable percentage
for your assistance,or better still commit it into viable Joint venture
projects,be assured that you stand no risk of any kind as the funds
belong to me and my only survived son. As soon as I get your consent,
we will quickly move this fund to your country for investment .
However, upon your acceptance to work as my partner,
I am here with my only surviving son Mohammed, I strongly believe that
associating with you to embark on this and other business ventures will
derive a huge success here after, please include you private contact
telephone number and private e-mail when replying.
