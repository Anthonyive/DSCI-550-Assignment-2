<body><p>Dear friend,

Greetings to you in the name of our heavenly God.
This mail might come to you as a surprise and the
temptation to ignore it as unserious could come into
your mind; but please, consider it a divine wish and
accept it with a deep sense of humility. My name is
JAMES HOWARD. I`m a 55 years old man. I am British
living in Dubai (United Arab Emirate). I was a
merchant and owned two businesses in Dubai. I was
also married with two children. My wife and two
children died in a car accident six years ago.
Before this happened my business and concern for
making money was all I lived for. I never really
cared about other values in life. But since the loss
of my family, I have found a new desire to assist
helpless families. I have been helping orphans in
orphanage/ motherless homes. I have donated some
money to orphans in Sudan, South Africa, Cameroon,
Brazil, Spain, Austria, Germany and some Asian
countries. ! Before I became ill, I kept $15 Million
in a long-term deposit account in a finance
company . Presently, I?m in a
hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for
oesophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to
talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a
few months to live. It is my last wish to see this
money distributed to charity organizations. Because
relatives and friends have plundered so much of my
wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the
agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any
of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to
help me collect the deposit and the interest accrued
from the company and distributes it
amongst charity organizations. Use your judgement to
distribute the money and feel free to reimburse yourself
when you have the money for any cost you
incur during the process of collecting and
distributing the money to charity organizations. .
I?m willing to offer you a ! reward If you are willing
to help; please reply as soon as you can. May the
good Lord bless you and your family.

Regards,

James Howard
