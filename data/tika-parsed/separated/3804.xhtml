Greetings from Dubai, 



 



 



This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am Mr. Mr.Adnan Harmoudi Ismail, currently Head of Cooperate affairs with a reputable bank here in U. A. E. 



 



 



I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. I got your contact over the internet as a trustworthy and reliable person. Please pay attention and understand my reason of contacting you today through this email. I am the personal solicitor to a foreigner, Late Mr. Donald Heck, an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Egypt Air Flight 990, 1999 air crash {for more information about this crash and person you can contact this website}

He is an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, Mr. Donald Heck, made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. You may read more about the crash on visiting this B.B.C News internet website. If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money. 



 



 



I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for assistance. As the Account Officer to Late Mr. Donald Heck , coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Group , I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes. If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and May God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to you when the deposit was made for your perusal. 



 



 



I wait your urgent response via my private email: ahram07@hotmail.com



 



Regards, 

Mr.Adnan Harmoudi Ismail
