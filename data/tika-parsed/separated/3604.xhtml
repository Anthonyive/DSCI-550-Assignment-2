BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A).
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO WEST AFRICA.
PHONE CONTACT 00226.78.89.77.34.

DEAR FRIEND,

I AM THE MANAGER OF BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT  BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)IN 
MY DEPARTMENT I DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM FF ($31.500.000 U.S) THIRTY ONE 
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSANDS US DOLLARS). IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGS TO 
ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMER WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY ON 25TH 
JULY, 2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [FLIGHT AF4590] WITH THE WHOLE PASSENGER�S 
ABOARD.

ON 25TH JULY, 2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [FLIGHT AF4590] WITH THE WHOLE 
PASSENGER�S ABOARD. THE NAME OF THE DECEASED MAN WAS

(MR.ANDREAS SCHRANNER FROM MUNICH GERMANY)
N.B. IN OTHER FOR YOU TO BELIEVE ME HONESTLY, VISIT THE WEB SITE TO ENABLE 
YOU KNOW WHETHER WE CAN WORK TOGETHER, BELOW IS THE WEBSITE.

      http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS NEXT OF 
KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CAN NOT RELEASE IT UNLESS 
SOMEBODY APPLIES FOR IT AS NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS 
INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE IEARNT THAT ALL HIS 
SUPPOSED NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION DIED ALONGSIDE WITH HIM AT THE PLANE CRASH 
IEAVING NOBODY BEHIND FOR THE CLAIM.

IT IS THEREFORE UPON THIS DISCOVERY THAT I NOW DECIDED TO MAKE THIS 
BUSINNESS PROPOSAL TO YOU AND RELEASE THE MONEY TO YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR 
RELATION TO THE DECEASED FOR SAFETY AND SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT SINCE NOBODY 
IS COMING FOR IT AND I DON�T WANT THIS MONEY TO GO INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS 
UNCLAIMED BILL.

THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINE HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH MONEY REMAINED 
UNCLAMED AFTER FIVE YEARS, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO THE BANK 
TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED FUND.THE REQUEST OF FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS 
BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMER WAS A FOREIGNER AND A 
BURKINABE CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO A FOREIGNER.

I AGREE THAT 30 % OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS FOREIGN PARTNER, IN 
RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF A FOREIGN ACCOUNT, 10 % WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR 
EXPENSES INCURED DURING THE BUSINESS AND 60 % WOULD BE FOR ME AND MY 
COLLEAGUES.

THEN AFTER I AND MY COLLEAGUES WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR DISBURSEMENT 
ACCODING TO THE PERCENTAGES INDICATED.

THEREFORE TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRNANSFER OF THIS FUND TO YOU AS ARRANGED, 
YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS RELATIONS OR NEXT OF KIN OF THE DECEASED 
INDICATING YOUR BANK NAME, YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER, YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE 
AND FAX NUMBER FOR EASY AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND LOCATION WHERE IN 
THE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED . UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY, I WILL SEND TO YOU 
BY FAX OR EMAIL THE TEXT OF THE APPLICATION.

I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS HITCH FREE 
AND THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY ATOM OF FEAR AS ALL REQUIRED 
ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THE TRANSFER . YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME 
IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS LETTER.
TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU IMMEDIATELY.
thanks
MR MARK AKIMA
