Dearest In Christ,

I am Mrs Elizabeth Williams,from Kuwait.I am married to late Mr Jerry Williams,
who worked with Kuwait Embassy in Ivory Coast for Twenty-Six years before
he died in the year 2001,after a brief illness that lasted for only five
days.  We were married for Eighteen years with a duaghter(Lilian)who later
died in a motor accident.

Before the untimely death of my husband,we were both born again Christians.
Since after his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my
matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive
he deposited the sum of (US$5.8 M)(Five Million,Eight hundred Thousand United
States Dollar) in a General Trust Account with a prime bank in Abidjan Cote
d'Ivoire. Presently,this money is still with the bank.

Recently,Following my ill health, my Doctor told me that I may not last for
the next eight months due to my cancer problem.The one that disturbs me most
is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I decided to donate this
fund to a Christain organization (Church) that will utilize this money the
way I am going to instruct herein,according to the desire of my late husband
before his death.

I want this fund to be used in Christain Activities like,Orphanages, Christain
schools, and Churches for propagating the word of God and to endeavor that
the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that "Blessed
is the hand that giveth". I took this decision because I don't have any child
that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians
and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't
want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is
why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where
I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus
14 VS 14 says that "the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace".
I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health
hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't want
them to know about this development.With God all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank
in Abidjan. I will also issue you the documents that will prove you the present
beneficiary of this fund.
I want you and the Church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants
to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful
all through your life. Contact me on this e-mail address:(elizabeth_w1007@yahoo.com).
any delay in yourreply will give me room in sourcing another Church for this
same purpose.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping
to receive your reply.

Remain blessed in the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
