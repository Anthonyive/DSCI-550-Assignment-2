<body><p>&gt;From the Auditor 
Head of the Department,
First Commercial Bank
29 
Wilson Street,
London. EC2M 2SJ.

Dear Friend,
I am Titus James Morris 
auditor with First Commercial Bank,United Kingdom. And for reasons 
which will become obvious to you as you read on, I obtained your 
address particulars from an internet address listing. Please exercise 
some patience and read through my message. 

I have a very urgent and 
Confidential Business Proposition for you. On June 6th 1999, a Gold 
Consultant/Contractor with the British National Gold Corporation, Mr. 
Ahmed Yousef Mustafa, a National of Kuwait, made a numbered time 
(Fixed) Deposit for 12 calendar months, value £12,500,000.00 (Twelve 
Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in my branch. 

On 
maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but 
got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, his 
contract employers, the British national gold corporation wrote to 
inform us that Mr. Ahmed Yousef Mustafa died on an automobile accident; 
that he died without making a will, and all attempts to trace his next 
of kin through the Kuwait Embassy were fruitless. 

At first I was 
surprised that i did not receive much official cooperation in my 
inquiries in order to trace his kin in Kuwait, and inform them about 
Mr. Mustafa deposit of (GBP12.5m) plus accrued interest. I therefore 
made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Ahmed Yousef 
Mustafa had
actively opposed the government of his country Kuwait,and 
was consequently driven into exile. Being a mining expert, he 
subsequently obtained a job with the British national gold corporation, 
and settled in London. 

Thereafter, he walked into my office to make 
the aforementioned deposit of (GBP 12.5m).He did not declare any kin in 
his application paperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and wheni 
asked him he informed me that he wished it so. I accepted his 
application because banks are conservative and will always honour a 
customer'swishes, especially high networth customers. 

My proposal 
therefore is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the 
next of kin to Mr.Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood relation 
to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also necessary to 
come from the same country. I have workedout the modalities to achieve 
my aim of appointing a next of kin, and therefore, also by this means 
transfer this money total £12.5m abroad for us to share. 

Once you 
indicate your interest, I will initiate the processing of the transfer 
and in about 14 working days the money total £12.5m will be in your 
nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 
30% for you. 

Thanks and God bless,

Looking forward to your urgent 
reply.

Mr.Titus James Morris.
