<body><p>Complements,

I am Mrs. Patrika Kovac a Yugoslavian and company secretary to YUKOS OIL South Africa owned by Mikhail Khodorkovsky (M.K) one of the richest men in Russia and owner of the following companies: Chairman CEO: YUKOS OIL (Russian Most Largest Oil Company) Chairman CEO: Menatep SBP Bank (A well reputable financial institution with its branches all over the world).

I have in my procession documents to authenticate and authorise transfer of GBÂ£ 15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million British Pounds only) to be used in payment of oil contractors/suppliers   with our company based in South Africa in union with our boss now in detention.

Already the funds have been deposited with Absa Bank South Africa where the final transfer is expected as I was mandated to nominate beneficiaries for the funds. While I was on the process, My Boss got arrested for his involvement on politics in financing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor yavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian president. You can catch more of the story on this. &lt;http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2003/11/13/51215.html&gt;

 I solicit to nominate you as the beneficiary of the funds. I will provide documentations, which will enable Absa Bank South Africa to transfer the sum to your designated account as a contractor with the company. I am assuring you that this transaction is hundred percent risks free. All documentations to be provided will cover and prevent any retribution after transfer of funds, as interest of all parties will be strictly protected.

 The transaction has to be concluded before Mikhail Khod orkovsky is out on bail or prison though under medical treatment now and case adjourned indefinitely in the Russian courts. For your assistance, my colleagues and I are prepared to offer you 20% of funds (Subject to negotiations), 75% to us and 5% set aside for expenses parties might incur during and after the transaction.

Please contact me via Fax No: 27 11 507 6103 ONLY confirming your interest. Please also favour me with your full contact coordinates (Phone/fax etc) to enable me contact you at a convenient time. Should this be of no interest to you, please kindly confirm and treat as highly confidential at all times.



Much Regards,

Patrika Kovac. (Mrs)
