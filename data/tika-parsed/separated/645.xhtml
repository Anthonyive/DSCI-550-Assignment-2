<title>Compliment of the season</title>

<body><p>From: "MRS LOI C. ESTRADA http://www.iro.bsp.gov.ph/whoswhoprint.asp?ID=30 
Dear Sir 
My name is LOI C. ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located in the South East Asia. 
My husband was recently impeached from office by a backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the Senate. 
My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption, embezzlement, and the mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. The present government is forcing my husband out of manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter. 
During my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for now. 
before my husband was impeached, I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000 million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) out of Philippines and deposited the money with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold and my foreign business partner owned it. 
I am contacting you because I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in investment in your country. 
I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. 
When I receive your positive response I will let you know where the security company is and the payment pin code to claim the money which is very important. 
For now, all our communication is by e-mail because my line are right now connected to the Philippines Telecommunication Network services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. 
I will ask my son to contact you to give you more details , after i have received a responce from you. 
Thank you and God bless you and family. 
MRS LOI C. ESTRADA
