Dear friend
This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the
fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I
have no intentions of causing you any pains. As you
read this, I do not want you to feel sorry for me,
because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name
is Mark Daniels, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I
have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal
cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity
in caring for my health. It has defied all forms of
medicine and right now, I have only about a few months
to live according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone not even myself but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,
I was always hostile to people and only focus on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more
to life than just wanting to have or make all the
money in the world. I believe when God gives me a
second chance to come to this world I would live my
life a different way from how I have lived it. Now
that I know my time is near, I have willed and given
most of my properties and assets to my immediate and
extended family members and as well as a few close
friends.
I have decided to give alms to charity organizations,
as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do
on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some
charity organizations in the U.A.E, London and
Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly,
I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked
members of my family to close one of my accounts and
donate the money, which I have there to charity
organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the
money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them
anymore, as they seem not to be contented with what I
have left for them. The last of my money which is the
huge cash deposit that I have with security firm
Abroad .I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and
let them know that it is I Mark Daniels that is making
this generous donation. I am writing this from my
laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my
time to come. I pray that God uses you to support and
assist me with good heart.
Contact email:m_daniel@myway.com
God be with you,
Mark Daniels.
