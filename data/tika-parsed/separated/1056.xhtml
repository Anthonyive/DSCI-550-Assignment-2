DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY, PRETORIA,
SOUTH AFRICA.
Dear Sir/Madam,
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my
colleagues.Your information was given to me by a member of the
South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) Who was with
the Government delegation on a trip to your country for a bilateral
conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided
to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of
the deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you
will keep it confidential because of the nature of this
business. Within the Department of Minerals &amp; Energy where I
work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation and with
the co-operation of two other top government officials, we have in our
possession an overdue payment of funds in US Dollars .
The said funds represent certain percentage of the total
contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a
foreign contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced to the
amount of US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five Hundred
Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has
been paid to the original contractor,leaving the excess balance
unclaimed. Since the present elected Government is determined to pay
foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good
relationship with foreign governments and non- government
agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the
Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa
(RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary
of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate
foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary information
upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will
be secured on behalf of you/your company. I have the authority
of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to
assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be
Thirty percent (30%), while my colleagues and I receive seventy percent (70%).
The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether
you/your company does contract projects as a transfer of powers
will be secured in favour of you/your company. Also, your area
of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution
of this transaction. Based on trust I reposed my confidence in you and
hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me via
email bikozulato@netscape.net, for further details upon your acceptance of this
offer. It is important to note time is of essence in this transaction so please
do not fail to inform me whether or not you accept my proposal.
Thanks for your co-operation.
Regards,
biko zulato.
