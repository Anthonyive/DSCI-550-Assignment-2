<body><p>From:     Frank Michelle Esq.
          London, U.K.
          Telephone: +44 703 184 7859
          Fax line: +44 709 287 0887
          E-mail:barristertony@compaqnet.fr

I must apologise for berging into your mailbox without a formal introduction 
of myself to you. Actually, I got your mailbox in the web while trying to 
get a good and capable business person in your country for both business and 
investment purposes.Let me start by introducing myself; I am  Barrister 
Frank Michelle (Esq) I was the Personal Attorney to late Mr. Morris Thompson 
an American who was a private businessman in my country unfortunately lost 
his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on 
January 31st 2000, including his wife and only daughter.

You can read more about the crash on visiting these sites below,

1. http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list

2. http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html

Before the plane crash, Mr. Morris Thompson made a numbered fixed deposit 
for 18 calendar months with a value of US$ 2,500,000.00 (TWO MILLION, FIVE 
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS) in a bank here in U.K. Upon maturity 
several notice was sent to him, another notification was sent and still no 
response came from him. I later found out that Mr. Morris Thompson and his 
family had been killed in that plane crash. After further investigation it 
was also discovered that Mr. Morris Thompson's  next of kin was his daughter 
who died with him in the crash.

What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the 
expiration of 5 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the U.K. 
GOVERNMENT, if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my 
suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the 
next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson so that you will be able to receive these 
funds for both of us.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:-

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall 
come out successfully. As a barrister, I will prepare the necessary document 
that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson.

PLEASE YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE YOUR FULL INFORMATION SUCH AS STATED BELOW,

[1] NAME:

[2] ADDRESS:

[3] AGE:

[4] SEX:

[5] TELEPHONE:

[6] FAX:

[7] OCCUPATION STATUS:

Also be informed that this Transaction will take us just 15 working days to 
accomplish beginning from when I receive your Data's.After you have been 
made the next of kin, I will also file an application to the bank on your 
behalf as soon as I secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in 
your favor for the movement of the funds to an account that will be provided 
by you. This process is 100% risk free as I have set out all the modalities 
to see that a legalized method is used because then I will prepare all the 
necessary documents.

Please note that utmost secrecy and confidentiality is required at all times 
during this transaction. Once the funds have been transferred into your 
nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 50% for me, 45% for 
you and 5% set aside for any incidental expenses incurred during this 
transaction. If you are not interested, please delete this letter so that I 
can scout for another competent partner to conclude this transaction. Should 
you be interested please send me your full names, telephone, fax number and 
email address as stated above.  I will prefer that you reach me via this 
email address:- frankmichelle@compaqnet.fr

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards,

Frank Michelle Esq.
