<body><p>FROM: MR. PETER WANG QIN

STANDARD BANK SA

E-MAIL: pet_wang@standardbanksa.net
Dear Sir,


                                   HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL

Greetings.

This mail may come to you as a surprise but I plead with you to patiently
read through it before making a decision whether to assist me or not.

I wish to solicit for your assistance in the transaction which I strongly
believes will be of mutual benefit to both of us if treated with trust and
confidentiality that it deserve.

My name is Mr. Peter Wang Qin, the branch manager of a reputable bank
in Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, in the Republic of South Africa. I and
two of my colleagues wish to seek your assistance in the transfer of some
huge sum of money into a foreign bank account.

This money was deposited seven years ago in a fixed deposit account in my
bank by an Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Mining
Corporation. (Name deliberately withheld for now) The length of time for the
maturity of the fixed deposit was five years, which expired towards the
ending of last year. Upon maturity, a routine notification was sent to his
forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month, a reminder was also sent and finally we discovered from his
Contract Employers - The South African Mining Corporation that the Depositor
died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that
the depositor/beneficiary actually died in a car Accident here in South
Africa, in May 2000 and he left nobody as next-of-kin to claim this money.
All efforts made to trace any known relations of his proved abortive, and no
one has written our bank in this regard.

Hence, this said money is still lying in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. Now itï¿½s clear
no one will ever come forward to claim it. And according to the Laws of
Republic of South Africa, at the expiration of 5(five) Years, the money will
revert to the ownership of The South African Government if nobody applies to
claim the fund.

All modalities for the successful transfer of this money into an offshore
bank account have been put in place and we are looking for a trust worthy
foreign partner into whose bank account this fund would be remitted to and
it is this regard that my colleagues have mandated me to provide a partner
who will assist us. We have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total
amount if you should accept to assist us.



If you are interested in giving us the required assistance, kindly reply
this mail stating your Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because of
the secrecy surrounding this transaction, l suggests that you contact me
only through e-mail, until further notice.

I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you soon. Feel free to ask
any question in this regard.

I remain,

Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Peter Wang Qin
