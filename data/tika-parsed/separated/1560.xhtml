<body><p>Good Day,

I am writing this letter with confidence believing that if it is the wish of God for you to help me and
my younger brother, God almighty will bless and reward you aboundantly and you would never
regreat of helping us,i know that you will be surprise to recieve this mail,before i go on let me tell
you a little bit of myself,my name is Miss Mariam Sinko from republic of Liberia in west Africa,i and
my younger brother Johnson jr.Sinko were the only surviving children of our late father Mr.jonhson sinko.
My late father was a dealer of row Gold and Diamond, he was a very prosperous businessman,
infact they call him the richest man in the town of Lofa,but he was killed one early morning
on 20/4/2003 by the rebels,may his soul rest in peace,those rebels broke in and captured the
town of vangerma which is the main city in lofa county,killing and looting,it was there my family
has been executed,they killed my father and mother with my three younger once,i and my only
brother  johnson jr. the only son we have were saved because were at school when the whole
insindant was happning then we ran into forest,it was a long story,we have under go so many
diffcuties,but i thank God for our life,so when we get back to our house all our family has been
killed i dont know what to do cos the rebels have loots everything in our house,

luckly to us,i found my fathers suitcase with some documents showing that he deposited the
sum of five million five hundred thousand united state dollars in a financial/security company
in Abroad with my younger brother's name as his next of kin so we made away with these
documents.so what we need is a trusted and God fearing person who shall help us secure
this money into his account in which we shall meet him for him to invest the money for us and
we shall contuine our school,the person will take us as his own children, on hearing from you
we shall give you the contact of the holding firm for you to discuss on our behalf,awaits to hear
from you as you read this mail.you can also contact us at e-mail,msinko26@voila.fr ;
