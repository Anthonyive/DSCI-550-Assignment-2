<body><p>Dear Friend,
 
I know this mail may come as a surprise to you, since we 
do not know ourselves or have any previous contact before now, my 
purpose of writing you is this.
 
We believe that you would be in a 
position to help us in our bid to transfer the sum of twenty-seven 
million five hundred thousand dollars ($27.5m) into a foreign account.
 
We are members of a special committee for budget and planning of the 
ministry of petroleum, this committee is principally concerned with 
contract appraisals and approvals in order of priorities as regards 
capital project of the federal government. With our positions, we have 
successfully secured for ourselves the sum of twenty-seven million five 
hundred thousand united states dollars ($27.5m). 
The present 
government in my country are seeking the support of foreign 
governments, so they gave directive to all federal parastatals to 
compile and settle all foreign contractors being owned for contract 
that has been executed, so our plan is to include the name that you 
will provide us, as one of the contractors being owed in my 
corporation, the Nigerian national petroleum corporation (NNPC). 
What 
we need from you is (1) a company name or a name of which to use as the 
company that did execute the contract (2) an account even if empty into 
which the fund will be transferred, this is because our code of conduct 
prohibits government officials from operation or owning foreign 
account. 
It has been agreed that the owner of the account will be 
compensated with US$8.3million of the remitted funds; we will keep 
US$16.5million, while US$2.7million has been set aside to offset 
expenses and pay the necessary taxes. It may also interest you to know 
that two years ago similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. 
George Brooks of (BROGE INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORPORATION) at number 
135, East 57th street, 28th Floor, New York 10022 with telephone (212) 
308-7788 and telex number 6731689, after the agreement between both 
partners in which he was to take 25% of the remitted fund (fifteen 
million united state dollars $15.000.000.) was duly transferred into 
his account only to be disappointed on our arrival in New York as we 
were told that Mr. Brooks was no longer on that address, while his 
telephone number had been re-allocated to somebody else, that was how 
we lost our money to Mr. Brooks. 
This time around we need a more 
reliable and trusted person or a reputed company to transact this 
project with hence this proposal to you, so if you can prove yourself 
to be trustworthy ready to partake in this project then we are prepare 
to do business with you. 
What we need from you is the assurance that 
you will let us have our share after the transfer of the fund ($27.5
million) into your account. 
If this proposal satisfies you,we can 
advice you on modalities of the transaction, and note that all 
modalities has been worked out and once started will take less than two 
weeks with the absolute support of all concerned. 
Note that this 
transaction is 100% risk free and totally safe now or after the fund 
transfer to your account. I will also like you to forward to me your 
telephone number for easy communication. Please treat as urgent and 
confidential as I look forward to your reply. 

Best Regards, 

&gt;From 
Engr. moel Kobo Ali
