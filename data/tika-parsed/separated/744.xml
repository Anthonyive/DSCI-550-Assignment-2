b) Bank name, address, telephone and fax numbers and Details of the Account, which you are the only signatory that the money will be Transferred into. We do not mind if the account is a zero-based account or an account with no funds in it so long as it is functional for this purpose.
The above requirements are to legalize the claim for payment and transfer of the money to your account.
