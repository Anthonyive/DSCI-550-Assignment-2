MANAGER:
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB)
DAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch.
Email: zatajoseph@netscape.net


I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to
worry as i am using the only secured and confidential medium
available to seekfor foreign assistance in a business.
  I am MR JOSEPH ZULU-ZATA. from the AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB),
DAKAR-SENEGAL.Branch.   This business request may seem strange, but
I crave your indulgence and pray you view it seriously as I am
convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to
a money transfer.
  On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with 
Petroleum Corporation, Mr.Robert Rice  made a numbered  time (fixed)
deposit for twelve calendar months,
valued at US$10,500,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
)in  my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply.
  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from
his contract employers, the  Petroleum Corporation that  Mr.Robert
Rice and his wife Mrs. Mary Rice died in the plane crash On October
31, 1999, (an  Egyptair Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers
on board as you can  confirm it yourself via the website below: 

 http://www.greatdreams.com/PassEAir990.htm

 On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a
Will and attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I
therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr.Robert
Rice did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his
official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank.
This sum of US$10,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over
with the  principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever
come forward to claim it according to African law, at the expiration
of (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the
Senegal Government if nobody  applies to claim the fund.
  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner
to  stand as the next of kin to Mr. Robert Rice so that the fruit of
this  old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt
Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide
immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will
prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in
place as the next of  kin.We shall employ the service of an attorney
for the drafting and notarization of the Will and obtain the
necessary
documents and letter  of probate administration in your favour for
the transfer.
  Any bank account in any part of the world which you will provide
will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the
beneficiary/next of kin.The money will be paid into your account for
us to share in ratio of  70% for me and 30% for you.. There is no
risk at all; the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and
my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful
execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply
immediately via the private email address below, upon your
responses, I shall provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction.
   Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that
this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I
shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
  Please upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the
following  to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer
into your bank account:
   1.) The beneficiary's name.
   2.) Your private / official telephone and fax number.
   3) Your address.

Awaiting your Urgent Reply via my private
email:zatajoseph@netscape.net .

Thanks and God bless,
MR JOSEPH ZULU-ZATA.
MANAGER:
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.(ADB)
