<body><p>Dear Sir,

You may be surprised to receive my letter, however, I got your contact As a 
result of my desperate desire for assistance, and though this mail is 
Unsolicited I pray you be humane to consider it. I have decided to contact 
you for confidential, urgent and rewarding joint business.

My name is Dr.Paul Osadebe; I am from the Federal Republic of Nigeria and 
the chairman, Contract Award Committee of Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporation (NNPC). I have been on this position for the past ten years; but 
I have nothing to show for it. I will love it, if the both of us could do 
business together, which will be of mutual benefit.

Since I am the Chairman Contract Award Committee, I will award a Forty 
million US dollars ($40 million USD) contract in your favour to supply Gas 
Turbines and equipments. A Mobilization (up front) fee of twenty million U.S 
Dollars ($20 million USD) will be given to you to start the supply. But as 
soon as the mobilization fees gets to your hands, you are not going to do 
the supply. You and myself will share this mobilization fee on a 50-50 basis 
(Equally). The reason why I want us to share this start up fee is because I 
have been in this Position as the chairman for the past ten years, and I 
don稚 have a personal house of my own, my salary is a peanut. I cannot 
adequately take care of my children. In fact, things are very difficult for 
me. If I retire, I will have nothing to fall back on. People come sometimes 
to seek for favour from me and after awarding them contracts; they値l not 
remember me again.

A lot of people promised and failed me. As a result of this, I want to help 
my self this time because I値l not want to die a poor man. If we do this 
business Together, with your full co-operation and support, we will 
successfully complete it within five days. I am the person who will 
authorize the release the start up fee to you.

You have nothing to fear. I want you to remove anything like fear from your 
mind. This is the safest business you can ever think of. I will give you 
more information on how we are going to do this business as soon as I 
receive your reply showing that you are ready to do the business with me. 
But please do not discuss this business with anybody, even your best friends 
until we have finished successfully.

I will want you to reply me immediately so that I can tell you the next step 
to take. In your reply, please include your full names, address, and private 
telephone /
Mobile  and fax numbers.

Best Regards

Dr.Paul Osadebe
