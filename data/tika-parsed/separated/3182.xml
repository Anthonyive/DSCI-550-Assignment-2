CHINA MERCHANT BANK.
DES BOUEX RD. BRANCH,
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG. 


NOTIFICATION AS NEXT OF KIN/BENEFICIARY 

DATE: 18/10/2006

I am Mr.Joseph Yun, credit officer of the China Merchant Bank.I have a  concealed business suggestion for 
you.


Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Gen.Talfik Haddad who was  with the Iraqi forces and also business 
man made a numbered fixed  deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Three Million,Six  
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.


Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war. Again after the war another notification 
was sent and still  no response came from him. We later find out that the General and his  family had been 
killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered 
that the General did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the  paper work of his bank 
deposit.  
And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in 
my bank. So, Twenty Three Million,Six Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is 
still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. 


What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my  country at the expiration three years the funds 
will revert to the ownership  of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this 
backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as  a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to 
Gen.Talfik Haddad so that you  will be able to receive his funds. 
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we  shall come out successful. 
I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document  that will back you up as the next of 
kin to the late General,all that is  required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full  
Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of 
kin,the attorney will also file  in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and  letter of 
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that  will be provided by you. 

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a  legalized method and the attorney 
will prepare all the necessary  documents.  
Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning  this issue. Once the funds have 
been transferred to your nominated bank account we  shall share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you 
and 5%for any  expenses incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested please 
send me your private phone and fax  numbers for easy communication, you can write me via my private 
box thus:  (josef_yun499@yahoo.com.hk ) and i will provide you with more details of  this transaction.


Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.


Kind Regards, 
Mr. Josef Yun.
