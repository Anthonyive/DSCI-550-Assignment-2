<body><p>ASSYLUM CAMP ABIDJAN
FROM JOHN SIMON
Attn: President/CEO


                                       CONFIDENTIAL

Dear One,

I am JOHN SIMON the only son of late former Director of 
finance,Chief Vincent SIMON
Sierra-Leone diamond and mining corporation. I must 
confess my agitation is real, and my words is
my bond, in this proposal. My late father diverted this 
money meant for purchase of
ammunition, for my country, during the peak of disastrous 
civil war in my country, now he has
deposited the money with one of the BANK in Abidjan, where 
i am residing under political asylum with my mother Mrs 
MONEYKA SIMON and younger sister.


Now the war in my country is over with the help of ECOMOG 
soldiers, the present government of Sierra Leone has 
revoked the passport of all officers who served under the 
former regime and now ask countries to expel such person 
at the same time freeze their account and confiscate their 
asset, it is on this note that I am contacting you, all I 
needed from you is to furnish me with your bank 
particulars:

1) Account name
2) Account number 
3) Bank address, telephone and fax number For you to 
assist me transfer this money in your
private bank account, the said amount is (Twenty seven 
Million Dollars) $27 Million.

I am compensating you with 15 % of the total money amount, 
now all my hope is banked on you and I really wants to 
invest this money in your country, were their is stability 
of Government, political and economic welfare. Honestly I 
want you to believe that this transaction
is real and never a joke. My late father Chief SIMON

gave me the certificate of deposit issued to him by BANK 
on the date of deposit, for
you to be clarify because, I do not expose my self to 
anybody I see, I believe that you are able to keep this 
transaction secret for me because this money is the hope 
of my life, it is important. Please call me immediately 
after you must have gone through my message fill free and 
make it urgent. That is the reason why I offered you 15 % 
of the total money amount, and in case of any other 
necessary expenses you might incur during this 
transaction. N.B Try and negotiate for me some profitable 
blue chip investment opportunities which is risky free 
which I
can invest with this money when it is transferred to your 
account, personally I am interested in estate management 
and hotel business, please advise me.


Call me back immediately you receive this message for more 
explanation.And promisse me my younger sister and our 
mother to be a father considering our situation
and not to betray us.


NB: my late father used me the only son as the

beneficiary / next of kin on the day of deposit and also 
told me I need a foreign assistance of a
foreigner with a legitimate bank Account abroad who will 
stand as co-beneficiary and partner abroad.


Thanks and God bless

Best regards
JOHN SIMON
