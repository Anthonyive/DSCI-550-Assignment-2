<body><p>I NEED YOUR QUICK RESPONSE

Calvary Greetings

I am a preacher with the Seed Harvest Ministry,and I will like to get advice
from you.I believe the advice I need is secular to some extent, but do have
the patience to understand my intention.  

A few year's ago I was in Baghdad,Iraq where I had established a little
congregation where I preached regularly,but the war escaleted and the church
was converted to a hospital of soughts. Before then, On one faithfull day
three American Soldiers came to me and left a trunk box of Money with me and
swore to come back for it. 
 
When the war in Iraq intensified I was escorted to My country Benin Republic
West africa, by the U.S soliers who felt the content of the trunk box was
church documents and never cared to check the trunk box,, when I was getting 
fraustrated I returned to Iraq only to find out that two of the three Soldiers
died in Battle while the last was decleared MIA (Missing in Action). 
 
Now I have the fund which belongs to the soldiers and which is Eight million
us dollars ($8,000.000.00),but i have deposited it with a security company
here in my country Benin Rep, and I was contacted in a letter dated 10th of
May.2006 by the company asking me to indicate if I was in reciept of the
letter as a sign that I am still living and still subscribed for their
service.  

I am interested in using a small fraction of this money,much less than ten
percent for a re-organisation of the work, but I do not need the rest and do
not want to have any direct dealing with it, I need someone who will be able
to use the fund better maybe for charity or something universally profitable,
I have thought of doing it my self but, my ministry is the apocalypse and I
believe and preach the soon comming  which make me not indulgent in reliance
on money or wealth in any form. 
 
I also do not have the money that has accrued on the service and safe deposit
of the company that holds the trunk box, I will be glad if you have any
interest in the direction of maybe managing or transmitting the fund as you
prefer in your capacity like using it to help the motherless and people in the
3rd world countries. I will like you to give me 
your phone  number for easy and good communication.  I will be glad to get a
response from you through my 
direct email address pastor_jonesbell@mail.ru  

Regards.
Pastor Jones Bell
