<body><p>FROM:CHIEF.(DR.)BODE GEORGE
ADEMOLA ADETOKUNBO STREET
VICTORIA ISLAND
LAGOS-NIGERIA

Dear Sir,

RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

I am CHIEF(DR.)BODE GEORGE., Chairman to the Contract Review
Panel that was recently inaugurated by the President of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria to review the activities of past military government with
particular reference to contracts awarded by all ministries between 1990
to 1999. In the course of carrying out our assigned duties, we discovered
the sum of USD40.5 (forty million, five hundred thousand dollars) only lying
idle in a suspense account with our apex bank. This funds emanated from
grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate of foreign firms
by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation. On completion of our assignment, this amount was
deliberately not included in our report because we want to capitalize on
this once in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it.
The only option we have to achieve our aims and objective is to have this
fund transferred to a country of our choice where it can be kept in trust
and safe custody for us. We are however handicapped at the moment by
our status as civil servants, which barred us from operating foreign
accounts while still in government service.

Thus, through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce,
you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private
entrepreneurship. On this premise, we have no doubt in your ability to
handle a business of this nature, which informed our desire and wish to
enter into a partnership with you. This business involves the remittance of
this amount into your bank account with the hope of travelling down to
meet you physically in order to receive our share. We hope to invest some
in profitable ventures in your country based on your advise while the
balance will be repatriated home as foreign earnings. We have mapped
out strategies and all paperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success.

The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in
the world over, bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world
countries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for
execution. That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those that
executed one of such projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-
invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has
been paid. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free as there
is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future for we are well
connected in official circle. Given our level of commitment at the moment,
we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part, the objective
of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of
two weeks. It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the
transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum, 75% will be for
my colleagues and I.

If you are interested in this proposal, please call or send me an e-mail
VIA:bode_george@xuppa.com for more clarifications. If however
you are not interested, still let me know to enable me search for someone
else to carry out this business with.

I anticipate a timely response from you.

Thanks.

Yours Sincerely,

CHIEF(DR.)BODE GEORGE
