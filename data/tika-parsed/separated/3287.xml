SPECIAL DUTIES REFERENCE

**UNO/WBF LM-05-371**
**ORDERING CONTRACTOR:
DIPLOMATIC BOX 55KG

Dear Beneficiary,

I am Rev. Fr. Thomas Douglas, a senior staff with the World Bank fact finding &amp; special duties office. I and the Chief security officer (CSO) of this organization have arranged with an officer in the computer section to bring out part of your total pending payment with reference number (LM-05-371) amounting to US$5 million. (Five Million United State Dollars) Why we did this is because according to information gathered from the bankï¿½s security computer, you have been waiting for a long time to receive this payment without success. As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect of your pending payment. The said payment is been arranged in a security-proof box weighing 55kg. This box is been padded with synthetic nylon and to open it you will have to cut the pad before you will meet the button that you will press to open the dial code-lock. There is no way you can open the box and be able to close it again because it was padded with machine. 

Today a friend of mine who is a diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security courier service company that is specialized in sending diplomatic materials and information from one country to another, which also has diplomatic immunity, I have therefore met with the official of the security courier service and concluded shipping arrangement with them, which they will commence as soon as I have your go ahead order. The diplomat who will be bring in this consignment to you is an expert and has been in this line of work for many years now so you have nothing to worry about. After all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars (US$500,000.00) to any charity organization I designate as soon as you receive your money. To this effect, you will send to us a promissory note for the donation along with your address where you will like the box to be delivered to by the courier.

Please you have to maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this way to help you. You are advised not to inform anyone about this until you received your money. Am helping you on this because something in me is tells me that you are an honest person. When you conclude this and you send our promise, we will help to ship the final part of your money to you. May God be with you as i wait for your response Feel free to call me if you will like us to discuses more on this TEL: +221 4183317.

Yours Faithfully
Rev. Fr. Thomas Douglas
Director, Special Duties. UNO/WBF</p>
