<body><p>INVESTMENT ASSISTANCE.

I am Mr Chuks Anthony, the financial Controller and Contract Award Committee Chairman
in the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) in Lagos, Nigeria. My colleagues have
assigned me to seek for assistance of a reliable foreigner through whom we can transfer the
sum of US $65,500,000.00 (sixty Five Million, five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) which
arose from deliberate over- inflated contract value for the General expansion of the Kanji
Dam Thermal Station on behalf of National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) for increased
energy generation to Nigeria and some other West African Countries. The Contract was
awarded in 1998 during the late General Sanni Abacha regime to an expatriate firm with the
consideration of 10% commission agreement on the total contract value. The contract has
been completed and the contractor has long been paid, we are now left with this
US$65,500,000.00 representing the 10% our own share as agreed presently in the Federal
Government account. The favorable political/economic climate in this country now presented
an opportunity for this money to be transferred out of the country. I got your contact from a
commercial attached to your emabassy. This assurance gave me courage to link you up for
this particular transaction, and I hope it will be of mutual benefit to all of us. Our contact in
the Federal Ministry of Finance have given us a go a head advice to begin the process of the
remittance, hence we have set in motion the machinery for the take off of the transaction and
further action will commence immediately we hear from you. We have agreed that after the
transfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 30% of the total amount
transferred, 10% for incidental expenses from you and us, while the remaining 60% will be
for us. We decided to give you this percentage in order to motivate you and also to let you
feel satisfied at the end of this transaction. The nature of your business is not particularly
relevant for the success of this transaction. All we require is your willingness to co-operate
and assurance that our own share will be given to us when this money is transferred into your
account. All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a no risk situation on the sides
of both parties and it is believed that the conclusion of this transaction will not last more than
fourteen (14) working days. However, we are going to retrieve the whole documents that will
be related to this transaction so that both parties will be protected after the transfer of the
money into your account. Since we have no knowledge of business, our plan is to invest this
money into Real Estate, Stocks and we can also invest in some other profitable business in
your country based on your advice because many of our years has been spent as Civil
Servant, and we may likely resign from government service to private businesses after this
money is transferred into your Account. Please note that this business is strictly confidential
and must not be disclosed to a third party. This is necessary to avoid disclosure that may
jeopardize the transaction. Finally, if this proposal is acceptable to you or if you have any
questions, feel free to contact me on the above E-mail address. You should also send to me
your private telephone / fax numbers and E-mail address for easy and confidential
communication. I will oblige you with further information if so required. Please reply this
