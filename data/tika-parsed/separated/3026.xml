<title>DEAR BELOVED,</title>

<body><p>DEAR BELOVED, 

I am Sussan Adams 

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above 
named person. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but Iâ€™m now 
in Nigerian General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who 
worked with U.S embassy in LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in 
the year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He 
died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his 
death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not 
to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible 
is against. 

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million 
(Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, 
this money is still under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE 
COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 
SEVEN months due to my cancer 
problems. 

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I 
decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or 
muslim individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to 
instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund on, 
orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows propagating the word of God 
and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to 
understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision 
because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my 
husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard 
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation 
where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason 
for taking this bold decision. 

I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I 
am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the 
lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any 
telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of 
the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want 
them to know about this development. With God all things are possible. 
As soon as I receive your reply I forward your personal information, 
such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your telephone and fax 
number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal owner of 
my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your 
nominated Bank Account in your country. 

I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as 
the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want 
you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my 
shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund 
when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a 
life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must 
serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through 
your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching for a 
church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me 
that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from 
you as soon as possible. 

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. 

Yours in Christ, 

Mrs. Sussan Adams
