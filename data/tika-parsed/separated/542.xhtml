<body><p>THE CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT
AWARDING COMMITTEE
ECOWAS HEADQUATERS
ACCRA GHANA
WEST AFRICA.

I am Mr.Kazeem Ahmed,the Chairman of ECOWAS contract awarding committee in
ecowas sub-regional head quarter in Accra Ghana, West Africa. In due respect
and
regard, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be
very beneficial to both of us
at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in my
department,we discovered a huge sum of money that was over invoiced
amounting $35,000,000.00 and un-recorded for in the books of Accounts.We
discovered that it has been floating since 1997 through 2001 in
international
Bank of Africa Accra Ghana. this is found out to be over influence on
contract
payments and over invoice. Personally the information is kept secret by me
and
my partner to enable the whole plan and ideas profitable and successful
during
the time of execution. As it may interest you to know, I got your contact
through business inquires from the  chamber of commerce here in my country
as I
was making contact for an honest foreigner who will assist me in this
transaction.
Meanwhile the whole arrangements to put claim over this fund, as a payment
of
contract executed since it cannot be withdrawn locally and get the required
approval and transfer this money to a foreign account
has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed
to
you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assits us and
also
benefit yourself in this great business
opportunity. In fact I could have done this alone but because of my position
in
this country as a civil servant we are not allowed to operate a foreign
account
and would eventually raise an eyebrow on my
side during the time of transfer. This is the actual reason why it will
require
a second party or fellow, who will forward claim as the
contractor and also present a foreign account where the money would be
tranferred to as a payment for contract executed as it may be after due
verification by designated board.  I would not fail to inform you that this
transaction is 100% risk-free. On smooth conclussion of this
transaction, you would be entitlled to 30% as gratification,while 5% will be
set
aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer
and
also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and
my partners.
Please, you have been advise to keep top-secret as we are still in service
and
intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
be
monitoring the whole situation here until you confirm the money in your
account,and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
according
to percentages.  All other necessary information will be sent to you when I
hear
from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish
in
this deal.
Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Kazeem Ahmed
CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT
AWARDING COMMITTEE.
