MR. CHEUNG PUI

HANG SENG BANK LTD.

DES VOEUX RD. BRANCH,

CENTRAL HONG KONG,

HONG KONG.

 



Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr.Cheung Pui 

director of operations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd. I 

have an urgent business suggestion for you.



I honestly apologize and hope I do not cause you much 

embarrassment by contacting you through this means for 

a transaction of this magnitude,but this is due to 

confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this 

medium.Furthermore,due to this issue on my hands 

now,it became necesary for me to seek your assistance, 

and it is imperative for me to know your opinion



Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi 

Bassem who was with the Iraqi forces and also business 

man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar 

months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch. Upon maturity several 

notice was sent to him, even during the war early this 

year. Again after the war  another notification was 

sent and still no response came from him. We later 

find out that the Major and his family had been killed 

during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.



After further investigation it was also discovered 

that Major Fadi Basem  did not declare any next of kin 

in his official papers including the paper work of his 

bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time 

he was at my office that no one except me knew of his 

deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five 

Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying 

in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim 

it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws 

of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will 

revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if 

nobody applies to claim the funds. 



Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I 

will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of 

kin to Major Fadi Basem  so that you will be able to 

receive his funds. 



WHAT IS TO BE DONE:



I want you to know that I have had everything planned 

out so that we shall come out successful. I have 

contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary 

document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , 

all that is required from you at this stage is for you 

to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that 

the attorney can commence his job. After you have been 

made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in 

for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary 

approval and letter of probate in your favor for the 

move of the funds to an account that will be provided 

by you.



There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we 

are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney 

will prepare all the necessary documents. Please 

endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters 

concerning thisissue.Once the funds have been 

transferred to your nominated bank account we shall 

share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% 

for any expenses incure during the transaction. Should 

you be interested please send me your full names and 

current residential address and I will prefer you to 

reach me via my private box, 



{che_Pui67@yahoo.com.hk} and finally after that i shall provide you with more details of this operation.



Your earliest response to this letter will be 

appreciated.



Kind Regards,



Mr Cheung Pui.
