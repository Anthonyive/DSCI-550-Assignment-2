<body><p>FROM THE DESK OF MR HARRISON COMPAORE
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.WEST AFRICA


My Dear

I am Mr Harrison Compaore, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign 
remittance department of BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) here in Ouagadougou, Burkina 
Faso. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$39.5m dollars 
(thirty-nine million five hundred thousand US dollars) in an account that 
belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, 
Germany) who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane 
crash. for more information about the crash you can visit this site:( 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm)

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt 
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this 
discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and 
release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for 
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we 
don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after eight years, the money will be transferred into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision 
of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during 
the business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country 
for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable 
the immediate transfer of this fund to your arranged, you must apply first 
to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of 
application form that I will send to you when I hear from you, so I will 
like you to send to me your private telephone and fax number for easy and 
effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is 
hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all 
required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me 
immediately as soon as you receive this letter.

Trusting to hear from you immediately.
The manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of 
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A).

Best Regard
Mr Harrison Compaore.
