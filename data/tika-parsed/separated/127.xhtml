     REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE: _STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL


  I AM DR. OLUSEGUN SMITH, THE CHAIRMAN OF CONTRACT
AWARD AND REVIEW COMMITTEE SET UP BY THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA UNDER THE NEW CIVILIAN
DISPENSATION TO AWARD NEW CONTRACTS AND REVIEW
EXISTING ONES. I CAME TO KNOW OF YOU IN MY SEARCH FOR
A RELIABLE AND REPUTABLE PERSON TO HANDLE A VERY
CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTION, WHICH INVOLVES THE TRANSFER
OF A HUGE SUM OF MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT.
THERE WERE SERIES OF CONTRACTS EXECUTED BY A
CONSORTIUM OF MULTI-NATIONALS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY IN
FAVOUR OF N.N.P.C. THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF THESE
CONTRACTS WERE DELIBRATELY OVER INVOICED TO THE SUM
OF USD$25,000,000.00 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATE
DOLLARS). THIS AMOUNT HAS NOW BEEN APPROVED AND IS
NOW READY TO BE TRANSFERED BEING THAT THE COMPANIES
THAT ACTUALLY EXECUTED THESE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN FULLY
PAID AND THE PROJECTS OFFICIALLY COMMISSIONED.
CONSEQUENTLY, MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE WILLING TO
TRANSFER THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO YOUR ACCOUNT FOR
SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT, SINCE WE AS CIVIL SERVANTS
ARE PROHIBITED BY THE CODE OF CONDUCT BUREAU (CIVIL
SERVICE LAW) FROM OPERATING AND/OR OPENING FOREIGN
ACCOUNTS IN OUR NAMES. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE TRUST
REPOSED ON YOU AT THIS JUNCTURE IS ENORMOUS, IN
RETURN, WE HAVE AGREED TO OFFER YOU 30% OF THE
TRANSFERED SUM, WHILE 10% SHALL BE SET ASIDE FOR
INCIDENTAL EXPENSES (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL) BETWEEN
BOTH PARTIES IN THE COURSE OF THE TRANSACTION YOU WILL
BE MANDATED TO REMIT THE BALANCE TO OTHER ACCOUNTS IN
DUE COURSE.
MODALITIES HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL
OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THE CENTRAL BANK OF
NIGERIA FOR THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE FUNDS WITHIN
10 WORKING DAYS SUBJECT TO YOUR SATISFACTION OF THE
ABOVE STATED TERMS. OUR ASSURANCE IS THAT YOUR ROLE IS
RISK FREE.TO ACCORD THIS TRANSACTION THE LEGALITY IT
DESERVES AND FOR MUTUAL SECURITY OF THE FUNDS THE
WHOLE APPROVAL PROCEDURES WILL OFFICIALLY AND LEGALLY
PROCESSED WITH YOUR NAME OR THE NAME OF ANY COMPANY
YOU MAY NOMINATE AS THE BONEFIDE BENEFICIARY.
ONCE MORE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING PUT IN
OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE OF MY
COUNTRY, I AM AVERSE TO HAVING MY IMAGE AND CAREER
DENTED. THIS MATTER SHOULD THEREFORE BE TREATED WITH
UTMOST SECRECY AND URGENCY IT DESERVES.AND I WILL LIKE
YOU TO SEND ME YOUR MAIL TO MY PRAIVTE BOX
dr.olusegun.smith@caramail.com
I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL IS
100% RISK FREE AS WE HAVE DONE OUR HOME WORK PROPERLY
I QUITE BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL PROTECT OUR INTEREST BY
TAKING THIS DEAL STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL, AS WE ARE
STILL IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE, WHICH WE INTEND TO RETIRE
FROM.KINDLY EXPEDITE ACTION AS WE ARE BEHIND SCHEDULE
TO ENABLE US INCLUDE THIS TRANSFER IN THE SECOND BATCH
WHICH WOULD CONSTITUTE THE FIRST QUARTER PAYMENTS FOR
THE 2003 FINANCIAL YEAR. THANKS AND GOD BLESS.

DR.OLUSEGUN SMITH


NB:
BUT IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE INTERESTED LET ME KNOW. LIST
YOUR PHONE &amp; FAX NUMBERS SO WE MAY
COMMUNICATE WITH YOU. THIS IS IMPORTANT AS WE WOULD
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE MODALITIES OF THE TRANSACTION.
WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU.
