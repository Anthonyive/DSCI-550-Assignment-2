<title>REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASSISTANCE</title>
</head>
<body><p>&gt;From :The Desk Of : Mr James 
Nigerian National Petroleum Company
Contract Awarding Committee
Member: Executive Council. 

Dear Friend,

REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASSISTANCE 

I am James Abure, I know this 
letter may come to you as a surprise but it was borne out of my sincere 
desire to share a mutual business relationship with you. First, your 
strictest confidence in this transaction is highlt solicited. 

This is 
by virtue of its nature as being confidential and top secret. 
I am a 
government official with a statutory corporation and a member of an 
adhoc committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to review 
contracts awarded by past administration. In the course of identifying, 
scrutinizing and recommending payment for all valid contracts executed, 
we discovered a huge sum of money amounting to US$ 75.5 million 
(Seventy-five million five hundred thousand dollars) on grossly over-
invoiced contract already awarded and executed for the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation. 

Having cleaned the Augean Stable, we 
intend to transfer the balance of US$ 75.5 million presently floating 
in our Apex Bank of Nigeria to our own benefit and advantage. However 
we ask for your unwavering assistance in this regard because as civil 
servants we are prohibited under the civil service code of conduct from 
operating a foriegn account or running a foreign company unless after 
retirement. In this vain we want you to front for us as a partner to 
enable us lodge the funds speedily into your account. 

Bear in mind 
that no risk is attached to this project and all logistics are in place 
and modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion within a stipulated 
time. This is in accordance with the fact that you must never betray 
the trust already reposed on you. We have decided to compensate you 
with 30% of the total sum for your support, 60% for us, while 10% is 
mapped out for miscellaneous expenses ( local and international). 

Please if interested, provide your confidential phone and fax number to 
enable me contact you for further discussion on this matter. Please 
advise in your return mail, which time is confidential enough to call 
you. And also call me if you are interested in the proposal with this 
number - 234 8 

Looking forward to hear from you. 

Best Regards, 
James Abure.
