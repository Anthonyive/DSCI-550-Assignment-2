<title>Re: Inquiry From Kevin</title>

<body><p>Good day,

I am Mr. Kevin Garforth,staff of Cater Allen Private Bank. I am contacting
you concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our
banks management three years ago.I Would respectfully request that you
keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of
the information you come by as a result of this mail.I am contacting you
independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this
communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I
believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2002, the subject matter;
came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private
banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of Six
Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us turn over
(invest) on his behalf.

I was the officer assigned to his case, I made numerous suggestions in
line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the
private banking sector then, especially given the volume of funds he
wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any
investments being placed.I encouraged him to consider various growth funds
with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to
start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and
2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spun the
money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our
first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this
point at over Two million United States Dollars, this margin was not the
full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on
investments.

In mid 2003, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to
make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He
directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I
informed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have
this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have
to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and
statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around
when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.

Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the
incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available
to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I
followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds
deposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist
private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and
blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake
transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly
private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and
well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was
deposited with the security firm.

The deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his
arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we
had, this transpired around 25th of November 2003.In June last year, we
got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of
that particular portfolio.This was an astounding position as far as I was
concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector I was
the only one who knew about the deposit at the security firm, and I could
not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim his deposit.
I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.

I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal
investigations department of Cater Allen.Four days later, information
started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A person who suited
his description was declared dead of a heart attack in canne, in Southern
part of France.We were soon enough to identify the body and cause of death
was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into
possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to
come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking
affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but
also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his
bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking,
opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence,
accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to
make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors
of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring
that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they
nominate next of kin.

 Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also
usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the deceased
died without a testate. In line with our internal processes for account
holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in
good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This
investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned
every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to
get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted in
my being furnished with your details as a possible relative of the
deceased.

My present official capacity as the Head of Finance dictates that I am the
only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive
the results of the investigation. What this means,is that our dear late
fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This leaves me as
the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is
in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit.
According to practice, The Security Firm will by the end of this financial
year broadcast a request for statements of claim to Cater Allen, failing
to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back
to Cater Allen.This will result in the money entering the Cater Allen
accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the
private banking division.

This will not happen if I have my way. What I wish to relate to you will
smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is
only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of
the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is
fraught with huge rewards for those that occupy certain offices and
oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together
the general direction of what I propose. There is Six Million dollars
deposited in a security firm, I alone have the deposit details and they
will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I
alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as my Bank  is
concerned.

The transaction with our late customer concluded when I sent the funds to
the security firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file
are just customer services and due process. The security Firm has no
single idea of what�s the history or nature of the deposit. They are
simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that come
forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money
trying to track this man�s family; they have investigated for months and
have found no family. The investigation has come to an end.

My proposal:I now seek your permission to present you  as a next of kin to
the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you
the beneficiary to the funds $6,000 000 00 (Six Million United states
Dollar) ; I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The
security Firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving
relation. Upon receipt of the deposit,I am prepared to share the money
with you. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have
them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 60/40.I would have
gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would have
drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit.I
assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few
days.

 I will simply inform Cater Allen of the final closing of the file
relating to the deceased. I will then officially communicate with The
Security Firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these
two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have The
Security Firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account
holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the
money from The Security Company. We can fine-tune this based on our
interactions am aware of the consequences of this proposal.I ask that if
you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I
ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no
appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.

Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You
may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of
comparable situations run the whole private banking sector.I am not a
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good  conscience, this may
be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates
that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a
lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in
total control of my destiny.

These chances won�t pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance,
if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life
but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to
provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project
and it is a task well worth undertaking.I have evaluated the risks and the
only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my
bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has
blessed you with a luck that has planted you into the center of relevance
in my life. Let�s share the blessing. If you find yourself able to work
with me, contact me through this email account. If you give me positive
signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion.

I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I
will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you
contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting
me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers
I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want
any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are not secured
lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer
care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.Please observe this
instruction religiously.

Please, again, note that I am a family man, I have a wife and children. I
send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the
consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained
and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This
is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not
betray my confidence.

Mr. Kevin Garforth.
