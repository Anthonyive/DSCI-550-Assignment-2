Greetings to you,

 

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.My name is Mr.Henry Carr, the present branch Manager of a bank here in Nigeria West Africa. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. LikeI said, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required as a foreigner.

 

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our branch in Lagos who passed on,so that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $10.5 million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years.From my investigation,I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev a Russian big time Oildealer, who unfortunately lost his life in the Yak-40jetliner on March 9, 2000. You will read more news about the crash on visiting these site; 

http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml and

http://news.1chinastar.com/ll/english/61934.shtml.

 

I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has come forward to claim the  money as next of kin to the late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev meaning that no one is aware of the account. I can not directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you.I am seeking your co -operation to present you as the next of kin to the account. There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law.If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work together,so as to give you more details.

Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.

 

Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.

 

I wait your urgent response.


Regards,


Mr.Henry Carr
