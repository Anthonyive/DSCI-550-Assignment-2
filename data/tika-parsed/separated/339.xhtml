FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLUEM RESOURCES(F.M.P.R)

LAGOS NIGERIA.

ATTN:SIR,

      REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE- STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

 I am Dr VINCENT UMEH, an accountant in the Ministry of petroleum Resources 
(MPR) and a member of a three-man Tender Board in charge of contract review and 
payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to 
handle a very confidential transaction that involves the transfer of a huge sum 
of money to a foreign account. It may sound strange but exercise patience and 
read on. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium Multinational 
in the Oil industry in favor of Ministry of Petroleum Resources among which 
were: 

1. The extension of pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil, Down stream 
products distribution and subsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million. 

2. Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in 
the country~ US$ 152Million. 

3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (Depots) US$240 
Million. The original values of this contract were deliberately over invoiced 
to the sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has now been approved and 
is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed 
these contracts has been fully paid and project officially commissioned. 
consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to 
your account for subsequent disbursement since we are Civil Servant and are 
prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Servant Laws) from opening 
operating foreign account in our names. Needless to say, the trust posed on you 
at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the 
transferred sum while 10% shall be set aside for accidental expenses (Internal 
&amp; External) between the parties in the course of the transfer. We will mandate 
you to draw up an investment plan for us of which you will control since we 
cannot bring our shares back to Nigeria. We are very interested in investing in 
real estate in your country. You must however note that this transaction is 
subjected to the following terms and conditions: 

1. Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence. 

2. That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality because of the circumstances we now find ourselves. 

3. That the funds would be transferred to an account over which you have 
absolute control. Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the 
presidency at the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the 
funds within 14 working days, subject to your satisfaction of the above stated 
terms. Our assurance is that your role is 100% risk free. To accord this 
transaction, the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the parties 
involved and the funds, the whole approval procedures will be officially and 
legally processed with your name or the name of your company you may nominate 
as the bonafide beneficiary. Also, be informed that our main reason of 
contacting you is for the obvious reason that we will want to invest these 
funds in the real estate. It is our believe that you can be ofimmense help in 
this regards. Kindly expedite action so as to enable us include this 
transaction into this batch as payment to foreign contractors is usually 
carried out on quarterly basis. Please, contact me as soon as possible on my 
private e-mail address: vumeh703@yahoo.com

Best regards,

DR.VINCENT UMEH
