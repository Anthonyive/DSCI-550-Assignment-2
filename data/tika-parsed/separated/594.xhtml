<body><p>: Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha.

I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha, from Kuwait. I am married to 
Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed 
memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine 
years before he died in the year 
2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died 
after a brief illness that lasted 
only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and 
I was a devoted Christian by 
birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my 
late husband was alive, he 
deposited the sum of $25.5million dollars (twenty five million, 
five hundred dollars), which he in
herited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an 
overseas finance and security firm. 
Presently, this money is still with finance and security firm. 
Recently, my doctor told me that I 
had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next 
four months. 

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either 
a Christian organization or a 
devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way 
I am going to instruct here in.
  

I want this Christian organization or individual to use this 
money in all sincerity to fund 
churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of God 
and to ensure that the society 
upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible 
emphasized so much on the giving 
of alms, charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold 
step. I took this decision 
because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives 
are all Muslims and I don't want 
my husband&amp;#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call 
me an unbeliever.

I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an 
unholy manner hence the reasons for 
taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with 
God the highest and the most 
merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will 
only give you the contact of my 
lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making 
you the beneficiary of the 
consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this 
letter and accept to assist me 
to conclude this transaction, if you want to speak with me he 
will arrange for that because my 
doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I 
can't discuss in the presence of
my husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the 
hospital, my lawyer is the only person 
that knows the decision that I am taking.

With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I 
receive your reply through my 
lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the 
beneficiary of the consignment and all 
necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall 
also give you the contact of the
finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of 
authority that will prove you as the 
original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian 
community where you reside to 
always pray for me. 

My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian 
though married to a Muslim, 
whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in 
spirit, please always be prayerful 
all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room 
in souring for another Christian
organization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose. 

Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your 
shoulders, may the Almighty God 
continue to guide and protect you. Amen. 

Yours faithfully, 

PLEASE REPLY THROUGH MY ATTORNEYS PRIVATE EMAIL:kufor100@yahoo.com

Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha.
