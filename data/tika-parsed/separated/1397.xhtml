FROM THE DESK OF:

DR EVANS UBAH, BANK MANAGER.

CONTINENTAL TRUST BANK OF NIGERIA PLC}

NO 77, MARINA ISLAND

 LAGOS.

 

 

ATTENTION:

 

NEW YEAR WISHES

 

Firstly, My warmest regards to you and your family this new year as I pray you all are well in the name of the Most High God. 

 

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am Evans  Ubah, A

Key Managerial Staff at the Continental Trust Bank PLC, Lagos. I came to know of you

in a my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a

 very

confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of 

money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

A foreigner, Late Engineer William �., an oil Merchant /contractor 

With the Federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a

ghastly air crash, banked with us here at the Continental Trust Bank 

PLC,Lagos,and had a closing balance of USD$22.2M (Twenty-Two Million, Two Hundred

Thousand United States Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably

 

expectsto be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or 

alternativelybe donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a 

military war collage here in Nigeria.

 

Fervent valuable efforts are being made by this bank to get in touch 

With any of late Engr. William 's next of kin (he had no known wife and

children), but all our efforts proof abortive. Right now, the 

managementand the Board of directors of this bank has made an arrangement for the

fund to be declared "UNCLAIMABLE " and then be subsequently donated to 

thetrust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which will further enhance the 

courseof war in Africa and the world in general. In order to avert this 

negativedevelopment, myself and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now 

seekfor your permission to have you stand as late Engr.WILLIAMS �s

nextof kin

 so that this fund (USD$22.2M) would be subsequently transferred 

and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next of kin.

 

All documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been 

carefullyworked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your 

sharewould be 30% of the total amount. 10% has been set aside for expenses, 

while the rest would be for myself and my colleagues for purposes in your 

country.

 

If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to take advantage of 

The trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get to me

 

Immediately via my e-mail address furnishing me with your most confidential telephone,fax and e-mail, so that I can forward to you the relevant details of this transaction.

 

PLEASE CONTACT ME THROUGH THIS E-MAIL ADDRESS(foba700yahoo.com)

FOR SECURITY REASONS.

 

Thank you in advance for your

 anticipated co-operation.

 

Regards.

 

Dr. famous oba
