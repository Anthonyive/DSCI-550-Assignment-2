<body><p>KAMBILI BOB
3/5 RIDES GARDEN
CLOSE JO'BURG,
SOUTH AFRICA

MY DEAR , 

I am Bob Kambili, Bank manager of First national bank
South Africa Pty, South Africa,(www.fnb.co.za) and for
reasons which will become obvious to you as read on, I
obtained your address particulars from an Internet
address listing. Please exercise some patience and
read through my message.  You can reach me immediately
on my private email address  (henryfnbsa@mail.com)

I have a very urgent and confidential business 
proposition for you. On June 6th 1998, a Gold
Consultant/Contractor with the South African National
Gold Corporation, Mr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa , a
national of Iraq, made a numbered time ( fixed)
deposit for 12 calendar months, value 
USD52,000,000.00 (FIFTY TWO MILION DOLLAS)  in my
branch. 

On maturity, we sent a routine notification to his 
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, 
we sent a reminder and finally, his contract 
employers, the South African National Gold Corporation
wrote to inform us that Mr. A Y Mustafa died from an
automobile accident; that he died without making a
WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin
through the Iraqi embassy were fruitless. At first I
was surprised that I did not receive much official
cooperation in my inquiries in order to trace his kin
in Iraq, and inform them about Mr. Mustafa�s deposit
of USD52m plus accrued interest. I therefore made
further investigations and discovered that Mr. Mustafa
had actively opposed the Government of President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and was consequently driven
into exile. Being an minning Expert,he subsequently
obtained a job with the South Africa Gold Coporation, 
and settled in South Africa. Thereafter, he walked
into my Office to make the aforementioned deposit of
USD52m. He did not declare any kin in his application
paperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and when
I asked him he informed me that he wished it so. I
accepted his application because banks are
conservative and will always honour a customer�s
wishes, especially high networth customers. No one
knows the source of his money because apparently the
time frame of his employment with the ASGC does indeed
preclude such a large amount of money. It can be
assumed that he brought his money over from Iraq, but
that is open to speculation. However, the point is
that his employers are not aware of this money , and
therefore it can be safely assumed that no one will
ever come forward to claim this money. This money
total USD52m ( inclusive of accrued interests) is
still sitting in my Bank in the Dormant Account
Portfolio. No one will ever come forward to claim it
now, and according to South African law, 
after 5 years, the money will automatically revert 
to the Federal Government Treasury if the Account 
owner is a foreigner, is certified dead , and there is
no valid claim. This indeed, is the situation. My
proposal therefore is that I am looking for a 
foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to 
Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood 
relation to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is
not also necessary to come from the same Country. I
have worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of
appointing a next of kin, and therefore also by this
means transfer this money total USD52m abroad for us
to share. 

The method of achieving the objective of 
transferring this money abroad in a completely legal
and proper way is simple. I intend to use a n Attorney
( representing you as BENEFICIARY) to execute a series
of affidavits in support of your claim. These will be
approved. 

The money transfer paperwork itself will include a 
certificate of origin so that the receiving bank 
does not ask questions or refuse the money as money 
laundering. Also, the paperwork will include proper 
certification that the funds being transferred are 
from non criminal sources. In short this will be a 
proper and legal money transfer and there is no 
risk!.
 
I will have to process the initial paperwork to 
obtain approval from the Probate Registry ( Ministry
of Justice ) to obtain the Letter of Administration
empowering you as Sole trustee/executor to the Estate
of Mr. Mustafa. 

If you therefore agree to be the official 
Beneficiary, then please note that you will not be 
required to sign any Money Transfer Documents ( my
Attorney will do all (that), you will not be required
to come to South Africa. 

Only the following is required from you: 
(1) Send to me immediately A bank account ( a bank 
account with zero credit balance is ok) 
(2) Complete name and address of the Bank 
(3) Bank Account Number 
(4) Name of Account Holder/Beneficiary 
(5) Your address, phone and fax 
(6) A brief background information on you (CV) 
Once you send me the requested information as 
above, I will initiate the processing of the transfer
and in about 7 working days the money total USD52m
will be in your nominated bank account for us to share
in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. This
transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any
problems. If you agree to assist me by sending me the
above requested information, I will give you my
complete address, including phone/ fax etc and any
further clarifications you may require. 
Looking forward to your urgent reply. 

Yours truly 

Kambili.
