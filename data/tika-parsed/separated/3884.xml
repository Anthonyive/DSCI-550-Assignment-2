Dear Sir,



I am Barrister Al Mohammed El Said, Former Legal/family Attorney to the

 ousted Iraqi President General Saddam Hussein. I was Tortured and

 Incarncerated for speaking out against the Devilish and Inhumane

 actions of

 his son Uday Hussein.



While i was working with the former President, i was entrusted with

 many assets and Funds which i was keeping safe for the family, upon my

 release from Prison. all the assets and funds in my possession were

 all

 retrieved except a certain Fund amounting to the tune of

 $40,000,000.00(Forty Million United States Dollars) which is proceeds

 from Crude Oil

 sales of one of his numerous Oil Companies and registered with a

 foreign

 name under a Foreign Account and i am the only person who knows about

 this Fund and also has all the necessary informations and Documents

 about the account which i will give to you.



It is in view of the above facts that i am contacting you as a

 foreigner to help in transferring this Money abroad into your account

 as the

 current restrictions on travelling and the Fact that the Funds is in a

 foreigner's name under a Foreign Account therefore the Bank officials

 will wellcome any foreigner with correct information about the account

 which i will give to you.



Also there are other factors which has made it impossible for me to do

 it as it was only possible for me to escape from Iraq to Kuwait from

 where i am currently contacting you.



We are going to sign a Binding agreement of Trust to makle sure that

 none of the parties involved will be cheated in the transaction as i

 will

 travel along with my family to your Country for sharing and

 Investments as soon as the ban on travelling and other restrictions is

 lifted.



You also have to note that after the successful transfer of the fund to

 your account, it will be shared as follows: you will be given 35% of

 the Total Fund for your services, 60% will be for me while the

 remaining

 5% will be for expenses incurred in the course of the transaction.



I look forward to your positive and co-operative response.



Yours,



Barrister Al Mohammed El Said.
