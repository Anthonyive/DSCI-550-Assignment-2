It is by the grace of God that I 
received Christ,Having known the
truth, I had no choice than to do what is 
lawful and right in the sight
of God for eternal life and in the sight of man 
for witness of Gods
mercy and glory upon my life.
I am Mrs Melissa Pointer 
the wife of Mr Harry Pointer, my husband
worked with the Chevron/Texaco in 
Kenya for twenty years before he died
in the year 2001.We were married for 
ten years without a child.
My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted 
for only four days.
Before his death we were both born again 
Christians.
Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside 
my
matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband 
was
alive he deposited the sum of US $3.5M. (Three Million Five 
Hundred
Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe.
Presently, this 
money is still with the Bank and the management just
wrote me as the 
beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of
this money or rather 
issue a letter of authorization to somebody to
receive it on my behalf if I 
can not come over.
Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been 
undergoing
treatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to 
talk
and my doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It 
is
my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations 
any
where in the World.
Because relatives and friends have plundered so 
much of my wealth since
my illness, I cannot live with the agony of 
entrusting this huge
responsibility to any of them.
Please, I beg you in 
the name of God to help me Stand
and collect the Funds from the Bank.
I 
want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund
churches, 
orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to
ensure that the 
house of God is maintained.
The Bible made us to understand that blessed is 
the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don't have any child 
that will inherit
this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and 
I don't want
my husband's hard earned money to be misused by 
unbelievers.
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an 
ungodly
manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not 
afraid of
death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be 
in
the bosom of the Lord.
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my 
case and I shall hold
my peace.
I don't need any telephone communication 
in this regard
because of my soundless voice and presence of my husband's 
relatives
around me always. I don't want them to know about this 
development.
With God all things are possible.
As soon as I receive your 
reply I shall give you the contact of
Attorney who is in Europe as he will be 
the one to assist you in laying
claims for this funds.
Please send all 
emails to :mothermrsmelissa1@yahoo.gr
 
Yours in 
Christ,
 
Melissa Pointer
 
God bless 
you
