<title>Greetings From Mrs James Mason</title>
</head>
<body><p>Greetings,
   My name is Mrs. James Mason. I am a dying woman who has decided  to donate what I have to you/church. I am 59 years old and I was diagnosed for cancer for about 2 years ago.Immediately after the death of my husband, who has left me with everything he worked for.I have been touched by God to donate from what I had inherited from my late husband to  you for the good work of God, rather than allow my relatives to use my husband hard earned funds ungodly. Please pray that the good Lord forgive me my sins.I have asked God to forgive me and I believe he has because He is a merciful God. I will be going in for an operation in less than one hour. I decided to WILL/donate the sum of $1,500,000 (One million five hundred thousand dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and also to help the motherless and less privilege and also for the assistance of the widows. 
 At the moment ,I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the!
  fact that my relatives are around me and my health status.I have adjusted my WILL and my lawyer is aware I have changed my WILL. You and he will arrange the transfer of the funds from my Uk Island Bank Account to your Bank.I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good work to others. Contact my lawyer Barr. David .S.Roth  with this specified email "<a shape="rect" href="mailto:davidroth1960@yahoo.co.uk">davidroth1960@yahoo.co.uk</a>  or <a shape="rect" href="mailto:davidroth1960@eriga.lv">davidroth1960@eriga.lv</a>,  and tell him that I have WILLED ($1,500,000.00) to you by quoting my personal reference number 
law/chamber/solicitors/je/ws/WILL/1144520012 and I have also notified him that I am WILLING that amount to you for a specific and good work.I do know that I am not used to you but I have been directed to do this.</p>
