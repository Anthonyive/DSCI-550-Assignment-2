London-England
barnett_scott@web2mail.com

I am sorry for contacting you through this medium without a previous
notice, I had to use the E-mail because it is an easier

and more confidential way of making contact with people around the world.
My name is Barrister Barnett Scott,a forty five (45)
year old Attorney in practice here in London-England. I had a client by
name Mr.Victor a contractor based in Sri-
lanka/Indonesia now deceased. My client lost his life alongside his wife
and only child in aceh sri-lanka. Details of this
incidence can be checked on the following
website;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4143487.stm
prior to the death of my late client, He secured a contract of
$12,500,000.00 million from the sri-lanka/Indonesia
government, following which he received a 30%mobilization fee of
US$3,750,000.00 Million and successfully executed the
contract, but the balance of US$8,750,000.00 Million contract payment was
in the Process of being transferred into my late
client's account which he submitted to the government when he lost his
life in the incidence.
Few days after his sudden Death,The government of Indonesia effected the
transfer of the balance of his Contract Funds into
the account that my late client has on his file with the government. As
his personal Attorney before his death,I have been
officially notified and instructed by the bank here in U.K where the money
is currently deposited that I should provide and
forward the particulars of Mr.Victor's next of kin so that the Funds in
his account can be remitted into his Next of Kin's
account in accordance with British Laws.

However, as the personal attorney and close confidant of late Mr.Victor, I
want you to know that my late client died
interstate, i.e, He died without leaving a Will.Hence,all my efforts to
locate any of his relative whom I can present to the
bank has proved abortive.
Therefore I am seeking for your consent to present you as the deceased
relative/next of kin and subsequently the beneficiary
of the fund so that the proceed of this account valued at US$12,500,000.00
Million can be paid to you for subsequent
disbursement between you and I. If you can cooperate with me and receive
this funds as next of kin to Mr.Victor, confirm your
interest by contacting me through my E-mail:- barnett_scott@web2mail.com
I can assure you that the deal is 100% risk free because i am in possesion
of the deceased personal file which contains all
information which I shall use to prove your relationship with the deceased
therefore the money will be paid into the account
of whomever I present as Mr.Victor's Next of kin with proofs that I will
present to the bank when needed.
When I receive a positive response and after proper discussion with you, i
will furnish you all relevant information that will
facilitate the release of the Funds to you. An Application will have to be
filed to the Bank for processing of the release of
the funds into your nominated bank account.

I wait to hear from you.
Barrister Barnett Scott.
