RE-BUSINESS ENQUIRY

Dear Sir.

I am Mr. Greg  Thambo  a South African and a senior civil servant  (General 
supervisor) with South African Gold and Diamond Mining and Processing  
company Krugersdrop, the immediate younger brother to Mr. Oliver Thambo  
(African National Congress- ANC) who  died in Johannesburg after a long  
illness after  he returned to South Africa in 1990 following many years
of  living in exile, including in Tanzania , Sweden.

On the 24th April 1994, when apartheid was dismantled, the South  African  
Government decided to compensate the families of all the Freedom  Fighters  
who lost their lives during the struggle by placing the educated elites  in  
high offices in South African Government.( KNOWN AS BLACK EMPOWERMENT  
PROGRAMME HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA) among which my family was included. For
instance, Nelson Mandela was compensated with being the first president of  
the Republic of South Africa; Richard Parkes was appointed the manager  of  
Shell and BP South Africa petroleum and refinery (S.A.P.R), Jeff Radebe  was 
  appointed the Minister of public Enterprises and Trevor Manual was  
appointed  the Finance Minister.

In fact, I got your contact / credibility from South African  information  
exchange assisted by the south African Chamber of Commerce and Industry  
where I however read your company profile believing in its reputable  
capability as regards my intensive purposes to you.

As a matter of fact, I have accumulated sufficiently USD$5 MILLION(Five  
Million United States Dollars) by virtue of my position in the office  as a  
senior civil servant in the South African Gold and Diamond mining  company  
Krugersdrop.  Presently, this fund is absolutely kept in an insurance
suspense holding in a private security company in South Africa. The  
deposition of this fund was made easier for me with a very strong written  
agreement and signatory in a different beneficiary under my control.

Being a South Africa serving civil servant, it is very difficult for me to  
invest this fund here in my country�s the law strictly prohibits. If  the 
government got knowledge of it, the fund will be confiscated. I have no  
doubt that you understand this point very well. This fund is my  struggle 
and  sweat through commissions from unaccountable contracts and other  
profitable  additions from the company�s original cost price mostly gained 
from  customers around the world.

Therefore, my plan and intention about this fund is to transfer it overseas 
into a straightforward, trustworthy and God-fearing person�s less taxable  
account for investment purpose only. Using your name/company as the  
beneficiary of the fund to avoid my government�s intervention. Last  time, I
got in contact with some one from South Korea but he became  unnecessarily  
greedy concerning his commission in the deal before I decided to  contact  
you.

If you are interested in assisting me, please notify me immediately on  the 
above private telephone number or send me e-mail on my very  confidential  
e-mail address. But if you are not in position to assist me, please  
maintain  the high level of confidentiality needed in this Transaction.


Yours Faithfully.
Mr. Greg Thambo
