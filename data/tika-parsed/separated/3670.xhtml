<body><p>FROM: MOHAMMED WILLIAMS
JOHANNESBURG
REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA

Dear Sir,

                                   PRIVATE AND HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL

Greeting! I know you will be surprised to read from me, but please this 
letter is a request from a family in dire need of assistance. I am Mr. 
Mohammed Williams from Angola.The first and the only son of Brigadier Chanza 
Williams communicating to you from Johannesburg, South Africa.

I got your address from my random search at the net. And, I on behalf of my 
widowed mother Mrs. Bridget Williams  decided to solicit for your assistance 
to transfer the sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million Eight Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars), which he deposited in a safe box to private 
security company in Johannesburg, South Africa.

In fact, my father said, and I quote: ï¿½My son, I wish to draw your attention 
to US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States 
Dollars). I deposited the box containing the fund in a security company in 
Johannesburg, South Africa as valuables. During the war, I was very 
committed and dedicated in winning the war against the rebels, until I found 
out that the senior army officers and government functionaries were busy 
helping themselves with government funds and properties, sending them to 
foreign countries. Due to this, when the former adviser to the president and 
I were assigned by the president (JOSE EDUARDO SANTOS) to purchase arms in 
South Africa, we saw this as a golden opportunity and diverted the money and 
share it, of which I got a total sum of US$35.8 Million (Thirty five Million 
Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).

In case of my absence on earth as a result of death, only you should solicit 
for assistance of a reliable and sincere foreign partner to assist you to 
transfer this money out of South Africa for investment purpose. I deposited 
the box in your name and you can claim it alone with deposited code. Your 
mother is with all the documents. Take good care of your mother and your 
sisters.

&gt;From these words of my late father, you can understand that life and future 
of my family depend on this fund, as such I will be grateful if you can 
assist us. We are now living in South Africa as political asylum seekers. 
Financial laws and regulations of the Republic of South Africa do not permit 
us certain financial rights. In view of this, I cannot invest this fund in 
South Africa hence; I am seeking your assistance to transfer this fund out 
of South Africa for investment purpose. For your assistance, we are prepared 
to offer you 25% of the total fund while 5% will be set aside for any 
expenses incurred during this transaction.

Please note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the major thing I 
demand from you is to assure me the safety of this money when it finally 
gets to you. Further information and arrangement commence as soon as trust 
confidence and good relationship are established. I shall be most grateful 
if you maintain the confidentiality of this matter. Please, confirm your 
interest through the above contact telephone numbers or email.

Best regards,

MOHAMMED WILLIAMS.
{For the family}
