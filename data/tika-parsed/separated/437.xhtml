<body><p>ATTN:THE DIRECTOR,

DEAR SIR,

FIRST AND FOREMOST,I MUST SOLICIT YOUR STRICTEST CONFIDENCE IN THIS
TRANSACTION AND I PRAY THAT MY DECISION TO CONTACT YOU WILL BE GIVEN
GENUINE APPROVAL CONSIDERING THE FACTS WE HAVE NOT KNOWN EACH OTHER
BEFORE, I WISH TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO YOU.

I AM (MR. WILLIAM DONCUYUN) FROM LIBERIA, WEST AFRICA. I WRITE TO
INFORM YOU MY DESIRE TO INVEST, AND TO BUY A LIVING HOUSE IN YOUR
COUNTRY. I AM THE FIRST SON OF MR. WEAH DONCUYUN, MY FATHER WAS A
DIAMOND/GOLD MERCHANT IN MY COUNTRY.MY FATHER HAD A BULLET SHOT BY
THE REBELS ON HIS WAY TRAVELLING OUT OF MY COUNTRY WITH TWO OF MY
YOUNGER SISTER'S DUE TO PRESENT CRISIS THAT IS OCCURING IN OUR
COUNTRY (LIBERIA). MY SISTER'S DIED ON THE SPOT WHILE U.N.PEACE
MAKER, KEEPING FORCE RESCUED MY FATHER,HE WAS TAKEN TO HOSPITAL FOR
MEDICAL. TREATMENT WHICH HE LATER DIED. BEFORE HE DIED HE REAVEALED
TO ME AND MY MOTHER ABOUT THE BOXES CONTAINING: 85 KILO OF RAW GOLD
AND $12.5 MILLION, (TWELVE MILLION AND FIVE HUNDERED THOUSAND US
DOLLARS).
WHICH HE DEPOSITED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY IN GHANA FOR SAFE KEEPING.
MY FATHER DID NOT DISCLOSE ANY OF THE CONTENT OF THE BOXES TO THE
SECURITY COMPANY.TO AVIOD THE OFFICIALS FROM RAISING EYE BROWS TO THE
FUNDS. PRESENTLY MY MOTHER AND MYSELF ARE HERE IN GHANA TO NOTIFY THE
SECURITY COMPANY FOR THE CLAIMS, AND WE ARE STAYING IN THE REFUGEE
CAMP. THEREFORE I WANT YOU TO LECTURE ME ON HOW BEST WE CAN INVEST
THIS MONEY, BECAUSE MY FATHER TOLD ME THAT IT IS DANGEROUS TO INVEST
THIS MONEY IN AFRICA TO AVIOD SUSPICIONS, AND DUE TO MARKET
INSTABILITY COUPLED WITH ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY FACING
AFRICAN COUNTRIES, THAT IS WHY WE WANT TO INVEST IN ABROAD. FOR YOUR
MUTUAL ASSISTANCE, MY MOTHER AND MYSELF HAVE AGREED TO OFFER YOU 25%
OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE MONEY.

WE HAVE ALL THE VITAL DOCUMENTS COVERING THE DEPOSIT AND THE
OWNERSHIP WHICH I CAN SEND TO YOU THROUGH FAX ON REQUEST.

NOTE:I HAVE NEVER DISCLOSED THIS TO ANY PERSON APART FROM YOU,SO YOU
HAVE TO KEEP THIS TRANSACTION AS A TOP SECRET TO YOURSELF ALONE.WHICH
I WILL WANT YOU TO FORWARD ACROSS TO ME YOUR DIRECT TEL/FAX NUMBER
FOR MORE INFORMATIONS ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION.

I AM WAITING FOR YOUR URGENT AND POSITIVE FEEDBACK.

BEST REGARDS,

MR. WILLIAM DONCUYUN. (FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY)
