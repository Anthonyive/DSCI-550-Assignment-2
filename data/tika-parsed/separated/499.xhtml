<title>GREETINGS FROM MARK</title>
</head>
<body><p>DEAR SIR.


REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

First I must solicit your confidence in this
transaction, this is by vitue  of its’ nature as being very
CONFIDENTIAL. I am a member of Board of Directors with UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC,
LAGOS (UBN).  I came to know of you in  my private search for a
reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction, which
involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign Bank Account
requiring maximum confidence.

 THE PREPOSITION

 The late Engineer MARK JOHNSON a Foreigner and an oil
 merchant /contractor with the Federal Government of
 Nigeria until his death three years ago in a plane
 Nigeria Plc, Lagos and had a closing balance of usd
 28,900,000.00 (Twnety -Eight Million Nine Hundred
 Thousand Dollars) The bank now unquestionably expect
 it to be claimed by Mark Johnson’s next of kin.
 Priceless efforts have been made by the Union BANK PLC to get in touch
with any of the JOHNSON’S family but to no avail. It is becaue of the
perceived possibility of not being unable to  locate ENGR. MARK
JOHNSON’S next of kin that the management under the influence of our chairman
Board of Directors Major General Kalu Ike Kalu who has agreed that since
the incident occured in 1997 and has left the fund dormant and
devalued, we should transfer the fund overseas and ultilize it either on stock
exchange or personal business interest.

 Your role is very important as the fund when concluded on tranfer
would be justifiably presented as having been remited into the next of
kin’s bank account. Your interest will be protected as unecessary
documentation will be avoided and adequate percenta ge (%) sheduled for mutual
benefit.

 1. Account holder - 30% ( foreign partner)

 2. Nigeria partner - 60% ( Nigeria partner)

 3. 10% incidental expenses that might be incurred in
 the course of this transaction.

You are required to contact me on my E-mail address to indicate your
interest.

All parties interest should be protected in terms of
confidentiality. Note that all modalities necessary
for this transfer of this fund have been perfected and the transaction
is 100% risk free.

Awaiting your prompt response.

Regards,

MARK AKPU.
