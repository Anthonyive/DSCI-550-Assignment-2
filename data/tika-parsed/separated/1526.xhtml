<body><p>ATTN  PLEASE:                I NEED YOUR ADIVSE.

My Dear,

I know you will be suprise to recieve this proposal from someone you have
never seen before. In a nutshell I am Miss Ife  Williams Boko 25yrs old.The
Daughter of Late Dr Williams  ,who died alonge side with the former millitray
leather of the federal republic of Cote D' Ivoire,general Guei,during the coup
attemt by the rebells,which took the lifes of many people in my country. I am
constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment I,m receiving from my
step mother. She planned to take away all my late father's treasury and properties
 away from me since the unexpected death of my Father. Meanwhile I wanted to
escape to the United Sates but she stoled my international passport and other
valuable travelling documents.But luckily she did not discover where I hide my fathers
 deposite File where important documents are kept. So I decided to run to Dakar
Senegal for safety also to seek for asylum in the refugee camp to contact you
confidencially. She have even closed all my late father's , just to put me into suffery
and starvation. Now I urgently need an assistance of a reputable and trustworthy
 Foreigner who will help me to retrieve this money deposited by my late father in a
Finance House, l and subsequently stand on my behalf, as the next of kin. The money
 have been saved and deposited with a Finance House. He deposited the sum of
10.5M US dollars (ten point five million united state dollars.)I am here with the Deposite
 Certificate and the death certificate of my late father ,all will be sent to  you upon
 request as soon as i get you well, know body knows what i have and where i am. It t
herefore became very necessary and urgent that somebody in your foreign position
should render a helping hand to safe-guard this fund for me in safe until my arrival in your
 country.I am asuring you 100% rist free,and i have map out 15% of the total money for
 your kind assistance while 5% will be kept aside for any miscellaneous expenses incurred
. This is the reason why I decided to contact you. Please all communications(replies) s
hould be through this email address(ife_boko_williams@yahoo.co.uk )
for confidentialpurposes.Please your urgent responce will be highly appriciated.
Thanks
Miss Ife. B. Williams
