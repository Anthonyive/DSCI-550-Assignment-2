<body><p>FROM THE DESK OF MR  JAVED AHMED.
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A).
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO
WEST AFRICA.

Dear Friend,

I am the manager of bill and exchange department  BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) In 
my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $15m US dollars ( fifteen 
million US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer who died along with his entire family in november 1998 in a plane 
crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash 
leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release 
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety 
and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don�t want 
this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of 
this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision 
of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the 
business and 60 % would be for me and my colleagues.

Then after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement 
accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate 
trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank 
as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your 
bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and 
effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted . 
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free 
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required 
arrangements have been made for the transfer . you should contact me 
immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you 
immediately.  PLEASE MY DEAR  FRIEND THIS IS MY PRIVATE LINE YOU CAN  CALL   
ME IMMIDEATELY YOU RECEIVE THIS MAIL.  00226 (76  63  87 21)

THANKS
MR JAVED AHMED.
B.O.A (BANK OF AFRICA)
