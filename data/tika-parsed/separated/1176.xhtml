<body><p>CHALLENGE SECURITIES  AND FINANCE LTD
LAGOS, NIGERIA

ATTENTION:SIR

I am MR.ISA MUHAMEED, the Director of Operations
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in
NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute
with years of outstanding service to the people of
Africa.I have resolved to contact you through this
medium based on business proposal that will be of
mutual benefit to both of us.

I got your particulars through a consultant company
base on my research for atrustworthy and established
person that understands investment ethic for entering
into a life time profitable joint partnership
investment and also co-operation with confidence and
trust that you willkeep the contents secret and
divulged to any third party.

To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time
early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited
aconsignment in our company\'s vault for safe
keeping.And since then our client has failed to come
forward to claim his consignment, which has
accumulated aconsiderable amount of money in
demurrage.Consequently, in our bide to contact this
client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment
had accumulated we discovered that our client was the
former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who
died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same
year the consignment was entrusted into our care.Since
the death of our client President Mobutou Seseseko,
none of his benefactors has come forward to claim the
consignment with us, which means that non of his
relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment.
Hence out of curiosity I decided to secretly open the
two boxes that our client deposited in our vault. And
to my surprise I discovered that the two boxes that
were registered as treasurer by our client actually
contained a considerable amount of money in United
States Dollars amounting to about US$30 million
Dollar. Since this development I have been nursing
plans secretly. I also found out from enquiries and
the foreign media that our late client siphoned a lot
of money from his country while he was in office as
head of state.It is my conviction that the consignment
in our vault was part of the money that our client
siphoned and now that he is dead there is no race to
this money in our care.I am now soliciting your noble
assistance to assist me in transferring this money out
of nigeria to your country for immediate investment
with your assistance.I have also decided that you will
generously been titled to 30% of the total amount.
Upon my receiptof your reply confirming your
willingness to assist me of this transaction, I will
immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of
ownership of this consignment to your name to
facilitate your easy clearance and transfer of the
complete funds to yourcountry.
you have nothing to worry about, as I will be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper
documentation.

This transaction is 100% risk free.Please maintain
absolute confidentiality on this matter.
Please reply to the above email address with your
telephone and fax so can call you.
Thanks.
Yours faithfully.
MR.ISA MUHAMEED
