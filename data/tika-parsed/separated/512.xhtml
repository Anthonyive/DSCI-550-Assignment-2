                         Request For Foreign Partner

Dear Sir,

I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust to enable my
colleagues and I carry out an urgent business opportunity in my
department.
I work with the Union Bank of Nigeria PLC: currently I am the senior
manager of bills and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my
 bank. I was the account officer to one Mr. Ali B. Ashraf who died along
 with his family on the 8th of November 1998 in an ADC Boeing 747 plane
crash at Egirin River. All 141 passengers on board were feared dead.He
left
in his domiciliary account the total sum of $15.5million Fifteen million
 five hundred thousand USA Dollars. Since the management got the
information of his death we have been expecting any of his relation or
his next of kin to come up and claim his money. Unfortunately
from the day of his death till the time of this letter none of his
relation or friends has come up for the claim. The banking and financial
 law of Union
bank of Nigeria Plc stipulates that if such fund remained unclaimed
after a period of four (4) it will be transferred into the bank treasury
 as unclaimed bill.On this discovery sir, I and two other senior staffs
now
decided do business with you and release the money to you as the next of
 kin to Ali B. Ashraf for safety and subsequent disbursement. I will
soon proceed
for my retirement leave this year, and I personally do not want this
fund to be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. That is
 why I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I proceed on my
retirement.

The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this project is occasioned by
 the fact that the customer Mr. Ali Ashraf was a foreigner and a
Nigerian cannot
stand as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that
20% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner; thereafter my
colleague and I will visit your country for disbursement according to
the percentages
indicated.

To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into your nominated account,you
 will first apply to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased,indicating
 your bank account number and location wherein the money will be
remitted.Upon receipt of your acknowledgement indicating your interest,I
 will send to you the text of the application that you will send to the
Union Bank
authority for an approval to submit your claims.

Send your reply through my direct and private email
address:abdulkareem_39@rediff.com or abdulkareem_39@tiscali.co.uk indicates your direct Fax and telephone
 numbers for effective communication that this transaction needs. Do not
 reply through the union bank email address because it belonged to the
senior staffs for public use.

Please note that you are not to appear in person, as every thing
regarding this project will be strictly on documentations and every
banking documents needed for this transaction will be taken care of by
my self.

Looking forward to urgently hearing from you.

Yours Faithfully

ABDULKAREEM USMAN
