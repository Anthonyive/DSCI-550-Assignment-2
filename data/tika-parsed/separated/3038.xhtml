<body><p>FROM MR SUDIQ  BAWA
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO.


Dear Friend,

I am MR SUDIQ BAWA, The Bill and Exchange Manager at the Foreign Remittance 
Department of Bank Of AFRICA  (BOA).  I  have an urgent and very 
confidential business proposition for you.

On october 6, 2002, an American Geologist/Contractor with  the Economic 
Community Of West African States (ECOWAS), Dr. George W.Brumley From 
Atlanta,U.S.A Deposited the sum of US$15,500,000.00 (Fiften million Five 
hundred thousand Dollars only) in my bank. Upon maturity,I sent aroutine  
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we  
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the 
Economic Community Of West Africa States (ECOWAS) that Dr George W.Brumley 
died in a plane crash with his intire family in Kenya,East Africa in the 
year 2003.

I want you to visit the website below for more information about the Plane 
Crash:

http://www.wral.com/news/2345844/detail.html
http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that In the bank form 
for next of kin, George W.Brumley Before his death filled his wife JEAN 
BRUMLEY as his next of kin but unfortunately, the wife died with him along 
others and therefore, there is nobody left behind to claim the fund of
Dr. George Brumley as his next of kin that was why I contacted you and 
proposed it as a deal between us.

Meanwhile, Official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my 
Bank as the next of kin was in the name of his wife. Based on that, No one 
will ever come forward to claim it.According to the Burkina Faso Law,under 
Burkina's foreign and defense affairs,at the expirationof 3 (Three) 
years,such funds will revert to the ownership of the Burkina Faso Government 
for financing military operations,such as purchasing of arms and ammunitions 
for the military.

In order to avert this negative development, I will like to seek for your 
permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Dr.George W.Brumley 
so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for financing 
weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the world in 
general.

The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 55% 
for me and 40% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the 
transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork  for this 
transaction will be done accordingly and with my position as the bill and 
exchange guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.

If you are interested, please reply immediately through my private e-mail 
address: by indicating your bank name and address, Account number, phone and 
fax number for easy communication. Upon your response, I shall then provide 
you with more  details and that will help you understand the
transaction and also give you the text of the application to fill and send 
to the bank.

Finally, You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured  that 
this  transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall 
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Anxiously Awaiting for your urgent response.

Thanks and best regards to your family.
FROM MR SUDIQ  BAWA
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
