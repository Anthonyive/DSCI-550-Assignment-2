DEAR SIR,

I AM AN OFFICER CORPORATE BANKING DEPARTMENT OF RENNIES BANK

S.A.[SOUTH AFRICA] MY DEPARTMENT RELATES MORE WITH THE AFFAIRS

OF THE STATE. VERY LATELY AN AMOUNT OF MONEY WAS DISCOVERED BY

US IN A SUSPENSE / AN ABANDONED ACCOUNT TO THE SUM OF FIFTEEN

POINT THREE MILLION US DOLLARS ONLY. AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGED TO

ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY

ON NOVEMBER 1994 IN A GHASTLY PLANE CRASH. SINCE WE GOT

INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS

NEXT-OF-KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT

RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIED FOR IT AS NEXT- OF-KIN, OR

RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS INDI! C ATED IN OUR BANKING

GUIDELINES. UNFORTUNATELY, NOBODY HAS COME FOWARD TO CLAIM THIS

MONEY.IT IS BASED ON THIS THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN MY DEPARTEMENT

AND I HAVE DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A CORDIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH

YOU, HENCE MY CONTACTING YOU. WE WANT YOU TO PRESENT YOURSELF

AS THE NEXT-OF- KIN OR RELATION OF THE DECEASED SO THAT THE FUND

CAN BE REMITTED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. MOREOVER, WE DO NOT WANT THE

MONEY TO GO INTO THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS UNCLAIMED BILL.

THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATE THAT ANY ACCOUNT ABANDONED

OR IS DORMANT FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS IS DEEMED CLOSED AND ALL MONEY CONTAINED

THEREIN FORFEITED TO THE GOVERNMENT TREASURY ACCOUNT.

NOW IT IS BEING SPECULATED THAT THE ABOVE SUM WILL BE TRANSFERED

INTO THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND ON OR BEFORE

DECEMBER 2003. THE REASON FOR REQUESTING YOU TO PRESENT

YOURSELF AS NEXT-OF- KIN IS OCCA! SIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE

DECEASED (CUSTOMER) WAS A FOREIGNER.

THE MODE OF SHARING AFTER A SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE MONEY

INTO YOUR ACCOUNT: 70% TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I; FOR THE ROLE YOU

WILL BE EXPECTEDTO PLAY IN THIS DEAL, WE HAVE AGREED TO GIVE YOU

THIRTY PERCENT (25%) OF THE TOTAL SUM, AND 5% FOR THE EXPENSES

WE ARE GOING TO ENCOUNTER BY THE TWO PARTIES AT THE COURSE OF

THIS TRANSACTION.THEREFORE YOU ARE EXPECTED TO REPLY THIS

LETTER INDICATING YOUR READINESS AND INTEREST TO PARTICIPATE IN

THIS BUSINESS.

EXACT STEPS TO TAKE. I EXPECT YOUR URGENT RESPONSE THIS BY EMAIL

NOTE ALSO THAT FOR SECURITY REASONS I WOULD'T BE ABLE TO SPEAK

TO YOU DURING OFFICE HOURS HENCE I SHALL GIVE YOU MY PRIVATE

NUMBER WHERE YOU CAN ALWAYS REACH ME AT THE PROPER TIME.

PLEASE TREAT THIS BUSINESS ! PROPOSAL AS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

FOR SECURITY REASONS. AS ALL THE TOP OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN THE

BUSINESS HERE DO NOT WANT TO GET INTO TROUBLE AS A RESULT OF

INDECENT PUBLICITY.

KIND PERSONAL REGARDS,

MR. BEL-ZULU SANI AHMED
