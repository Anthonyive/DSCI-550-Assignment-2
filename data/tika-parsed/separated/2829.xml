<body>Dearest,

With whole confidence and belief,my thought saw your
name,as a reliableperson to co-operate in joint
venture partnership.

I am,Andrew Guei,from Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory
Coast) the son of General Robert Guei, who died on 19
September 2002, during the military coup'detat. As a
former Head of State My Father acquired and deposited
two diplomatic boxes with Continental security company
in Ghana,containing $15 million US Dollars each US$30M
in all ( Thirty million united states dollars in all
)including other vital family valueables.

Before he died arrangement was on,for him to move this
money to (Overseas) through a Diplomatic Immunity by
the Security Company.I am therefore contacting you for
an assistant so that the consignment should be claimed
from Continental security Company.If you can't be here
in person for the collection of the
consignment/fund,you can instruct Continental
 security
company to use there Diplomatic Immunity to ship the
consignments to your nominated country oversea.

Note that the company did not know the exact contents
of the boxes,it was rather labelled/registered as
family valuables for security reason.I will also need
your assistance for investing the money in your
country i shall be sending you all the documents
issued to my late father by Continental Security
Comapny after your acceptance,my mother and I have
agreed to compensate you with 30% from the total
Sum.Please note that time is not on our side.

I will appreciate if you can get in touch with me as
soon as possible so that I can give you more
nformation about my proposals.You should be assured
that there is nothing to worry about,as all the
arrangements will be handled legally and we will be
here to guide and advise you on what to do till the
consignmet gets to your postion.

You are to give us
 guarantee that the boxes will be
well secured on reaching your position and that you
will not take advantage of our situation nor seat on
the fund.

I will stop here until i hear positively from you.

AndrewÂ Guei,
(for the family)
