<body><p>FROM BARRISTER MARK TRAORE CHAMBERS,
LEGAL PRACTITIONER AND PUBLIC NOTARY &amp;
HIGH COURT REPRESENTATIVE
SUITE 202 OMEGA PLAZA, APAPA
LAGOS -NIGERIA.

Dear Sir/Ceo,

It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a
suprise. This is because we have not met before but i
am inspired to sending you this email by the huge fund
transfer opportunity that will be of mutual benefit to
the two of us.

However, I am Barrister Mark Traore ,the personal
Attorney to the late Engr. Steve Moore a national of
Isle of Man in UK, who used to work with Shell
Petroleum Development Company(SPDC) in Nigeria. On the
21st of April 1996, my client,his wife And their three
children were involved in a car accident along
gamu/Lagos Express Road.

Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event
of the accident, Since then I have made several
enquiries to several Embassies to locate any of my
clients extended relatives,this has also proved
unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful
attempts,I decided to trace his relatives over the
Internet to locate any member of his family but of no
avail, hence I contacted you.

I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind
by my client,I can easily convince the (Security Company in ABROAD) with
my legal practice that you are the only surviving relation of my client.
Otherwise the Estate he left behind will be confiscated or declared unserviceable
by the Security Company where this huge deposits were lodged.

Particularly, the Security Company Abroad was where the deceased deposited
valued at about $27million U.S dollars(twenty)seven million U.S.America
dollars).Conseqently,TheSecurity Company issued me a notice to provide the
next of kin or have the fund confiscated within the next ten official working
days.

since i have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for overseveral
years now.I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased,so
that the proceeds of this fund valued at $27million U.S dollars can be paid
to you by the Company delivering the Consignment to your door step, then
you and I can share the money. 55%to me and 40% to you,while 5% should be
for expenses or tax as your government may require.Your information such
as below:

1.your full name

2.Resident Address

3.Telephone/Fax Numbers,Is required for immedaite commence of this
transaction.

As a barrister of high standard, I have all necessary
legal documents that can be used to back up anyclaim
we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation
to enable us see this deal through.

I guarantee that this will be executed under
alegitimate arrangementthat will protect you from any
breach of the law.Please get in touch with me by my

further.
