<body><p>INVESTMENT MANAGER JOB PROPOSAL.
&gt; 
&gt;  Dear Friend,
&gt; 
&gt;  My name is Kenneth Kaseke from Zimbabwe, I am 21 years old.
&gt; And my mother died last year and my father has been long dead.
&gt; Before the death of my mother, she was a farmer and who
&gt; acquired wealth through the export of vegetables and other
&gt; edible goods. Before the death of my mother she had acquired a
&gt; total sum of $9,000,000.00 (Nine million dollars), which she
&gt; secretly deposited in a security company abroad(Europe).But
&gt; right now as the only child and only son of my late parents it
&gt; is now time for my inheritance, but I cannot do this because
&gt; of my age and I am presenting an asylum seeker here in the
&gt; netherland.And the Netherland government laws does not allow
&gt; asylum seekers to have bank accounts.And because of this I
&gt; cannot collect my money from the security company for proper
&gt; banking.And also because of my age and little experience with
&gt; large sum of money like this.
&gt; 
&gt; That is why I am now writing you and seeking your assistance.
&gt; I want you to represent me in Europe and be my investment
&gt; manager and beneficiary of this funds, so that you can help me
&gt; make claims and as well invest this money for me. I have
&gt; decided to give you 20% out of the total amount
&gt; ($9,!000.000.00),which would be $1.8M US dollars .While the
&gt; rest will be mine, which I plan to use in my educational
&gt; pursuit. And also I hope you can also get me out of  here by
&gt; assisting me in acquiring a visa to join you up after you have
&gt; collected the money. I know this might sound strange to you,
&gt; but I don't have a choice and I want you to assist me by been
&gt; my investment manager and also give me a good education which
&gt; i couldn't get since the death of my mother.
&gt; 
&gt;  If you are ready to assist me, please get back to me through
&gt; this email address(kkzim@email.com),and I will feed
&gt; you with all the necessary information's and documents
&gt; regarding this proposal. I am hoping to hear from you soon.
&gt; Please do not let me down or turn away from me. I am begging
&gt; you in Gods name.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours Truly,
&gt; Kaseke Kenneth
&gt; 


</p>
