<body><p>MR. SIMON WONG
DAH SING BANK LTD.
19 DES VOEUX RD.
CENTRAL HONG KONG,
HONK KONG.

I am Mr.Simon Wong credit officer of the Dah Sing Bank Ltd.
I have a concealed business suggestion for you.Before the U.S and Iraqi
war, our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was with the Iraqi forces
and
also business man made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months,
with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred thousand United State
Dollars
only in my branch.
Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war early
this year. Again after the war another notification was sent and still
no
response came from him. We later find out that the General and his
family
had been killed during the war in bomb blast that hit their home.
After further investigation it was also ?discovered that Gen. Ibrahim
Moussa did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including
the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last
time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in
my
bank.So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is
still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.
What
bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at
the expiration three years the funds will revert to the ownership of
the
Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this
backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner
to
stand as the next of kin to Gen. Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be
able
to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we
shall
come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the
necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to
Gen.Ibrahim
Moussa,all that is required from you at this stage is for you to
provide
me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence
his
job.After you have been made the next of kin,the attorney will also
fill
in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and
letter
of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that
will
be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we
are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all
the
necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in
all
matters concerning this issue.Once the funds
have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in
the
ratio of 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% for any expenses incurred
during
the course of this operation.

Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax
numbers
for easy Communication and i will provide you with more details of this
operation.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards.
Simon Wong.
