<title>Urgent From Mrs Alice.</title>
</head>
<body><p>DEAR ONE

I am Mrs Alice Lancson ,I am pleading to get across to you for a very 
urgent and profitable business proposal, though I don't know you 
neither have I seen you before but I got your contact through the 
internet, I am Mrs Alince  from Philippines, widow to the late former 
minister of finance in Philippine who died on 15th of May 2004. I 
inherited a total sum of $21.5 Million American dollars from my late 
husband, the money was concealed in a metallic trunk box and was 
deposited with a security company in Abidjan Cote D' Ivoire, in 
secretly  safe keeping in the trunk box that was because I needed a 
maximum security/safety of my consignment and no body know about it 
even the government organization can  naver trace  where about of the 
money until I am ready and prepare to claim it. but the Secuerity 
company didn't know the real content of the box, because it was 
deposited as a family valuables.

My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found 
you and perhaps trustworthy to give you this priority of shipping the 
trunk box to any address that you think is very secure and save in your 
country for onward lodgement in your account for the purpose of future 
investment with your percentage of which we shall talk of it. I will 
send you the Authorization Certificate to call them in my next mail 
which is the Certificate of deposit that they gave me on the very day 
when the box of money was deposited under their security company. I 
give thanks immensely for your co-operation as I look forward to hear 
from you for quick conclusion of this transaction.The percentage will 
be your reward for all your moral and financial assistance during the 
period of moving the trunk box to your country.You are therefore 
requested to furnish me through my e-mail address You reply to my 
pravite email ( al_20099@yahoo.fr )

Thanks and I look forward to your urgent message.

Mrs Alice.
