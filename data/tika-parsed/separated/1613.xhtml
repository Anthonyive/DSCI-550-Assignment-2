<body><p>FROM GIDEON KWAMI
BLOCK 18 ROOM 22
REFUGEE CAMP
ACCRA GHANA
MONEY INVOLVED(22,000,000 USD)
ALTERNATIVE-MAIL:(mr_gideonkwami@yahoo.co.uk)

Good Day,
I have a proposal for you-this however is not
mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to
honour against your will. I am Gideon Kwami,24 years
old and the only son of my late parents Mr and Mrs
Kwami.
I got your information in a Proffesional database when
I was searching through internet for a
reliable,honestand trustworthy person to entrust this
business with.I was simply inspired and motivated to
pick your contact from the many names in the list of
the directory after i, go into prayers/fasting.
Well, my father was the rebel leader of the liberian
crisis at ealer last two years before his sudden death
But God knows the truth. My mother died when I was
just 4 years old, and since then my father took me so
special.
Before his death on march 12/2003 he called his
friend who accompanied him to hospital and told him to
call me, on my arrival to the hospital my father told
me that he has the sum of twenty two million Dollars.
(22,000,000 USD) he deposited in his name,in a
security company in Ghana for safekeeping,
And told me where he kept the documents of his secret
funds deposited in Accra - Ghana,the most peaceful
nation in Africa.
And i'm with all the documents which my father used to
deposit the money,and he told me that he disguised the
content to the security as Family Valuable for
security Reason,and he told me that i shold not
disclosed to any body that he have money in the
security company to avoid trace due to his position in
Liberia.
Please i want you to stand as my fathers partnership
to claim this money out from the security company. I
am just 24 years old and a University undergraduate
and really, I don't know what to do.I,contacted you
because I have suffered a lot of set back as a result
of incessant political crisis here in africa.
The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my
life, I am in a sincere desire of your humble
assistance in this regards. Your suggestions and ideas
will be highly regarded.
It's my pleasure to bring to your notice that after my
late father was murdered the liberian government
siezed all my fathers belonging.
Moreso you should understand that due to the tension
that was impossed on me i am curently in Ghana under
the refugee camp to making sure that my life was safe.
Now permit me to ask these few question.
(1)Can you honestly help me as your son?
(2)Can I, completely trust you?
(3)what percentage of the total amount in question
will be good for you after the money is in your
account?
Please, Consider this and get back to me.
With regards.
Gideon Kwami.
