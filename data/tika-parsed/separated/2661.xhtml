FROM THE DESK OF: BARRISTER BRUCE NELSON SMITH.
CHAMBER: BRUCE SMITH &amp; ASSOCIATES
19 KINGSWAY ROAD, IKOYI LAGOS NIGERIA.
Dear Friend
I am Barrister and a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Dr Adams, a 
national of your country, who used to work with CADBURY NIGERIA LIMITED, on 
the 21st of April 2004, my client, his wife and their three children were 
involved in a car accident along Sagamu Lagos Express Road.
Unfortunately they All lost their lives in the event of the accident,
Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my 
clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these 
several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his elatives over the 
Internet to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I 
contacted you. I contacted you to assist in retrieving the money and 
property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposit were lodged.
Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about 
US$10.5M (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United Stated 
dollars).Consequently, the bank issued me a notice to provide the next of 
kin or have the account confiscated. Since I have been unsuccessful in 
locating the relatives for over 2 years now.
I seek your consent to help me in the search of the next of kin of the 
deceased or will you accept the offer to stand as the next of kin Since you 
are from the same country, so that the proceeds of this account valued at 
US$10.5MD can be paid to you and then you and I can share the money. 50% to 
me and 40% to you, while 10% should be for expenses or tax as your 
government may require. I have all necessary legal documents that can be 
used to back up any claim we may make.
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through 
and
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law. Please direct your reply 
through this alternative mailbox if you are interested to enable us discuss 
further.

Yours Faithfully,
Barrister Bruce Nelson Smith (Esq.).


N.B. Please indicate your contact address, telephone, and fax numbers for
