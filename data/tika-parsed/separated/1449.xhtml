<body><p>&gt;From The Desk Of Barrister
Helen Hill (Esq).
Email: { helen_hill99@yahoo.com}

I am Barrister Helen Hill I am an attorney to a
deceased American Immigrant, who was a business man/contractor
in my country with the Crude Oil sector of the
government.Nigeria National Petroluem
Co-opration.{NNPC} Here-in-after shall be referred to
as my client.On the 30th of March 2002, my client, his
wife and their three Children died in the Kenyan
Airways plane crash from U.A.E. Since then I have been
managing his properties, and a contract, which he
executed for the Department of Petroleum Resources
(DPR), Which I monitored the payment as his attorney.

Now the money for the contract has been deposited in a
bank which I would want you to assist in repatriating
before it gets confiscated by the government,
Particularly,the bank has issued me a notice to
provide the next of kin or have the account
confiscated within a short period of time.The deceased
has an account Valued at $28 million dollars (USD).

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the
relatives for over 7 months, now I seek Your consent
to present you as the next of kin of the deceased, so
that the proceeds of this account valued at $28
million dollars can be paid to you and then you, I and
his account officer would share the money. 55% to me
and the accountant, 40% for you, 5% for miscellaneous
expenses that might arise. I have all necessary
information that can be used to back up any Claim we
may make.

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us
to see this deal through.I guarantee that this will be
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will
protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in
touch with me by my E-mail address with your full
names and address,personal telephone and fax numbers
to enable us discuss further about this transaction.

N.B. P:S. your response should be directed to {
} for urgent attention.

Best regards,
Barr. Helen Hill (ESQ).
