Dear,


I am Mr Malick Diop, the director of Contract Awards
and Finance Allocations of the Federal Ministry of Works
and Housing. I presided over the award of the building of
the federal government satellite housing estates at here
in Dakar, the new federal capital city of Senegal.

During the bid for the contract, I had a pact with the
eventual winner of the bid and the contractor of the
project to inflate the contract sum to the tune of US$30
Million Dollars. The contract has since been executed, and
job completion certificate duly awarded. Furthermore, the
payment for the contract has been fully made to the
contractor leaving behind the over-inflated amount of US$30
Million Dollars, which I have secured under contract ref.
No: FMWH/FRN/108X01/2002.

The problem now is that as a senior civil servant, I am
prohibited by the civil service code from running a private
business or foreign bank account. Moreover, I am required
to declare my assets annually with the civil service
commission for verification and clearance, and therefore,
cannot defend this large amount of money as an addition to
my assets without compromising my reputation and the
impeccable records I have achieved over the years.

Therefore, I need your cooperation to be present as a sub-contractor
in the execution of the
project/contract to claim the fund on my behalf.

For volunteering your cooperation in this deal, you are
entitled to 40% of the fund. Should this be acceptable to
you, kindly indicate in writing and confirm the following:

 Telephone and fax numbers for prompt communication.

 Bank name, address and account number where the fund will
 be moved.

Full name of company and address or personal name and
address that will serve as the beneficiary/sub-contractor
to claim the fund.

Furthermore, as soon as this fund is transferred into your
bank account, I will require you to still act as my agent
in investing my share in estates/landed properties and
financial securities in your country.

I want to emphasize here that this deal is free from any
form of risk from both parties as great care has been
exercise in perfecting it, and therefore, I enjoin you to
approach it with an open mind and without any fear
whatsoever. As a deal, I make haste to advise that you
should be private about it.

Kindly channel all correspondences through:
marlick_diop@myway.com

Mr.Malick Diop.
