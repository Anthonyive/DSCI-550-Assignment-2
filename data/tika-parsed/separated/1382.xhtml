Dear ,

I am Mr.Beck Christopher, working with Union Bank of
Switzerland UBS, Warburg Branch, London. I have urgent and
very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6th
1998, an American Oil Consultant Contractor with Mauritius
Mining Corporation MR. JOSEPH BUTTON made a numbered Time
Fixed Deposit for Twelve Calendar months valued at
Twenty-Five Million United States Dollars Only (US$25M) in
my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to
his forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the Island of Mauritius Mining
Corporation that MR. JOSEPH BUTTON died on 11th September
Bomb Blast in America 2001. On further investigation, I
found out that he died without making a WILL and all
attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I
therefore made further investigation and discovered that MR.
JOSEPH BUTTON did not declare any kin or relations in all
his official documents including his Bank Deposit paper work
in my Bank. This Sum of US$25M Is still sitting in my Bank
and the interest is being rolled Over with the principal sum
at the end of each year, no one will ever come forward to
claim it. According to the Island of Mauritius Law, at the
expiration of Five (5) years, the money will be reverted to
the ownership of the Mauritius Government if nobody applies
to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will
like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to
MR.JOSEPH BUTTON so that the fruits of this old man
labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government
officials.

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your
full names and address so that the Attorney can first
arrange from Probate a Letter of Administration, which will
put you in place as the next of kin. Secondly, a bank
account in any part of the World which you will provide will
then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the
beneficiary /next of kin, the money will be paid into your
account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40%
for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paper work for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If
you are interested, please reply immediately via the
private- email address: beckc@she.com
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more
details and relevant documents that will help you understand
the transaction.

Awaiting your urgent.
Thanks and God bless you.

Regards.
Mr.Beck Christopher
UBS Warburg.
