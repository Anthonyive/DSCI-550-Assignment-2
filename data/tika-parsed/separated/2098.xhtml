<body><p>Dear Friend

Compliments of the seasons

This letter is written to you based on contact information I came across on 
web while searching for investment options overseas. My name is *Tony Silver 
and I work as a manager in an Insurance company here.I discovered one 
unclaimed policy for the sum of Twelve Million United States Dollars 
{US$12,000,000.00} to be paid out as SURRENDER VALUE for the LIFE ASSURANCE 
POLICY of one liquidated oil servicing company by name {CEDRY INCORPORATED} 
that went bankrupt nine years ago and does not exist anymore.
For us to claim this money, we need a foreigner who will stand as the 
manager of
the liquidated company to file a claim on this policy using details and 
information I will supply.

I have made efforts over the years to get any foreign member of the 
liquidated company without success. I finally found a lawyer by name 
BARRISTER PRINCE VICTOR who was the lawyer/attorney of the liquidated 
company. I revealed the unclaimed policy to him and he has accepted to work 
with me to get the Surrender value paid to the account of any foreigner I 
will provide to stand as the manager of the liquidated company. Barrister 
Victor told me that the manager then was very sick during their companyï¿½s 
liquidation and later died and for that reason no one raised the issue of 
their Surrender value with our insurance company.

If you accept to stand as the manager or an Assistant manager of the 
liquidated Company to claim this surrender value of Twelve million dollars, 
I am willing to split the funds into three parts, for each of us having an 
equal share of Four Million Dollar. Once you file the claim, we will do the 
rest for you in the inside and get the payment released in your name. If you 
are interested and capable please get back to me through email.

I will send my identifications to you once you indicate your interest to 
work with me. There is no risky in your involved because the company has 
been liquidated and dissolved and has left Africa for about eight years.This 
Barrister Victor and I will come over to your country for our share once 
this transaction is concluded. I am optimistic that we will conclude this 
transaction within three weeks.
Thanks in advance for your anticipated co-operation

Regards
Mr.Tony Silver
