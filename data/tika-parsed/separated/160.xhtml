 DEAR SIR,

 I know that you must have recieved the first letter
 I sent  to you by post, but if you have not, here comes
 afollow-

 upto the letter.  First I must seek for your understanding and pray
 that  Godwill give you the wisdom to understand my problem
 and be  in a position to help as you will be surely blessed
 as you  help. I am Dr Stephen Umah,I am 41 Years old and
 also the  chief accountant with Gulf Bank Nig PLC . I have a
 transaction which I think will be of mutual benefit
 to both  of us. In my desire for a foreign partner with whom
 to do  this ransaction, I stumbled on your contact from a
 business  directory.
 As the head of accounts department of GBNP, I
 discovered  some amount of money while I was auditing accounts
 for the  2001 financial year which has been lying there for
 over 3  years. On further inquiry, I discovered that this
 money  totalling about USD$45.5 Million (Forty five Million
 five  hundred thousand United States Dollars) including
 accumulated interest belonged to one MR. H .LEE , a
 korea  Nationale who lived here and died intestate with no
 beneficiary.
 This man died through a plane crash of ADC airlines
 in  1998. I have Successfully secured the money and with
 the  assistance of my colleague, the money has been moved
 out of  my bank and deposited in a finances company. It was
 packed  in three(3)metal trunk boxes as photographic
 materials. I  would need your particulars to enable me prepare
 documents  which will authenticate that the Consignment belongs
 to you  as the next of kin to MR. H .LEE and to enable you
 claim  the money. I want to be assured of a safe account
 where the  money will be deposited pending my arrival. This
 transaction is absolutely risk free with no illegal
 complications, I have made all necessary
 arrangements for a  successful transaction. Before this money is
 entrusted into  your care, there must be an agreement that will be
 reached  between us stating that:

 1.BOTH PARTIES WILL NOT FOR ANY REASON CHEAT EACH
 OTHER.
 2.BOTH PARTIES WILL WORK TOGETHER TO SEE THIS
 TRANSACTION  THROUGH.
 3.A HIGH DEGREE OF TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY WILL BE
 APPLIED FOR THE SAKE OF OUR WORK.
 4.I AND MY PARTNER WILL STRONGLY BE BY YOUR SIDE
 AS YOU CLAIM THIS FUND AND I AND MY PARTNER WILL
 ARRAGE AN ATTORNEY (LAWYER)WHO WILL WORK ON
 YOUR BEHALF TO GET THE NECESSARY
 PAPERS NEEDED FOR A SMOOTH TRANSACTION.
 5.YOU WILL NOT DISAPPEAR WITH OUR FUND AFTER
 YOU HAVE CLAIMED IT.
 6.DISBURSEMENT RATIO WILL BE 75% FOR ME AND MY
 COLLEAGUE,15% FOR YOU, 5% WILL BE DONATED TO
 CHARITY,WHILE

 5% WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR MUTUALEXPENCES.
 There is need for you to respond to this offer
 immediately  as the government of my country have concluded plans
 to  apply the money into arms procurement to project
 wars and  unrest in African continent.
 I must let you know that a high degree of trust is
 required  and also we will like to use our own share to go
 into any  lucrative business with your help/assistance.
 Awaiting your urgent response now.
 Yours Faithfully

 DR Stephen Umah
