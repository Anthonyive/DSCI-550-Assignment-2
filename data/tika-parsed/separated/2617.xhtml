 From . Mr.Habib Waheed.

Date 29-04-2006.

Kindest Attention:

 

My name is Mr. Habib Waheed. I am from Dubai . I have been diagnosed with 

Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right 

now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I 

have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for 

anyone (not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never 

generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as 

that was the only thing I cared for.

 

But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just 

wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives 

me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different 

way from how I have lived it.

 

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and 

assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close 

friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have 

decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want 

this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.

 

So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was 

well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself 

anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and 

distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United 

States, Asia, Middle East &amp; Europe, they refused and kept the money to 

themselves.

 

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with 

what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the 

huge cash deposit of ten Million United States Dollars ($10, 000, 

000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I 

will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity 

organizations and use it to help those in Need.

 

N/B:Kindly note that 40% of this funds must go to victims of Tsunami, 

Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to other 

Charity Organizations around the World and 5% for your effort and time.

I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am 

using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to 

this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my 

behalf.

 

God be with you.
