<body><p>FROM: JOHN DUF BEN
DAKAR, SENEGAL
AFRICA.
EMAIL:johnduf232002@katamail.com

Dear Beloved One.

    Thank you for giving me your time;Please be patient and read my
email to you, this letter might come as a surprise to you,and you could be
wondering where I got your contact.I got your address through a
personal search on the internet for someone relaible and trustworthy,so i
decided to contact you for an assistant, which I do hope you will take your
time to consider. My name is John Duf Ben, the eldest son of Dr.ENAGUA
BEN, from Zimbabwe.During the current war against the farmers in
Zimbabwe from the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the
white-owned farms for his party members and his followers, he ordered
all white farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and
his followers. My father was one of the biggest farmers in our country
and because he strongly opposed Mugabe's ideas, Mugabe's supporters
invaded my father's farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my
father in the incident and made away with a lot of items in my father's
farm.

Before my father's death,he had made deposite with a Security Company
in Europe, the sum of  US$6.5(Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars).He intended to use the money  in buying new machinery
and to set up a new farm in Swaziland. After the death of my father,l
decided to escape with my other siblings to another country because of
continued harassment and threat from Mugabe and his supporters,we could
only get as far as the republic of SENEGAL where we are now seeking
political refuge.As the eldest man in the Family, i have been making contact
with the company to see how i can make the claim without going there
but to no avail,i was told that the claim can only be made by me or my
father's representative in thier office.This is the reason why i decided
to contact you to assist us since I am not able to travel outside this
country particularly to Europe where the company is located.

I am seeking for your assistance to help us go to the security company
as our father's representative for the claims, For your role in this
transaction,my family and i have agreed to offer you 30% of the total sum
for your assistance, 5% will be set-aside for any expenses that maybe
incurred in the course of this transaction and the remaining 65% will be
for my family and i to invest in any lucrative investment.All I want
you to do is to help me finish this transaction and at the sametime help
me to invest some of our share of the money in a lucrative business in
your country. Please get back to me if you can be of assistance via my
private email address:  johnduf232002@katamail.com  for better discussion
or should incase you have any questions you would like to ask,please
feel free to contact me any time via email.Thanks and God bless as i will
be looking forward to your swift and positive response.Please do not
fail to call on telephone: +221 4488469

Best regards,

MR.John Duf Ben
