<title>MESSAGE FROM MR. ADAMS IBRAHIM.TREAT AS URGENT</title>
</head>
<body><p>Dear Friend,

I feel quite safe dealing with you in this business proposition though, this
medium (Internet) has been greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it 
because it still remains the fastest, surest and most secured medium of 
communication.

I know that this mail will come to you as a surprise as we have never met 
before.My name is Mr ADAMS IBRAHIM  I am the bill and exchange manager in 
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK [A.D.B) I Hoped that you will not expose or betray 
this trust and  confident that i am about to repose on you for the mutual 
benefit of our both families.

I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our Bank who perished along 
with his next of kin with Korean Air Line, flight number 801 with the whole 
passengers on  6th of augustus 1997 and for your perusal you can view this 
site http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen 
interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has 
come to claim his funds of US$8.3M (Eight Million Three Hundred Thoudsand 
United States Dollars) which has been with our branch for a very long
time.

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the Next 
of Kin since nobody is coming for the fund again.The Banking ethics here 
does not allow such money to stay more than eight years, because the money 
will be recalled to the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund after this
period.

In view of this I got your contact through the internet when i was making a 
research on a foreignerthat I will use in this great  opportunity because i 
dont want the money to be recalled to our Bank treasury as uncliamed fund.I 
have also agreed to offer 40% of the total sum and the rest 60% will be for 
me.

The reason for a foreigner in the business is for the fact that the deceased 
man was a foreigner and  it is not authorized by the law guiding our Bank 
for a citizen of BURKINA FASO to make the claim of the fund.So the request 
of you as a foreigner is necessary to apply for the claim and transfer of 
the fund smoothly into your reliable Bank account as the Next Of Kin to the 
deceased.

If you are really sure of your integerity, trustworthy and confidentiality, 
and accept not to cheat or disappoint me after this business, reply with 
your telephone and fax numbers and banking account details where you wish to 
receive the fund.

Upon receipt of the above mentioned informations,indicating your interest in 
the business,I will send you by fax or e-mail a letter of application which 
you will type  and send back to our bank to enable us start this 
transaction.

I will  not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free on 
both sides and dont have any negative impact.You should not entertain any 
fear as all modalities for  the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has 
been finalized, this  transaction will be completed within 10 bank working
day immediately you applied to the Bank as relation to the deceased
customer.

Waiting for your urgent response

           Yours sincerely,

          Mr ADAMS IBRAHIM
