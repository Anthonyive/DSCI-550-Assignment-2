Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put the claim over this fund as the
bonafide next of kin to the deceased;get the required approval and transfer
this money to a foriegn account has been put in place and directives and
needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your
interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this
great business opportunity.Infact i could have done this deal alone but
because of my position in this country as a civiassist(A Banker),we are not
allowed to operate a foriegn account and wouldeventually raise an eye brow
on my side during the great business opportunity.Infact i could have done
this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civiassist(A
Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foriegn account and wouldeventually

secret as i am still in service and intend to retire from service after we

subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated
and further investment,either in your country or any country you advice us
to invest.All other necessary vital information will be sent to you when i
