Dear Sir, 
 
With profound interest and in utmost confidence, I am 
soliciting your immediate assistance or co-operation 
as to enable us round up an opportunity within my 
capability as a result of the death of one of our 
contractor (Beneficiary). 
 
I am Ademola Benson, Chief Auditor, Special Project 
and Foreign Contract Regularization and Disbursement, 
in the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation 
of Federal Republic of Nigeria. We work in hand with 
the Senate Committee on Foreign Contract Payment. Our 
duty is to ensure that all contractors are paid 
their contract sum in due time. 
 
This last payment quarter, a total of 30 contractors 
were short listed for payment and about 25 of them 
have been paid remaining about 5 (Five), information 
reaching this office indicates that one among the 
remaining has been reported dead. His name is Mr. 
Gerrand Schwartz from Sweden, he died in the last Air 
France Concorde plane crash. Meanwhile he finished the 
execution of his contract December 19th 1999. But 
since his death, nobody has come forward to put a 
claim to his contract fund which is about 
US$7,500,000.00 Million (seven Million five hundred 
thousand U.S Dollars) that is why I need your 
immediate assistance to expedite the transfer of the 
contract amount. 
 
With my position as a Director in the Department of 
Contract Regularisation and Disbursement, I will 
regularize all the necessary documents and present 
your company as the bona-fide beneficiary of this fund 
in as much as you respond within 48 hours for 
respect of this important message. Your unreserved 
cooperation in this business is just what we require 
for a successful and hitch - free transaction. 
Necessary measures to ensure a risk - free and fool 
proof transaction and confidentiality has been taken. 
 
Kindly signify your interest by replying via my 
personal e -mail address above. Upon receipt of your 
positive reply we shall discuss on (1) Basic Program 
for Operation (2) Financial Status as to ascertain 
your capability. Upon completion of this transaction 
I have decided to give you 30% of the total sum, 60% 
of the fund which is our share will be used for 
investment in any foreign country of our choice. 
 While 10% has been mapped out to take care 
of any minor expenses incurred. 
Take note that this project will last for only 10 
working days. 
I expect your response in time (within 48 hours) as 
time is of great essence in this transaction. 
 
God Bless and Kind Regards, 
Ademola Benson.
