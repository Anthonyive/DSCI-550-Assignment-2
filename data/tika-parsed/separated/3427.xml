<body><p>Hello Dear,

This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as 
unserious could come into your mind but please consider it a divine wish and 
accept it with a deep sense of humility I am MR ZEID AHMADI , the manager 
incharge of Telex/computing department of  Bank of Africa (B.O.A)Ouagadougou 
Burkina Faso in West Africa, with due respect and Regard,I have decided to 
contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both 
of us at the end of the transaction.

During our investigation and auditing in this Bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customer 
who died on July 30th 2002 of a ghastly motor accident and the fund has been 
dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the fund
in our Custody either from his family or relation before our discovery
to this development.

Although personally, I keep this information secret within I and to enable 
the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of 
execution,the said amount is ($18.5M.,eighteen million,five hundred thousand 
United StatesDollars).as it may interest you to know, I got your
impressive information on my search for a relaible partner,I contacted you 
to be my partner and person to be reliable and capable to champion a 
business of such magnitude without any problem.

Meanwhile all The whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the 
bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval And transfer 
this money to a foreign account has been put in Place and directives and 
needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your 
interest and willingness to assist me and also benefit your self to this 
great business opportunity,In fact I could have done this deal alone but 
because of my position in this country as a civil servant and we are not 
allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually ,raise eye brow on 
my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who 
will forward claims As the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to 
the bank and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to 
be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due Verification 
and clarification by the correspondent branch of The bank where the whole 
money will be remitted from to your Own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk  free,on 
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer, while 65% will be
for me , please you have been advised to keep "Top Secret" as I am still in 
service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with 
you,I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank Until you 
confirm the money in your account,and ask us to come Down to your country 
for subsequent sharing of the fund According to percentages previously 
indicated and further Investment, either in your country or any country you 
advice us to invest in and all other necessary vital information will be 
send to you when I hear from you.

I suggest you get back to me As soon as possible and also include your 
personal phone/mobile And fax numbers for easy communication.
