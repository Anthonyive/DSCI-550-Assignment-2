<body>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, 
 
Would you like to work 
online from Home/Temporarily and get paid weekly? We are glad to offer you for a 
job position at our company,KELLEYKO FABRICS&amp;TEXTILES We need someone to 
work for the company as a Representative/Book keeper in the USA and CANADA. This 
is in view of our not having an office presently in the USA AND CANADA. 

 
Our integrated yarn and fabric manufacturing operations use 
state-of-the-art textile equipment from the world's leading suppliers. Order 
processing,production monitoring and process flow are seamlessly
integrated 
through a company-wide computer network. 
 
* The average monthly 
income is about 4000.00 USD.
* No form of investments from you.
* This job 
takes only 1-3 hours per day 
 
ABOUT THE JOB
We have sales 
representatives all over the world to distribute our products.You know, that 
it's not easy to start a business in a new market (being the US AND CANADA). 
There are hundreds of competitors, close direct contacts between suppliers and 
customers and other difficulties, which impede our sales promotion.We have 
decided to deliver the products upfront, it's very risky but it should push up 
sales on 25 percent.We need to get payments for our products as soon as 
possible. Unfortunately we are unable to open Bank Accounts in the United US 
without first registering the company name.
 
Presently with the 
amount of Orders we have, we cannot put them on hold. For fear of loosing the 
customers out rightly. Secondly we cannot cash these payments from the US soon 
enough, as international Checks take about 14 working days for cash to be made 
available. 
 
We lose about 75,000 USD of net income each month 
because we have money transfer delays. 
 
You are not involved in any 
sales. Once orders are received and sorted, we deliver the product to a customer 
(usually through FEDEX/UPS).The customer receives and checks the products. After 
this has been done the customer has to pay for the products. About 90 percent of 
our customers prefer to pay through Certified Cheque and Money orders based on 
the amount involved. 
 
YOUR TASK ARE:
1. Receive payment from 
Customers
2. Cash Payment at your Bank
3. Deduct 10% which will be your 
percentage/pay on Payment processed
4. Forward balance after deduction of 
percentage/pay to any of the offices you will be instructed to send payment to. 

 
Our payments will be issued out in your name and you can have them 
cashed in your bank or other Cashing Services. Deduct your weekly salary and 
forward the balance to the company via western union money transfer or Money 
Gram. We understand it is an unusual and incredible job position. This job takes 
only 3-7 hours per week. You'll have a lot of free time doing another job, 
you'll get good income and regular job. 
 
This job is very 
challenging and you should understand it. We are looking only for the worker who 
satisfies our requirements and will be  an earnest assistant. We are glad 
to offer this job position to you. If you feel that you are a serious and 
earnest worker and you want to work for KELLEYKO FABRICS&amp;TEXTILES, kindly 
fill the below information and get back to us.
