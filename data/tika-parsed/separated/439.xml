<title>URGENT APPEAL FOR HELP.</title>

<body><p>From: J.Rodney chesson jr 
Chesson Family Corporation, 
Liberia. 
email: chesson_joseph@yahoo.com

Kindest attention, I am very sorry for the informal
manner in which this mail is reaching you. This is
necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable
and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem
strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence
and pray that you take my request very serious.I am
Mr. Joseph Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J.
F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to
1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12
other Liberian Government officials was assassinated
as a result of a military coup that toppled the
government of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. May
his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family
has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia.
You can view our family web page below; 
(http://www.chessonfamily.com/chessonfamilypage.htm)
but please do not call me 
on the tel/fax number below as the number is presumed
bugged by the government.

I received information from a reliable source that
described your country as being economically conducive
for investment and her people as transparent and
trustworthy to engaging business, which made me to
write you. As you may want to know and to make you
less curious, I got your email address from an
Internet site that portrayed you in good light. 
Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the
removal of
President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good
example of a bad leader. The President who needed
support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum
of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$
28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation
for my late father and solicited for my support. I
quickly made an arrangement with a courier company
here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset
management company in 
the uk. I did not support
President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not
for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in
Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my
family under travel watch,confiscated all our
traveling documents and frozen all our account in
Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia
and different peace keeping meetings were held and
President Taylor was advised to step down for national
peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles
Taylor flied into exile but the problem we are having
now is that he handed over power to his Vice-President
Moses Blah who is more wicked and dangerous. He was
the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all
our traveling documents and frozen all our account in
Liberia. That is why I requested for your sincere
assistance pending when a fresh election will be held
here. The main rebel faction Liberians United for
Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) has vowed to
continue its war if Taylor hands over to Blah. The
rebels are not happy with the above development so
they still continued fighting. 

WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:I will transfer the
ownership of the consignment /boxes containing the
cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through
my Lawyer. With these document you will lay claims to
the money as my proxy from the company in europe.

The entire operation is risk free since it is only you
and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the
money after you must have taken the money to your
country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you
in your country to use my share of the money for
investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is
needed to transfer this fund, I propose a commission
of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for
the expected services and assistance. Your private fax
and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy
conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life
now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above
email address is highly needed so as to stop further
contact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to
exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter
extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision
while I await your prompt response. Our phone line
both home and abroad are bugged. So donï¿½t call me. I
will always call you at my convenient time and in a
conducive atmosphere. PLS REPLY TO  chesson_joseph@yahoo.com

Regards,

J.Rodney Chesson. JR.
