<body><p>Hello Dear.
I am writting this letter with due respect and heartful of tears since we have not known or met ourselves previously I am asking for your assistance after I have gone through a profile that speaks good of you.
I want to find out if it's possible for you to deal with individual as to investment .

I would like to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you.
Well I am Mr Cyriel Kelvin from Liberia,the only son of Col, Kelvin Onwun, My father is now late,he died some months back during the last and current crisis in my country(Liberia).
He was one of the high officers in the leadership of formal president Charles Taylor who is now in exile after many innocent soul were killed ,My father was unlucky to be one among those that were killed by the rebel.
The main reason why I am contacting you now is to seek you assistance in the area of my future investment and also for a help hand over some huge amount of money in my possession.
This money (US 8.5 Million) was deposited in a security and finance company in Europe some years ago by my father.
He made me the sole beneficiary.
I am now asking you to stand on my behalf to make this claim and also l want you to stand as my partner oversea and in time of the investment as well.
As I have mention earlier I will make the procedure to this issue to be well known to you if I am given the opportunity to do so.
Pls attach your direct and full information .
Mr Cyriel Kelvin.
