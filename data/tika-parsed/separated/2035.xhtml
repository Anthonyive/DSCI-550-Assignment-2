<title>GOOD  DAY!!!</title>
</head>
<body><p>Greetings!!!

I am Mr Martins  Imaa  Lucas, a member of staff in a Corporate Securities 
firm. We keep valuables for high net worth individuals, blue chip 
corporations and diplomatic organisations.

I am contacting you in regards to our client, the late Chief (Mrs.) Stella 
Obasanjo, who died on Sunday October 23, 2005 in a surgical operation in 
Spain. This client has a total deposit of Thirty Two Million United States 
Dollars in our vaults. After the 9/11 incidents, our company policy do not 
permit cash deposit, so he confided in me as the foreign operations officer 
to make this deposit since June 2004. She did this to avoid traces f the 
money to her since her husband, president Olusegun Obansanjo was against any 
corruption and embezzlement of funds.

The last communication I had with her was on the 25th of August 2005, where 
she was making arrangements to claim the deposit. Thereafter it was revealed 
that she died of a surgical operation in Spain in October.  After the 
acknowledgement of her death, it became apparent that there was no claim to 
her funds since she listed no next of kin in her bio-data form. She made the 
deposit under the name of Guardian Trust investment (GTI) and disclosed the 
content as company valuables and Antiques. This was for confidentiality and 
to reduce taxes.

If no claim is made within six months, the company under its storage terms 
and conditions will legally auction the content of the deposit. If 
discovered that the content is cash, it will be confiscated and I would be 
penalised, since I accepted the cash deposit against the companyï¿½s 
regulations. As a staff, it is impossible for me to have access to the funds 
or claim it myself. More so, such valuable deposits are kept at a different 
branch, where we have our terminal facilities. Consequently, it is important 
that I find a credible candidate to play the role of the Trustee or 
representative of Guardian Trust investment to help claim the deposit.  It 
is on this ground that I need your assistance to claim the funds which will 
be possible with the information I hold. Once this is achieved, you shall be 
entitled to 50% of the total funds while I shall retain the balance 50%.

I am aware of the risks involved in this proposal, therefore I ask that you 
consider the factors above and keep it strictly confidential. However, if 
you feel you are unable to
fulfil this role, I request you discard of this letter.

I look forward to hearing form you.

Thank you.

Mr Martins  Imaa  Lucas
