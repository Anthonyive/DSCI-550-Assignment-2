fortune before his untimely death? Since Then I had made several inquiries 
through your Embassy to locate any of my clients extended relative but this 
Exercise has proved unsuccessful. After several Unsuccessful attempts, 
I decided to trace his relatives Through the Internet, to locate any member of his 
Family not Much progress was recorded My late client was an Influential wealthy businessman, an oil magnet here in Nigeria and he left behind a deposit of Thirty two Million, Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only ($32,200,000.00usd) in his domiciliary bank account in a Commercial bank here in Lagos.

provide his next of kin who should inherit His fortune.
The board of directors of his bank adopted a Resolution and I was mandated 
to provide his next of kin for the payment of this money within 28 working days or Forfeit  the money to the bank as an abandoned property. The Bankers had planned to invoke the  abandoned property decree of 1996 to confiscate the funds after the expiration of the  period given to me.

funds left in his bank account, hence I contact you.
 
I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the Deceased since
you are at an advantage, hailing from the same country, so that the proceeds
