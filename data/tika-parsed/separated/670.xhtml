<body>From: Mrs. Susan Shabangu.



Greetings to you,



With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings,

and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However

strange or surprising this contact might seem to you

as we have not met personally or had any dealings in

the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration

of its importance and the immense benefit it will be

to you.



After careful consideration with my children, we

resolved to contact you for your most needed

assistance in this manner. I duly apologize 

for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not

acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a

person of integrity.



First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly

to you. My name is Mrs. Susan Shabangu, mother of

three and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy 

of The Republic of South Africa for seven years 

running as you will find in the link 

below: http://www.gov.za/gol/gcis_profile.jsp?id=1066 



 

I will now give you a general overview of the

situation. When I was sworn in as Deputy Minister of

Minerals and Energy in 1996, with my influence, my

husband Mr. Ndelebe Simon Shabangu a very successful

businessman was awarded several contracts in my

ministry and had direct dealings with foreign

investors in this field. Due to my political

status, I was not involved in my husbands business

which was very vast and successful. My beloved husband

died whilst on an official trip to Trinidad 

and Tobago in February 2001.



When my husband died, I was contacted as next of kin

by a private security firm in Europe to come forth

with the Certificate of Deposit and claim a safety

deposit my husband has in their Vault in his name. At 

that time, my children and I did not have an idea

where the Certificate might be. We then instructed the

security firm to continue holding the safety deposit

until further instructions from me. Whilst preparing

for the second remembrance of my beloved husband, I

was going through his library collection and to my

astonishment I discovered a Certificate 

of Deposit for the safety deposit with this private

security firm, and other documents relating to the

safety deposit in a book. The safety deposit

which is a trunk, is stocked with hard currency (US

Dollars) totalling $10,000,000 which was generated

from cash payments from his business associates in the

diamond trade from Antwerp, Belgium.



Though I knew my late husband was in the diamond

business, I did not have the knowledge that he moved

funds in cash. This has came as a shock to me and my

children, and we have decided to have this fund

invested immediately in commercial and residential

properties abroad as well as profitable ventures, as

any member of my family cannot hold such a huge

amount in our name due to my political status, hence

we sincerely propose to you to render us your most

needed assistance in this regard.



If you agree to render us your assistance, your role

in this project will be to act on my behalf as a

trustee to receive the safety deposit containing the

funds from the Security firm. Though I believe this

transaction should be based on mutuality, my family's

interest will be protected by a family associate, who

is a lawyer(attorney) attached to the South

African Embassy in the country where the security firm

is located. He is now aware of the safety deposit, and

I have informed him that I am locating one of my

husband's business associates (you) to handle the

funds and invest on our behalf, as he might be opposed

to our decision if he found out 

that I barely know you.



For your reliable assistance, we are offering you 20

% of the funds. I thank you in advance as

we anticipate your assistance in enabling us

achieve this goal. On hearing from you, I will forward

your contact to the gentleman lawyer who will be

representing us, and also give you his

contact for both of you to communicate and proceed

with the transaction. 



He will be working with you for a mutual conclusion of

the process and I look forward to a long lasting

business relationship with you. As you may 

understand, due to my sensitive position in the

present government, it is not safe to communicate with

me via phone or fax. 



This is why I have communicated with you with my

private email address, and I like us to keep this way,

for the safety of this transaction.



whether or not you are interested in assisting us 

please let us know.This will enable us make 

alternative plans, in the event of non-interest

on your part.



With warm regards,

Mrs. S. Shabangu.
