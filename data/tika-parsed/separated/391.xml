family, God almighty will bless and reward you abundantly.
My family and I are true Christians and worship's God truthfully. I got
your contact through Internet during my research on some one who could
help us.

do like any person who can be caring, loving and home oriented. I will
love to have a long-term relationship with you and to know more about
you. I would like to build up a solid foundation with you in time coming
if you can be able to help me in this transaction. Well, my fathers
died earlier seven months ago and left my mother I and my junior brother
behind. He was a king, which our town citizens titled him before his
death. I was a Princess to him and I and my brother are the only people
who can take Care of his wealth now because my mother is not literate
enough to know all my fathers wealth behind. He left up to USD 5, 350,
000.00 dollars (FIVE MILLION, THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND US
DOLLARS,AND ABOUT 100 KG OF ALLUVIA GOLD DUST)with a security company, and I
dont know how and what I will do to invest this money somewhere in
abroad,and process the sale of carat so that my fathers kindred will not take
over what belongs to my father and our family, which they were planning
to do without my presence because I am a female as stated by our
culture in the town. That is why I felt happy when I saw your contact which I
strongly believe that by the grace of God, you will help me secure and
invest this money. I thereby need your help in bringing the box
contaning the money out from the security company, based on your reply I will
furnish you with more details on how we can proceed.
I am ready to pay 10% of the total amount to you if you help us in
securing this money and another 10% interest of Annual Income to you, for
handling this business for us, which you will strongly have absolute
control over. If you can handle this project sincerely and also willing to
assist me in lifting this fund, kindly reach me and I will let you know
the next step to take towards actualizing this transaction as quickly
as possible Please, note that this transaction is 100% risk free.I look
forward hearing from you soonest. Yours sincerely
