<body><p>Dear Sir, 

I am Sam Aluko, former special adviser on Petroleum matters 
to the late 
Head of State of Government of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha. 
Because of my 
strategic position in the former Government and also being a 
close confidant 
of the late Head of State, I was able to acquire personally the 
sum of 
$50,000,000.00 USD ( fifty million United States Dollars only) 
presently 
lodged in a Security Deposit in Europe. I made this money 
largely through 
"CONSULTANCY FEE" and Good Faith Fees" paid by foreign Oil 
companies prior 
to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other 
Lifting/prospecting Right. 
Nigeria is the 6th largest Producer/Exporter of Crude Oil in 
the World. 

As you are probably aware of the fact that Nigeria is prone to 
Military coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability 
has fueled 
hyper Inflation, amongst other problems. I have therefore 
resolved to 
invest my money abroad, preferable in Real Estate Properties 
and Importation 
of Goods from your country for safety and optimum returns on 
Investment. 

However the, present civilian administration of President 
Olusegun Obasanjo 
has placed a restriction of movement on every member of the 
cabinet of the 
past military government. This is as a result of the panel of 
inquiry 
slated to investigate most of the atrocities perpetrated by the 
late former 
head of state. This means that I cannot travel out now till the 
panel 
conclude its investigations which only God knows when that 
would be. 

Straight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present 
two major 
problems one, the tax incidence will be too high, as much as 
60% of this 
money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a result 
of Government 
deliberate restrictions on flight of capital Abroad. However 
arrangement 
have been put in place for you to receive this money from a 
trust worthy 
security Deposit Company in Europe. As soon as you indicate 
your interest. 
I will send to you the security Code number, certificate of 
deposit number 
and airway bill number of the Deposit that will serve as the 
onus of proof 
to enable you claim the Money, which is tagged, Diplomatic 
Luggage. 

All I now need is an honest partner who can receive the money 
on my behalf 
and help me to invest as aforementioned. 
There is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction, as 
the money will 
be delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills. 
If you are interested in assisting me, please send to me by 
email 
immediately your preferred contact address where you can be 
reached at any 
time, upon receipt of the money, you are to lodge this money in 
a bank 
account and contact me for necessary arrangements for the 
investment of the 
funds. For your help and assistance in this deal, you will be 
entitled to 
25% of this money in cash or Equity if you wish to join the 
proposed 
company. 

Finally you are to please urgently send to me through the 
required contact address that include your telephone and fax 
number), so 
that I can instruct the West side Deposit Company to go ahead 
with the 
transfer to you 


Best regards, 
Sam Aluko
