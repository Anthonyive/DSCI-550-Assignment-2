NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS,
LAGOS CONFIDENTIAL.
FROM THE DESK OF:MR JOHN IKE
LAGOS- NIGERIA

Attn;Sir,

        REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided to forward this proposal.
We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum of Thirty
Million United States Dollars (US$30,000,000.00) into his/her account.This
fund resulted from an over-invoced bill from contract awarded by us under
the budget allocation to my ministry and the bill was approved for payment
by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed, commissioned
and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract. we are left
with the balance of US$30,000,000.00 as part of the over-invoiced amount,
which we have deliberately over estimated, for our own

I am contacting you to be our custodian for this fund.

1. 20% for you (Account Owner)
2. 70% for us
3. 10% for Tax, as may required by our Government and yours.

As you may want to know and to make you less curious,I got your address
from adverts, in business directory that protrayed your establishment in
good light. I am the Secretary of the Contract Awarding Committee (CAC)of
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). This transaction is
very much free from all sorts of RISK and TROUBLE from my Government. We
have been exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to most
of us this is a life time opportunity we cannot affford to miss. To get
this fund paid into your account, we have to present a Payment Invoice from
a foreign establishment like yours. With this invoice, we will seek approval
to transfer the fund within 14 banking days through the APEX BANK to your
designatd Bank Account.

I and one of my colleague involved in this deal will come to your country
to arrange for our share upon the confirmation from you that the money has
been credited into your nominated Bank Account. Consequently upon your acceptance
of my proposal,kindly confirm your interest by revert mail to the above
e/mail address It will surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for
this transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be discovered and
business like this cannot be realized without trust. This is why we have
decided to trust you for this transaction. we are looking forward to doing
this transaction with you.

Be further informed that everyone's interest and security had been considered
before you were
contacted. So be rest assured and feel free to go into this transaction
with us. But let honesty be our watch word throughout this transaction and
your prompt reply will be highly appreciated.

Best regards,

MR JOHN IKE,
