<body><p>FROM THE DESK OF DR.ADAMU ALI,
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING MANEGER,
BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A)
OUAGADOUGOU-BURKINA FASO.

Dear Friend,


I am the manager of auditing and accounting at the foreign remittance 
department of BANK OF AFRICA (B.O.A) here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In 
my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$15m dollars (Fifteen  
Million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with 
his entire family in Jully 2000 in a plane crash.For more informations about 
the crash you can visit this site: 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that 
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business 
proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation 
to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is 
coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after seven  years, the money will be transfered into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provision 
of a foriegn account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the 
business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country for 
disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable the 
immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first to the 
bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of application 
that i will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private 
telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location 
where in the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application . I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction 
is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all 
required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me
immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Trusting to hear from you immediately.
Yours Faithfully,
