FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND USD)  FROM THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE  ACCOUNT ABROAD, AFTER WHICH WE WILL TRANSFER THE REMAINING (20M) BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER, I AM ONLY CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER BECAUSE THIS MONEY CAN NOT BE APPROVED TO A LOCAL PERSON HERE, WITHOUT VALID INTERNATIONAL FOREIGN PASSPORT, BUT CAN ONLY BE APPROVED TO ANY FOREIGNER WITH VALID INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT OR DRIVERS LICENSE AND FOREIGN A/C BECAUSE THE MONEY IS IN US DOLLARS AND THE 
FORMER OWNER OF THE A/C MR.RAVINDRA F.

SEND ALSO YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER INCLUDING THE FULL DETAILS OF THE ACCOUNT TO  BE USED FOR THE DEPOSIT.I NEED YOUR FULL CO-OPERATION TO MAKE THIS WORK FINE. BECAUSE THE 
 
MANAGEMENT IS READY TO APPROVE THIS PAYMENT TO ANY FOREIGNER WHO HAS CORRECT INFORMATION OF THIS ACCOUNT, WHICH I WILL GIVE TO YOU, UPON YOUR POSITIVE RESPONSE AND ONCE I AM CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE CAPABLE AND WILL MEET UP WITH INSTRUCTION OF A KEY BANK OFFICIAL WHO IS DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH ME IN THIS BUSINESS.
 
AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS BUSINESS, YOU WILL BE GIVEN 30% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT, 60% WILL BE FOR ME, WHILE 10% WILL BE FOR EXPENSES BOTH PARTIES MIGHT HAVE INCURRED DURING THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERRING.I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR EARLIEST REPLY .
