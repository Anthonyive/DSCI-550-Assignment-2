ATTN:
I It is with hatful of hope i wirte to you in this context below.I am 
Mr.bello dansuki, the director of  first atlantic company in burki-faso west 
africa.I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.
On October 6,2003,an American Consultant/Contractor with kopyket company 
ITD, Mr Robert Noel made a numbered of time Fixed) Deposit for twelve 
calendar months,

valued at $7.5M USD, (SEVEVN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS ONLY), in my branch.Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to 
his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder 
and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the kopyket 
contruction company Corporation that Mr. Robert Noel died from an automobile 
crash.On Further investigation, I found out that he died without making a 
(WILL), and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Robert Noel 
did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,including 
his certificate of Deposit in our company. This sum of ($7.5M USD only), is 
still sitting in our company. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to our rule in this company, at the expiration of 6(six) years, 
the money will revert to the ownership of the serria-leone Government if 
nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will 
like you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Robert Noel sothat the fruits 
of this old man?s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt 
government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately 
your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary 
documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.

We shall employ the serivce of theAttorney for drafting and notarization of 
the (WILL) and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of 
probate/administration in your favour for the release of the deposited fund. 
A Bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide then to 
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. 
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% 
for me and 40% for you.

There is no risk at all as the paper work for this transaction will be done 
by the Attorney and my position as the Director opreation guarantee the 
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please 
reply immediately. I shall then provide you with more details and relevant 
documents that will help you understand the transaction.Please observe 
utmost confidentiality, and be restassured that this transaction would be 
most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to 
invest my share in your country.

waiting for your urgent reply.
Thanks and God Bless.
Yours Faithfully,

opreational director,
Mr.Bello Dansuki.
