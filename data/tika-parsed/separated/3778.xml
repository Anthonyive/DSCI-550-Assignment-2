CAPITEC BANK LTD.
ROODEPOORT BRANCH,
JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA.
Private Email:a_chriss36@yahoo.gr


Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Chris Adriaan credit officer
of Capitec Bank Ltd.I have a concealed business suggestion for you.
Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Mr. Hassian Hussein who was an
Iraqi Business Man and also Deals On Arms With The South African
Government made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a
value of Nineteen million five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only
($19.5m) in my branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to him,
even during the war, again after the war several notifications were sent
and still no response came from him. We later found out that the Mr.
Hassian Hussein and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb
blast that hit their home in Iraq.
After further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Hassian
Hussein did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including
the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last
time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my
bank. So, Nineteen million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is
still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What
bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the
expiration three years the funds will revert to the ownership of the South
African Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Hassian Hussein so that you
will be able to receive his funds.
WHAT IS TO BE DONE:
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall
come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the
necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Hassian
Hussein, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide
me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commence his
job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill
in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter
of probate/Administration in your favor for the movement of the funds to
an account that will be provided by you.
There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a
legalized method and the Attorney will prepare all the necessary
documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters
concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your
nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for
you and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation.
Should you be interested please send me your private phone and fax numbers
for easy communication, you can write me via my private box and i will
provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to
this letter will be appreciated. Kindly send your reply to:
a_chriss36@yahoo.gr

Kind Regards,

Mr. Chris Adriaan.
