<title>Inquiry From David Bryan</title>
</head>
<body><p>


Good day,

    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you
concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our
banks management three years ago.

I am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is
informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain
facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the
subject matter; came to our bank to engage in business discussions with
our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial
portfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us
turn over (invest) on his behalf.

In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to
make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He
directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I
informed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have
this done and in order not to circumvent due process.

Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the
incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available
to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I
followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds
deposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist
private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and
blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake
transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly
private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and
well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was
deposited with the security firm.

The deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his
arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we
had, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and
we got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of
that particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.
I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal
investigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,
information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A
person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in
Canne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the
body and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no
next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us
means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a
name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.
This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful; weï¿½ve used our
private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the
problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with
your details as a possible relative of the deceased.

What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want
you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world
who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The
world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those
that occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should
have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.
There is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I
alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one
unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this
deposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.

My proposal: I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to
the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you
the beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 (Six Million United states
Dollar); I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security
Firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon
receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 60/40.I would
have gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would
have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the
deposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the
consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this
project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be
vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete
this message and forget I ever contacted you.

 I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I
will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you
contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you
contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through
the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I
do not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are
not secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level
of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please
observe this instruction religiously.

Do not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private
email: davbryan00@sify.com

I await your response.

David Bryan
