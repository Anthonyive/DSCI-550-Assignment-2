<body><p>Dear Friend ,

Greetings to you, I am Barrister Chuks Anthony.A a senior advocate
and the legal adviser attached to the former Liberian
President Charles Taylor who is currently on exile/asylum  in Calabar,
Nigeria. Mr. Charles Taylor has been well known to me  for
some time now, the former head of state General Abdul Salami Abubakar
first introduced him to me as a good friend some time in 1998 and I have
since known him to be a very straight forward and
generous person. Hence my involvement in securing his asylum to Nigeria.
For this great gesture His excellency has given me the mandate to help
in transferring some funds, which he had lodged in one of his secret
security companies
as Authorities in some western countries have already frozen his
personal accounts worth billions of dollars before his anticipated ouster. I
am giving you this privileged details after I have given it serious
thought and have come to a conclusion that you are capable of handling
such a transaction and trusting that you will not let me down by exposing
this very generous offer to anyone, considering it's delicate nature.
Trying to secure a capable and honest person for this transfer has been
quite a burden considering the prevalent cases of financial fraudulent
acts being perpetrated by some criminal minds within this African
region. The total sum of $25,000,000.00(Twenty five million dollars)
was lodged in a security company by his excellencies aids on his behalf
and he nor any of his aids cannot directly claim this funds for obvious
reasons which is why I appeal for your assistance in transferring this
huge some for his use as you would be rewarded generously.
I for one am a civil servant and for that not allowed to operate a
foreign account. I am soliciting your help as you are a foreigner and have
no connections with my client and therefore in a perfect position to
lay claim of this funds and subsequently keep a percentage for your
troubles and transfer the rest to a secure account that will be provided
once you are in receipt of the funds. I can assure you that my client has
gone through the trouble of making sure that
this transaction will be carried out in the most secure way to keep it
top secret and hitch free.
This is a proposal and I would like to know your stance first before I
can furnish you with other relevant details, as this transaction will
require definite and precise steps. If you are interested in carrying
out this transaction please get back to me via this e-mail .
 with these details:
(1) Full name or company name
(2) Secure phone number, fax line for quicker
correspondence.
Please treat this with utmost secrecy and urgency, as my client is a
man of principle who keeps to his word and likes his business handled
with some sense of commitment.Anticipating your quickest response.

Yours truly,
BAR.Chuks Anthony
