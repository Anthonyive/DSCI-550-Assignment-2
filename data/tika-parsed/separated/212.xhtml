<title>URGENT HELP NEEDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</title>

<body><p>My Dear,
It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek your co-operation and
assistance in the context stated
below:May I first introduce my self: I am DR.(MRS.) MARIAM
ABACHA,the wife of Late General Sani Abacha (former
Military head of state and President of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria) who died suddenly on 8th June
1998. I got your contact through the help of my sister-inlaw that works
with the Canadian Chambers of Commerce and Tourrism,due,I did not disclose
to her my humble intention for a honest foreigner who will help save my
life and my children. Having noted the confidence reposed on your person by
the sponsor of the recommendation, I became convinced of your capability
and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of US$20 Million secretly
willed in my favour by the late general (my husband).
This money was kept in a Security Company in Amsterdam Holland and I have
all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a Security Vault for
safe keeping.This money has been defaced for Security reasons and also to
avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.We have been deliberating on
how to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a
conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for
non-speculative investments in your country.However,the current civilian
administration of retired General Olusegun Obasanjo(The President of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria) is
seeking vengeance on the Abacha family because of the life prison jail
sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office. In pursuit of
this vendetta,the present Government have resolved to freeze all known
assets of General Sani Abacha including properties at home and abroad and
are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband
in Switzerland,UK and Australia. In fact, the attack on our family (The
Abacha's) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling
passport,family accounts and even trying some members of our family in
court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband..My first son
Mohammed Abacha who was arrested and incacerated for the past 3years was
just reliese from prison on the agreement to refund $1.5 Billion to the
Federal Government of Nigeria allegedly stollen by my late Husband.We are
not ready to comply to this as most of the family assets and bank accounts
abroad have been Freezen by the Obasanjo regime.
In view of this grevious threat to our Economic and personal survival,our
family trustee have secretly protected the will,The Security Company has
called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the
demurrage it is incurring and I told them we would come and claim it very
soon but they seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas
amount, hence the reason why I have chosen you and hope that you will come
to my full assistance and unlimited
co-operation.In the meantime,there is a travelling embargo on us(the whole
family members) and our local accounts are seized. We are currently living
on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the
sins of my late husband. In view of this plight, I expect you to be
trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me
and my children from a hopeless future. And if you agree to help, we will
compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25% of
the total amount of $20 Million US Dollars.
In that case, when the money ($20 Million) is moved into your
discrete account, you will be allowed to withdraw 25% in
your favour,while 10% has been set aside for any expenses you might incure
(There are demurrage to pay before the fund is sign and claimed by
you.)during the process of securing this fund.
The remaining 65% will be invested meaningfully for my children's future.
My cousin (KADIRI MOHAMMED) has perfected arrangements with the Trust
Company concerned and has been assured 100% risk free and safe
operation.What I demand from you now is to arrange to visit the Finance
Company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide
owner.
And in due course, all contacts must be made through
DR.KADIRI MOHAMMED through his Telephone: 234-8033333606
E-mail address: kadiri_hammed@zwallet.com or kadiri_hammed2@zwallet.com
I look forward to your quick response while thanking
you for your co-operation. In view of all above
details, I request you to keep this letter and
co-operation highly confidential.
Best wishes,
DR.(MRS). MARIAM ABACHA.
ABACHAS LODGE,KANO.
