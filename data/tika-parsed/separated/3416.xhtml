<title>IT IS WELL WITH YOU.</title>
</head>
<body>--
Dear Beloved in Christ,

Please bear with me for sending
you this just in case you are offended by it as I know we don\'t know each
other.It\'s my belief that I am doing the lord\'s bidding and what is truly
right in his eyes and that is what gives me the courage to send this email
to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I will need to warn you that
this email might contain the most shocking and unbelievable piece of news
you have ever had in your entire life, but I trust the lord to give you
enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in my heart.


It is
by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth; I had no
choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for eternal
life and in the sight of man for witness of God &amp; His Mercies and glory
upon my life.


I am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert
White, my husband was an expatriate Contractor with Chevron/Texaco in Kenya
for twenty years before he died in the year 2003. We were married for ten
years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for
only four days. Before his death we both got born-again and dedicated
Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside
my matrimonial home which the Bible is strongly against. When my late
husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$7.5 Million (Seven Million Five
Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in a 4 year one-time fixed deposit account
with a Bank in Europe . Presently, this money(with accrued interest) is
still with the Bank and the management just wrote me as the next of
Kin/beneficiary to the account that it has become DORMANT since no
transaction has been operated on it since the completion of the 4 years and
if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not re-activate the account; the
funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a letter of authorization to
somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my condition(note that you
need to activate this account) as I can not come over. Presently, I\'m in a
hospital in Kenya (I chose to remain here since I will die closer to nature
and the lord) where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer.
I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have
only a few weeks to live. It is my last wish to see this money distributed
to charity organizations anywhere in the World that might be in need of it.
I have already donated most of our wealth here in Kenya to our local church
and our house after my death to an orphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all
totalling almost 800,000 USD. Because relatives and friends have plundered
so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of
entrusting futher this responsibility to any one of them any more.



I feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the
good lord or you are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read
this, open your heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your
life. Why would a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you
this and be offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO
IDEA except, that I know that the lord\'s way are not our ways. I have come
to conclude that\'s it\'s divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just
by his breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the
beauty of his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will
become very clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same
time you are chosen for this, you other than someone else. It\'s all part of
the big picture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will
spend forever............


Please, I beg you in the name of God to
help me Stand-in as the beneficiary and collect the Funds from the Bank. I
want a person that is God-fearing who will use this money to fund churches,
orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the
house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is
the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don’t have any child
that will inherit this money and my husbands’ relatives are not Christians
and I don’t want my husbands’ hard earned money to be misused by
unbelievers. I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an
ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not
afraid of death since I know where I am going to. I know that I am going to
be in the bosom of the Lord. {Exodus14 VS14} says that the lord will fight
my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not communicate with you by phone
in this regard because of my soundless voice and presence of my husbands’
relatives around me always. I don’t want them to know about this development
as I know all they are interested in is my husband\'s wealth and not my
health.


With God all things are possible. 

Your Sister in
Christ,
Mrs. Sandra
White.
