Dear sir,
 
I am Dr.Mbeki Ngumeni, a native of Cape town in South
Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South
Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources.
First and foremost, I apologize for using this medium to
reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council(SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.
 
Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-one Million, Five Hundred Thousand US.Dollars ($21,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.
 
This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the total
contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor,
leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit
by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any
foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the Ministry of Justice here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges
of the former contractor to you. I have the authority
of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of
the sum will be 25% of the $21.5 million, 70% for us
and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The
business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided
you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.
Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to
the successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me.
 
Endeavor to contact me immediately through my e- mail
to confirm whether or not you
are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will
enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry
out this deal.
 
 
I want to assure you that my partners and myself are
in a position to make the payment of this claim
possible provided you can give us a very strong
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured
and please, remember to treat this matter very
confidential , because we will not comprehend with any
form of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service .Once again, remember that time is of great
essence in this transaction. I wait in anticipation of
your fullest co-operation.
You can contact me through this e-mail address:- mbengu@37.com
Lastly,please try to send me your telephone and fax number so     that we candiscuss in details.
 
Yours faithfully,
Dr.Mbeki Ngumeni.
