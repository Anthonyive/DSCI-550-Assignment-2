Hello,

It may come to you as a surprise hearing from me, but to be precise I
got your data from the your e-mail site member directory in my search
for a competent business manager/hard working person who is willing and able to be my friend and partner, to liaise with me in order to 
execute a project which I am convinced that you are capable and trusted to do this business with me.

I am Mark Luke, 32 years old and good looking man, and I am from River
State of Nigeria. I have B.SC in Public Administration and I work with
GLOBAL SECURITY &amp; FINANCE LTD. I have now developed the interest in having a business investment outside Nigeria without my employers
knowing about it. Hence I contacted you for friendship and business
relationship.

The fund in question proposed for this project is US$14.8million
(Fourteen Million, Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars Only), which I will
like you to receive on my behalf and to invest it in your business or in
any business that you think will be profitable in your country.

Please Note: This fund came as a result of a multi-national company that
we helped to secure an oil drilling contract some years ago. Because of
our interest, the contract was over-invoiced to the above mentioned
amount and after the contract, the company received their actual
contract sum and went back to their country leaving behind this
over-inflated sum for me and my colleagues to claim.

Now the time has come for me to process and move the fund out for
investment, but I can not do it on my own since I am still working with
the Global Security &amp; Finanace Ltd. This is why I need your help so that
I can use you or your company to process the release of the fund as if 
you are reciving a payment of an executed contract.

Please let me know about yourself/company and also let me know if you
can be able to receive the money on my behalf and invest it in your
company or any good and profitable business in your country without
exposing me, so that we can commence with the process of transfer. 
All you need to send immediately is your FULL NAMES or COMPANY NAME and your TELEPHONE/FAX NUMBERS

Your share will be 40% for your assistance, while I will take 55% and 5% will take care of any expenses that will be incurred in the cause of
transfer.

Please write back if only you know you are capable enough to execute
this project with me. Please this transaction requires utmost
confidentiality. My alternative Private email address is:
            markluke@bareed.com

Looking forward to your cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
Mark Luke
