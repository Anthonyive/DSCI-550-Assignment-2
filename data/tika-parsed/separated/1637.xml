<body><p>Hello my dear,

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. I am Director of Procurement Department at the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, here in the United Arab Emirates.  I obtained your email while searching for a reliable person, who could assist me in receiving transfer of a supposed contract awarded funds.  This fund came as a result of over estimated contract awarded sums executed by foreign contractors in the Petroleum Ministry. This fund has been approved for payment to the contractor by the concerned Ministry. The contracts had been executed and commissioned. What I am about to receive now, is the over estimated funds which the contractor whom I helped during the process of obtaining the contracts added to his estimation for my own interest.  This is a normal deal that goes in my Ministry by top officials.

On our part, all modalities has been worked out in ensuring a smooth conclusion of the transfer to your account within the next few days.  All I want from you is to receive this funds on my behalf, because as Government Official I cannot collect the funds directly from the contractor, neither I am allowed by Law to operate/ run foreign bank accounts. If you are trustworthy and can assist me in receiving the fund, do not hesitate to respond back to me immediately.

Please note that there is no risk involved in receiving the funds in your account for and it will be done through wire transfer. I wish you to state in percentage what you shall have for the use of your account.  As soon as you indicate your interest, further details and the amount involved shall be given to you once I hear from you.  Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.

Looking forward to hearing from you soonest.

Best regards,

Engr. Abbah Nasser.
Ministry of Petroleum and Ministry Resources.
United Arab Emirates.
Greetings To You,

I am the Head of International banking department, in one of the biggest bank here in South Africa. During the course of our auditing, I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1996 and since 1998 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is late and by name Mr. Awal H. Zyed, a citizen of Iraq.  During my investigation concerning his where about, I discovered that he died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) in one of his trips to his country Iraq during Saddam Hussein regime, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans.  I also found out that that Mr. El-Mohammedâ€™s family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL

The total amount involve is Eighteen million Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only
[$18,600,000.00] and I wish to transfer this money into a safe foreigners bank account overseas. But I don't know any foreigner; I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local person here, but to a foreigner who has information about the account, which I shall give to you upon your positive response. I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently.

I need your strong assurance that you will never let us down, me and a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate Arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place. I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries and foreign exchange
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the total amount, 70% will be for us. Further details await your earliest reply.  PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.
