<body>Hello,

My name is Mrs.Jennifer Wilson I am a dying woman who had decided to donate what I have to you. I am 59 years old and was diagnosed for 
cancer about 2 years ago,immediately after the death of my husband, who had left me everything he worked for.I have been touched by God to donate from what I have inherited from 
my late husband to the you for the good work of God,rather than allow my relatives to use my husband's hard earned funds ungodly.I  have asked God to forgive me all my sins and i believe he has 
because He is a merciful God. I will be going in for an operation,and i pray that i survive the operation. I have decided to WILL/donate the sum of $1,500,000(One million five 
hundred thousand dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and to help the motherless,less privileged and also for the assistance 
of the widows.At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls, due to the fact that my relatives are around me and i have been restricted by my 
doctor from taking telephone calls because i deserve all thee rest i can get.Presently,I have informed my lawyer about my decision in 
WILLING this fund to you.I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless you abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good work to 
others. Kindly Contact my lawyer through this email address &gt;(<a shape="rect" href="http://mail.yahoo.com/config/login?/ym/Compose?To=brownwalter03@yahoo.com)if">brownwalter03@yahoo.com)if</a> you are interested in carrying out this 
task,so that he can arrange the release of the funds ($1,500,000.00) to you.My lawyer's name is Brown Walter.

I know I have never met you but my mind tells me to do this,and i  hope you act sincerely.
NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter 
until the task is accomplished,as I don't want anything that will 
Jeopardize my last

wish, due to the fact that i do not want relatives or family members 
standing in the way of my last wish.
love,
Jennifer Wilson
