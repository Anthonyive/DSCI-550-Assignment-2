            PLEASE I REQUEST FOR YOUR GENUINE ASSISTANCE

I want to first solicit your confidence in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. We
shall be counting on your ability and reliability to prosecute a
transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business transaction
requiring maximum confidence. 

We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who
are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds which
are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to commence this business we
solicit our assistance to enable us RECEIVE the said trapped funds ABROAD. 

The source of this fund is as follows : During the regime of our late
head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha,the government Officials set up companies 
and awarded themselves contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in
various Ministries. The NEW CIVILIAN Government set up a Contract Review
Panel (C.R.P) and we have identified a lot of inflated contract funds
which are presently floating in the Bank. 

However, due to our position as civil servants and members of this
panel,we cannot acquire this money in our names.

I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of 
the panel to look for an Overseas partner INTO whose ACCOUNT the sum of
US$15,600,000.00(Fifteen Million Six Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars) WILL BE PAID BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER. Hence we are writing you
this letter. 

We have agreed to share the money thus: 

70% for us (the officials)

20% for the FOREIGN PARTNER (you) 

10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses. 


It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation
business.Please note that this transaction is 100% safe in all it's
ramifications and we hope that the funds arrive your account in latest
ten (10) banking days from the date of reciept of the following
information by email: A suitable name and bank account into which the
funds can be paid. Your confidential telephone and fax numbers for essay
communication. 

The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job
description respectively. This way we will use your company's name to
apply for payments and re-award the contract in your name/company name.We 
are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your
confidentiality in this transaction. 

For security reasons and in order to move forward quickly,please respond
to me by Tel:234 1 776 0870,Internet Fax:1 309 216 0222,so I can bring
you into the complete picture of this pending project and provide more
information as to the succcessful conclusion of this project. The best
response however,would be by telephone, so we can discuss fully all
issues needed to complete this venture in good time,and successfully.

Thank you and God bless. 

Yours Faithfully
Dr. Israel Junaid
