<body><p>Hello,
I am, Mr John Bwaya a consultant to Mr.Roy Presscott, a canadian
citizen, who lived here in Nigeria.
On the 4th of August 2002, he was involved in a car accident along
Kubwa - Markurdi Highway. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost=


there lives as they are on a weekend outing to a nearby city.
I contacted you based on trust to assist me in repatriating his money
and property he left behind, before they get confiscated or declared
unserviceable by the Security Company where his huge deposit was lodged.

Particularly, the deceased has an Amount of $12.6 million dollars,
after my written notification about the death of the deceased to the
security Company they have issued me a notice to provide the next of
kin or
have the Funds confiscated within the next 60 days.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives all this
while, that's why I seek your consent to assert you as the next of kin
of
the deceased, so that the proceeds of this Amount valued at $12.6
million
dollars can be paid to you as the bonafide approved Next of Kin by the
security Company.
If you agree the money will be shared in a ratio of 75% for me while 20%=

for you and 5% will set aside for any expenses incured during the transfe=
r
process.
I have all necessary documents to
to back up the facts and claim on the Fund Release.
All I require is your honest, co-operation and Sincerity to enable us
seeing that this funds is paid to you.
I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any breach of the law.
please if you are willing to assist me in this transaction,please do send=

to me the following,
full names and address
telephone and fax numbers so that i will contact you and notify you on
the next steps towards the actualization of this transaction.
Awaiting your urgent
response.
