<body><p>ATTN.

My name is Mr Green Millat a member of Independent Committee of Eminent
Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibility of
sourcing for bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss
indigenes, which has been dormant since World War II.
It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Bankerï¿½s
Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by
non-Swiss citizens, who were victims of holocaust.

These accounts had been dormant since the end of World War II (May 9, 1945).

The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons
(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant accounts
-54,000 in December 1999. The published lists contain all types of dormant
accounts, like interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts,
safe deposit boxes, custody accounts, Numbered accounts and
non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.

The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims on
accounts due to non-Swiss Citizens. I discovered a dormant account of Mr.
Clement Adene, with a credit balance of 45,000,000 million US dollar plus
accumulated interest.
The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust era, leaving no "WILL"
and no possible records to trace any of his close family members or
relations.


The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all unclaimed
funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existing credit
balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by the law
for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died interstate
living no wills.

Being a top executive member at ICEP, I have all secret details and
necessary contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds
will be banked in the London, being a safe place for funds and we can
share the funds and use in investment of our choice.

Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim
the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your details
for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim documents
for transfer of the funds to you.

Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I will
pay all required fees to ensure that these fund is transferred to a
secure, numbered account in your name in the London, of which you will be
capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to your country
and other banks of your choice in the world.
My share will be 70 percent and your share is 30 per cent of the total
amount.

THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED.

You can find additional information about unclaimed funds through the
internet at the following websites:

www.avotaynu.com

The Holocaust Claims Processing Office has put funds in Escrow awaiting
submission of valid claims for necessary disbursement, I find myself
privileged to have this information and this may be a great opportunity
for a life time of success without risks.

Due to security reasons, reply to me via email only. You may reply to me
securely on the following email, green7@mail2world.com

Thank you for your prompt response.

Mr Green Millat
