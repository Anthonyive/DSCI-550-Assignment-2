I give you this trust as God will be in between us and you will benefit more than expected if you did not think other wise.. This can be transfered hand to hand through security company we operate with, i am hundred percent sure of that, and they will take care of the goods till it get to your hand safely. Although the secourity company did not know what is inside as we locked the money and gold inside a safe box and deposited as family treasure. There is no risky involve or distorbance easy transfer. My aim is to invest in a profitable business in your country.
