<body><p>Dear Friend,

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I 
believe it is only a day that people meet and become great 
friends and business partners.

I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate 
affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I 
write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I 
can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to 
you.

I have an urgent and very confidential business 
proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign 
Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM 
CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) 
for 36 calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 
(Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in 
my bank and I happen to be his account officer before I 
was moved to my present position recently.

  Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as 
well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the 
maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his 
forwarding address but the letter was returned 
undelivered.

After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it 
was again returned and finally I discovered from his 
contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. 
Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand 
of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of 
his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of 
leaking information to the Americans. On further 
investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasserï¿½s family 
wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was 
the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or 
relation in all his official documents, including his Bank 
Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any
WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and 
placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank 
management since no one have heard from the owner since 
2003.

  I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have 
made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am 
the only one that have the information.
With the recent change of government in my country and 
with their efforts to support the United Nations in 
checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of this 
year, the government will pass a new financial control law 
which will give the government authority to interrogate 
account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the 
source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism 
support. If I do not move this money out of the country 
immediately, by end of the year the government will 
definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot 
provide the account owner to explain the source of the 
money. I cannot directly transfer out this money without 
the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting 
you for an assistance.

  As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser, coupled with 
my present position and status in the bank as Head of 
Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the 
release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the 
next of kin to the account, with the correct information 
concerning the account, which I shall give you. All 
documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully 
worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the 
transaction will be executed under a legitimate 
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, 
beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.

If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you 
wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both 
parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact 
me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over 
the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless 
you.

Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send 
you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser 
when the deposit was made for your perusal.
I wait your urgent reply through my private emailaddress:

Regards,
Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.
