Good day to you.

I am Ahmed Ali the director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section
of Bank of Africa Benin in West Africa,and also a special account officer
of  Mr. Abel Faiza Bahar, a  Lebanese.He was a Seasoned Contractor with
Benin Cement Company in Benin Republic., who unfortunately died in the
plane crash of Union Transport Africaines Flight Boeing 727  in Cotonou,
Benin republic on the december 26,2003.

You will read more stories about the crash on visiting this website:
www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/

Before his death on the 26th December 2003, Mr. Abel Faiza Bahar has a
fixed deposit account with the bank and no other person knows about this
account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me that his supposed next of kin died along
with him in the crash. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate
any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to  contact you. I
contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client
before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank.

Consequently, Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives 
for over 5 weeks now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of
kin  of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at
US$10.8 million can be paid to you and then you and me can share the
money. 80% to me and 20% to you.I have all necessary legal documents that
can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest
co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this
will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from
any breach of the law. All documents of transaction will be destroyed
immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.

If this proposal is acceptable to you, kindly email your following
information to me:

a.Complete names
b.Private telephone number
c.Private fax number
d.Private email

Until you write,have a nice day and God bless. You can also contact me via
another email:ah_ali_benin@yahoo.com

Sincerely,Ahmed Ali.
