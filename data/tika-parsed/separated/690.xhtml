<body><p>Compliments...
  I am MRS. MARIAM ABACHA, the widow of the late GEN. SANI
 ABACHA former Nigerian military Head of state who died
 mysteriously as a result of Cardiac Arrest. Since after
my husba
 and ?death my family is under restriction of movement and
that
 not withstanding. We are being molested. Policed and our
Bank
 Account both here and abroad are being frozen by the
Nigerian
 Civilian Government. Furthermore, my elder son is in
detention
 by the Nigerian Civilian interrogation about my husband?s
asset
 and some vital documents. Following the recent discovery
of my
 husband?s Bank Account by the Nigerian Government with
Swiss
 bank in which the huge sum US$700 Million and D M 450
Million
 Dollars was deposited, this is the reason I have decided
to move
 the sum of US$25 Million Dollars which was secretly
sealed in
 two metal Boxes for security reason. I therefore
personally,
 appeal to you seriously and religiously for urgent
assistance to
 move this money into your country where I believe it will
be
&gt; safe since I cannot leave the country due to the
restriction of
&gt; movement imposed on the members of my family by the
Nigerian
&gt; Government. You can contact me through my family lawyer/
&gt; Attorney on his e-mail eugenemartins@blazemail.com
&gt; and my lawyer shall arrange with you for a face
&gt;
&gt; to face meeting outside Nigeria in order to
&gt; liaise with you toward effective completion of this
&gt; transactions. However, arrangement have been put in place
to
 move this money out of the country either Europe or
Africa in a
 secret vault through a security company here in Nigeria.
who
 have affiliate offices in Europe and Africa and as soon
as you
 indicate your interest my Lawyer shall send you the
Deposit
 Certificate of the Luggage and other related documents so
that
 you can help to claim the Luggage. Conclusively, we have
agreed
 to offer you 20% of the total sum 70% is to be held on
trust by
 you until we can decide on a suitable business investment
in
 your company and 10% for all incidental expenses
.Subsequent to
 our free movement by the Nigerian Government. Please
reply
 urgently and treat with absolute confidentiality and
sincerity
 through the above E-mail address. You should note that
even if
 you are not interested you should not let out this
proposal to
 anybody whatever. You should urgently get across to my
Attorney
 so that he can give you the necessary advice on the
procedure
 and requirements for this transaction.
  Best Regards,
  HAJIA MARIAM ABACHA (MRS.)
