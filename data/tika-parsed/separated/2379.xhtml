THE NEED TO INVOLVE A REALIABLE AND HONEST PERSON TO TRANSFER OUT U.S.$5,400,000.00 FROM MY EMPLOYERS(TRUST BOND BANK IVORY COAST)HAS MADE ME TO SEEK YOUR ASSISTANT BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN EITHER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

I AM MR MALICK DIEYE, A STAFF OF TRUST BOND BANK ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST.THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OPENED IN THIS BANK IN 1985 AND SINCE 1998 NOBODY HAS OPERATED ON THIS ACCOUNT AGAIN.AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME OLD FILES IN THE RECORDS I DISCOVERED THAT IF I DO NOT REMIT  THIS MONEY OUT URGENTELY IT WILL BE FORFEITED FOR NOTHING.

THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT WAS MR BERG OLSON WHO DIED SINCE 1998. I AM
ONLY CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER BECAUSE THIS MONEY CAN NOT  BE APPROVED TO ANY LOCAL BANK HERE BUT CAN ONLY BE APPROVED FOR  TRANSFER TO ANY FOREIGN ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE MONEY IS IN U.S DOLLARS AND I WILL NOT LIKE TO LOSE SUCH A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.

MANAGEMENT OF THE BANK IS READY TO APPROVE THIS PAYMENT TO ANY FOREIGNER WHO HAS THE CORRECT INFORMATION TO THIS ACCOUNT WHICH I  WILL GIVE TO YOU WHEN YOU ASSURE ME OF YOUR CAPABILITY TO HANDLE SUCH AMOUNT IN STRICT CONFIDENCE AND TRUST,ACCORDING TO MY INSTRUCTIONS AND MY ADIVICE FOR OUR MUTUAL BENEFIT,I NEED YOUR STRONG ASSURANCE AND TRUST.

I WILL APPLY FOR MY RESIGNATION AFTER THE FUNDS HAS BEEN TRANSFERED
INTO YOUR ACCOUNT AS THIS WILL ENABLE ME TO COME TO YOUR COUNTRY AND COLLECT MY SHARE FROM YOU AND INVEST A GOOD PART OF IT IN YOUR COUNTRY ON PROJECTS YOU WILL ADVISE ME AS LUCRATIVE IN YOUR COUNTRY.I WILL USE MY POSITION AND INFLUENCE ON OTHER CO-STAFF TO EFFECT LEGAL APPROVALS AND ONWARD TRANSFER OF THIS MONEY TO YOUR ACCOUNT WITH APPROPRIATE CLEARANCE FROM PROBATE REGISTRY &amp; FOREIGN PAYMENT DEPARTMENT.WITH ASSURANCE THAT THIS MONEY WILL BE INTACT PENDING MY PHYSICAL ARRIVAL IN YOUR COUNTRY FOR THE SHARING AND OTHER INVESTMENT.
