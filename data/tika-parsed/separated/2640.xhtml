<title>This is from Mr Henry Kabore  </title>
</head>
<body><p>Dear friend.
I know that this letter may come to you as a surprise.I got your address 
through a local Business directory on the web.I must apologize for taking 
some of your valuable time to explain a proposal that I believe will be of 
utmost benefit to us.

I am manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of 
African Developement Bank.(A.D.B.) In my department we discovered an 
abandoned sum of NINTEEN MILLION, THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS ($19,300,000.00 ) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer who died along with his entire family in a plane crash .you can 
also confirm this in the website as

Since the bank got information about his death we have been expecting his 
next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the 
fund unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately 
we learnt that all his supposed next of kin died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim and our banking law and 
guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five 
years,such money will be moved into the banking treasurer as unclaimed fund.

The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned by 
the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot 
stand as next of kin. 25% of the total money will be for you as a foreign 
partner while 5% will be set asite to cover any expenses that might be 
incured during the process of transfering the fund to your nominated bank 
account.

If you're willing to handle this deal with me kind get back to me with your 
Private telephone and fax numbers for easy communicationas well as your 
personal picture or a copy of your international passport to enable me know 
whom i'm dealling with.
Meanwhile, i will send to you an  application form which you will fill and 
send  directly to the bank.

Note:I demand the hightest trust from you to keep this business strictly 
confidential for security reasons as you may know that the bank don't know 
that i am the one that contacted you to stand for this claim.
Best regards,
Mr Henry Kabore
