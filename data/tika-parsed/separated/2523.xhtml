<body><p>Dear Friend,

In a brief, I am Mrs Jessica Haword, Wife of late Mr Jackson Haword, a
white farmer, murdered by unknown assailants in the year 2003 in Zimbabwe.

My husband was a great white farmer in Zimbabwe who was brutally murdered
in the land dispute in Zimbabwe by the agents of the ruling government of
President ROBERT MUGABE for his alleged support and sympathy forthe opposition
MDC PARTY led by the minority white farmers. My husband was among the few white
rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the war veterans backed by the
government.Before the death of my husband, he deposit the sum of US$8.5M 
(Eight Million Five hundred thousand United State Dollars) with one of the
Financial Institution, as if he knew the looming danger in ZIMBABWE. We were
married for twelve years and God blessed us with twin?s children.

Presently this money is still with the Financial Institution. Recently, my
Doctor told me that I might not last for the next Eight months due to an
inflammation of my liver. This has led to my being on 24 hours intensive
care,in a private clinic here in Cotonou Rep. of Benin. I am tired of living
like this.

I have decided to donate part of this fund to an individual, group or a
charity organisation that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct
herein while half of the money shall be kept for the betterment of my children.
I want an individual, or a Charity Organisation that will use this fund for
orphanages, widows, and helping land mine victims worldwide.

I took this decision because my husband's relatives are Trouble Makers and
I don't want my husband's efforts to be used for trivialities I do not want a
situation where my husband's sweat will be used in material pursuits.
This is why I am taking this decision.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact name of my
lawyer,telephone number and email address who will issue you a letter of
authority that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund.

Please ensure to contact me with this email:(jessica_haword@sms@.cz) to enable
me direct you to my lawyer.

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for
this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated
herein.

Hope to receive your reply.

Remain blessed.

Your Sister,

Mrs Jessica Haword.
