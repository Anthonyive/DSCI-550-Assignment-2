<body><p>THE DESK OF:
DR OLU MARTINS(PRINCIPAL AUDITOR) NIGERIAN
NATIONAL
PETROLLEUM
CORPORATION
(NNPC) LAGOS, NIGERIA

ATTN: DEAR SIR,

COMPLIMENT OF THE DAY TO YOU. I WISH TO EXTEND THIS
MUTUAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL TO YOU WITH THE HOPE THAT YOU
WILL GLADLY ACCEPT. I AM THE PRINCIPAL AUDITOR OF THE
NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION. A POST I HAVE
HELD FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS. IN THE COURSE OF
DISCHARGING MY DUTY LAST YEAR, I DISCOVERED THAT SOME
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN THE PAST, COMMITTED SOME
IRREGULARITIES IN THE FORM OF OVER-INVOICED CONTRACT
VALUES WHICH EVENTUALLY GO INTO THEIR PRIVATE BANK
ACCOUNTS. WHAT INTEREST ME MOST AND FOR WHICH REASON I
AM WRITING YOU IS THIS PARTICULAR CONTRACT WHICH WAS
AWARDED TO A FOREIGN CONTRACTOR, IT WAS OVER ESTIMATED
BY THE TUNE OF US$ 5M (FIVE MILLION U.S.DOLLARS).
THIS CONTRACT HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND COMMISSIONED
AND THE CONTRACTOR FULLY PAID,BUT THE US $ 5M OVER
ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE CONTRACT IS STILL LYING AT THE
CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBN). BECAUSE OF THE HASTE
WITH WHICH THE LAST GOVERNMENT WAS REMOVED FROM
OFFICE, THESE MEN HAS NO CHANCE TO COLLECT THIS MONEY
BEFORE LEAVING THE OFFICE. BUT AS A RESULT OF UPDATED
PAYMENTS ADVISE AT THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBN),
IT HAS BEEN AWAITING TRANSFER TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. IN
MY REPORT, I RECOMMENDED THAT THIS MONEY SHOULD BE
PAID BUT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE CONTRACTOR SHOULD
BE INFORMED.
MY RECOMMENDATION WAS ACCEPTED AND I HAVE BEEN
GIVEN THE GO-AHEAD ORDER TO GET IN-TOUCH WITH THE
FOREIGN CONTRACTORS, BUT SINCE THE CONTRACTOR HAS BEEN
FULLY PAID FOR THE JOB HEDID, I WANT TO DIVERT THIS
MONEY TO ANOTHER FOREIGN ACCOUNT. HAVING DONE ALL THE
NECESSARY GROUND WORK, THIS MONEY IS IN MY POSSESSION
AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD FOR A TRUST WORTHY PERSON
INTO WHOSE PRIVATE OR COMPANY'S ACCOUNT
THIS MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO. I WISH TO
RETIRE FROM SERVICE AFTER THIS TRANSACTION AND GO IN
TO BUSINESS IN YOUR COUNTRY THROUGH YOU AS MY AGENT.
YOU ARE THEREFORE REQUESTED TO KINDLY ALLOW ME
TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO YOUR ACCOUNT SO THAT I CAN
WITHDRAW THIS MONEY WHEN I WANT TO. UPON THE TRANSFER
OF THIS MONEY, 65% OF THE TOTAL SUM WILL BE FOR ME AND
MY COLLEAGUES WHILE 30% SHALL BE FOR YOU THE ACCOUNT
OWNER AND THE REMAINING
5% SHALL BE SET ASIDE TO REFUND EXPENSES MADE IN THE
COURSE OF THIS TRANSACTION. BE ASSURED
THAT THIS BUSINESS IS RISK-FREE BUT THE KEYWORD IS THE
CONFIDENTIALITY DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE TRANSACTION
AND MY POSITIONIN THE MINISTRY.

KINDLY TREAT AS URGENT AND CONTACT MEIMMEDIATELY
THROUGH MY TEL:234-1-7763021 OR 234-8033333606
YOU WILL BE FULLY DETAILED WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU. YOUR
BANKING PARTICULARS, I.E ACCOUNT NUMBER, TELEX,
BENEFICIARY, AND YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX
NUMBERS ARE VITAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS
TRANSACTION FOR UPDATING AND REMITTANCE PROTOCOL.

BEST REGARDS

DR OLU MARTINS
