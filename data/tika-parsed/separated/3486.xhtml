<body><p>Dear Friend,

I got your e-mail contacts from computerised datas after my extensive search 
via the website for a God-fearing and trust-worthy person to  bestow this 
transaction which is the only hope of our survival into his or her 
hands.When i got your address,I prayed and meditated fervently over it and i 
commited it into the hands of God that you should be the rightful person to 
help us out before I made up my decision to contact you.I am The Manager of 
Auditing Department of Our Bank ,Ouagadougou Burkina Faso.In my department 
we discovered an abandoned  sum of USD$15.m(Fifteen   million  united states 
dollars). In an account that belongs to this our foreign customer who died 
along with his wife and and children in the plane crash.Since we got 
information about his death,
we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money 
because
we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or 
relation to the deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but 
unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died 
alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It 
is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this usiness

proposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to 
the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming 
for it because I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such 
money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into 
the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request of foreigner in this 
transaction is necessary because our late customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner,I agree that 30% of 
this money will be for you as foreigner partner in respect to the provision 
of a foreign account. 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the 
business and 60% would be for me ,

After which I shallvisit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentages indicated.Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this 
fund to you as I have arranged,you will furnished me with a good receiving 
account details where
the money will betransfered,your private tel and fax number for easy 
communication.
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail a text of 
the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance 
manager,for easy execution of the transaction.I will not fail to bring to 
your notice that this transaction is 100% hitch-free on both side. As all 
required arrangement have been made for the transfer and more so all the 
documents backing this claim will be supplied to you after you might have 
applied.Please I would like you you keep this transaction confidential and 
as a top secret as you may wish to know that I am a senior Bank 
official.Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours Sincerely,

Mr. kaburo  musa
