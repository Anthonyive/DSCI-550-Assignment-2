Dear Director/Ceo
                                       CONFIDENTIAL

Please I am KEVIN KAMARA, the only son of late CHIEF VINCENT KONE KAMARA
from Sierra Leone. I got your contact from the Ecowas Infomation Center
in CÃ´te
d'Ivoire. My sources of your contact gave me the courage and confidence
to rely on you. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek
your assistance to transfer our cash of Ten Million Five hundred thousand
United States Dollars($10,5000,000.00) now in the custody of a BANK here
in Abidjan to your privateaccount pending our arrival to your country.

               SOURCE OF THE MONEY

My late father, chief Vincent Kamara, a native of mende district in the
Northern province of Sierra Leone, was the general Manager of Sierra Leone
mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown. According to my father. This money
was the income accrued from mining co-operation's over draft and minor sales.


Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of major Paul
Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost
destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the Civilian
Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My father had already
made arrangement for his family, my mother, my little sister and myself
to be evacuated to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire with our
personal effects .

My father deposited the fund for the safe custody
until after the war when he will join us. During the war in my country,
and following the indiscriminate looting of public and Government properties
by the rebel forces, the sierra Leone mining co-op was one of the targets
looted and destroyed.

My father including other top Government functionaries were attacked and
killed by the rebels in November
2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah. As a result of my father death, and with the news of my uncles involvement
in air crash in January, dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths
caused my mothers
heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in
the hospital After we must have spent a lot of money on her.

Now my 16-year-old sister and myself are alone in this strange country suffering
without any care or help. Without any relation, we are now like refugees
and orphans. Our only hope now is in the fund our father
deposited in the BANK. To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance
in the followings ways. To assist me claim this fund from the BANK as co-beneficiary.


To transfer this money in your name to your country. To make a good arrangement
for a joint business investment on our behalf in your country with you as
the caretaker.To secure a college for my little sister and my self in your
country to further our education.
And to make arrangement for our travel to your country after you have transferred
this fund. Most importantly. The whole documents issued after deposit is
in my custody. For your assistance, I beg to concede 10% of this money to
you for your assistance .

Best regards

KEVIN KAMARA AND SISTER.
