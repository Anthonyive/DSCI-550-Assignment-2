<body><p>Assalam aalaikoom,
I am Abdul Ramatd.I am married to Late Kazeem Abdul
of blessed memory who is an oil explorer in Singapore
and Kuwait for twelve years before he died in the
year2000.We were married for twelve years without a
child.He died after abrief illness that lasted for
only
four days.Before his death we were both devoted
Muslims.Since his death I too have been battling with
both Cancer and fibroid problems. When my late Husband
was alive he deposited the sum of $15.5million
(Fifteen Million, Five Hundred thousand U.S Dollars)
with a Finance Company in oversea.
Recently,my doctor told me that I have only six months
to live due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me
most is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I
decided to donate this fund to either a Muslem
organization or devoted Muslim individual that will
utilize this money the way I am going to instructs
herein.
I want this Muslim organization or individual to use
this money in all sincerity to fund mosques,
orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of
ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views
and belief of the Holy Quran.
The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S
benevolence and this has encourage me to take the bold
step.I took this decision because I don't have any
child that will inherit this money and my husband
relatives are new Christian's converts and I don't
want a situation where this money will be used in an
Unholy manner.Hence the reasons for this bold
decision. I know that after death I will be with ALLAH
the most beneficent and the most merciful.
I don't need any telephone communication in this
regard because of my health, because of the presence
of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't
want them to know about this development. With ALLAH
all things are possible.

As soon as I receive your reply on Email:abdulramat10@yahoo.it &lt;mailto:abdulramat10@yahoo.it&gt; shall give you the contact
information of the Finance Company and the country in
oversea where the money was deposited.
I will also issue a letter of authority to the Finance
Company authorizing them that the said fund Have being
willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be
forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community
where you reside to always pray for me.

My happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims
worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH
must serve him in truth and in fairness. Please always
be prayerful all through your life.Any delay in your
reply will give room in sourcing for a Muslim
organization or a devoted Muslim for this same
purpose. Until I hear from you, my dreams will rest
squarely on your shoulders.
May the Almighty ALLAH continue to guide and protect
you.
Regards,
MRS Abdul Ramat
