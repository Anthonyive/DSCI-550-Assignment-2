<body><p>From: Barrister Philip Ajayi


RE: SOLICITING FOR A BUSINESS VENTURE AND PARTNERSHIP


Before I proceed, I must be grateful to introduce
myself. My name is Barrister Philip Ajayi a lawyer to
the Ex - President Charles Taylor, the president of
liberia . During the rebellion in my client's country,
my client deposited Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars (US$28.5M)  with a
security company in Lome, Togo which was part of the
money meant for his campaign for re-election into
office.


Presently, the fund has long been moved diplomatically
to a Financial Vault Company in Europe where it is
still kept in safe custody.


MY REQUEST
As a result of my client's present situation as a
refugee in Nigeria who cannot have access to own an
account or accounts, I am looking for a trustworthy
individual/ firm by my client's instructions to
receiving the funds and  advicing us in making the
rightful investment as well as to provide
account(s)where the funds will be lodged into. More
also, we are at the interim interested in buying
properties for
residence as my family will be residing there in the
near future.

COMMISSION/REMUNERATION
As regards your commission/remuneration, my client
have decided to offer you 15% of the total sum and
also set aside 5% for all your expenses (i.e telephone
bills, travelling expenses, hotel bills and other
miscellaneous expenses).

I strongly believe that associating with you to embark
on this and other business ventures will derive a huge
success hereafter and it will be a long lasting
business association via my email for further
briefing.

Endeavor to send your full contact details like your
full names, address, telephone and fax numbers. As
soon as I receive the above information, I will let
you have the contact details of the security company
in Europe where funds are deposited to enable you
verify the existance of the security company and the
deposited funds before we proceed on this transaction.


I await your anticipated co-operation.


Yours truly,
Barrister Philip Ajayi
