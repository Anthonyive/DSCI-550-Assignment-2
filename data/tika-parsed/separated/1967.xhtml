<body>Hello,
I am William Wilcox, a private financial consultant
/Account portfolio manager. I happen to have managed a
particular account for a Resident Foreigner, here in
the United Kingdom, who accidentally died Interstate, 
leaving in our care a reasonable amount in a
Domiciliary United States Dollars Account. The
Highly confidential nature of our client and our
Business Confidential disposition on Client to client
Basis did not warrant us to have an easily
identifiable next of Kin to this particular Client. I
have made several enquiries to locate any of my
client_s relatives immediate and extended, this has
proved unsuccessful. Hence, I am contacting you. I
need you to assist in securing the money and property
left behind by my client before they get confiscated
or declared unserviceable by the Finance House here in
the United Kingdom where his deposits were lodged. The
Finance House has issued Government Mandatory
Formality, notice to provide the Next of Kin or have
the account confiscated within the next one month.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his
relatives for over two years and convinced that no one
is coming up and having satisfied the mandatory legal
requirement of Beneficiary/next of kin Notification, I
now seek a Reliable and Trustworthy person,
with your consent and perfect understanding, to
present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that
the proceeds of this account valued at Twenty One
Million, Three Hundred And Twenty Thousand United
States Dollars, interest Inclusive, can be paid into
an account to be provided by you( preferably outside
the United Kingdom Financial Institutions or its
Isles), as the perceived Next Of Kin Legally and
Otherwise.
I have all necessary documents to back up these claims
as Next of Kin on your behalf. All I require is your
honest cooperation and confidence in me, which I
believe that it is not easy, as we have not done
similar transaction before and not by reference. Hence
the reason I choose to call this a Deal, as it will be
based on trust to enable us see this transaction
through. I guarantee that this will be executed under
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from
any breach of the law. I would advise that you give
this a positive consideration and get back to me soon 
I would be very flexible as well as considerate in
percentage share that will be given to you for your
assistance.
Upon receipt of your response l will send to you my
private number so that you can reach me for further
discussion regarding this project. 
Please send mail to my private email for security reasons
