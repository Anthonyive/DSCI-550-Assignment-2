Dear Friend!
 
 
 It is with heart of hope that I write to seek your
 help in the context below. My name is Zuma Seko,
an origin of Liberia but reside in Europe. I got
your contact during a business search into the
 Internet and was inspired to seek your co-operation.
 
 Based on trust and because I reside in Europe, my
 father in-law, Mr. Peter Chingoka, gave me a mandate
 to source for viable business ventures where he can
 invest funds of approximately USD18.4M. He was a
 member of the tournament policy committee
 responsible for planning the ICC CRICKET WORLD CUP,
 which took place in South Africa from 8th Feb. -23rd
 march 2003.
 
 In the course of carrying out his duties as the
 chairman of the above committee, he over-inflated
 the contract sum to the tune of USD$18.4 Million. He
 initially kept this money in a safe deposit Bureau
 in Zimbabwe under a personal identification number
 (PIN) to eradicate trace of the deposit to him.
 Under the administration of President Robert Mugabe,
 civil servants such as my in-law are not in any
 position to amass such amount of money. To eliminate
 this, the democratic government set up a panel of
 inquiry to probe the financial activities of any
 government official that is suspected for
 misappropriation of funds and the mandated decision
 to seize all his assets and face a twenty-one years
 jail term. Based on this law and to avoid
 complications, the funds were later moved through
 the help of his proxy at the deposit bureau to their
 affiliate in Europe where it is kept as a deposit. 
 By virtue of his job as a civil servant, he is
 poorly paid and cannot defend the source of the
 funds if caught. To avoid such, he prefers to be
 anonymous during the execution of this project. This
 is why I am representing him. Please, treat this
 letter as confidential as possible. I have made all
 necessary enquiries to conclude the transaction but
 I do not have the credibility as a foreigner to
 realize it. It is on this premise that your
 assistance is required, to claim and invest the
 funds in a joint venture partnership business on
 behalf of my in-law.
 
 My in-law has agreed to compensate your sincere and
 candid effort in this regard with 20% of the funds
 when finally received in your local bank account, 5%
 for any expenses incurred and invest the outstanding
 into a joint venture business partnership that would
 be under your direct management. I have completed
 the legal framework required to appoint you as a
 Trustee to my In-law, so that you can claim and
 invest the funds on his behalf.
 
 I look forward to your response.
 
 Regards,
 
 zuma seko
