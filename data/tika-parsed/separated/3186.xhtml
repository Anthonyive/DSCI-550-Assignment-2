<body><p>DR DANJUMA ALI
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.


Dear Sir,

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department 
of African Development Bank (ADB). I got your address in Burkina faso 
chamber of commerce through yahoo details.
In my departmentn we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 30 m US dollars
(Thirty Millon US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our
foreign customer who died along with his entire family in a concord plane 
crash in the year 2003 in paris that almost took the whole life of the 
pasengeres on board.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash 
leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery 
that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this 
businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or 
relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody 
is coming for it and we don;t want this money to go into the Bank treasury 
as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after three years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin 
in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 40 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 50 % would be for ;me and my 
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for
disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the 
immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to 
the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank 
name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for 
easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be 
remitted .

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Your;s faithfully,

DR DANJUMA ALI

(Bill and exchange manager)

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.

N.B.My intention of writing you through email is because I belive it is very
confidential.
