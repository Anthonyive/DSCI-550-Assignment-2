Dear sir,

I am Sanko Richard the only son of late former Director of finance,  Dr 
Johnson Sanko of Sierra-Leone diamond and mining corporation.

I must confess my agitation is real, and my words is my bond, in this 
proposal.

My late father diverted this money meant for purchase of ammunition, for my 
country, during the peak of disastrous civil war in my country, now he has 
deposited the money with BANK here in Abidjan, where I am residing under 
political Assylum with my younger sister Janeth.

For you to assist me transfer this money in your private bank account, the 
said amount is twenty four million United States dollars. I am compensating 
you with 15% of the total money amount,now all my hope is banked on you and 
I really wants to invest this money in your country, were their is stability
of Government,political and economic welfare.

Honestly I want you to believe that this transaction is real and never a 
joke. My late father Dr johnso n sanko gave me the deposit slip issued to 
him by the Bank on the date of deposit, for you to be clarify because, I do 
not expose my self to anybody I see, I believe that you are able to keep 
this transaction secret for me because this money is the hope of my life,it 
is important.

Please write me immediately after you must have gone through my message fill 
free and make it urgent. That is the reason why I offered you 15% of the 
total money amount, and in case of any other necessary expenses you might 
incure, I am resolving to give you an addition of 5% during this 
transaction.

N.B Try and negotiate for me some profitable blue chip investment 
opportunities which is risky free which I can invest with this money when it 
is transferred to your account, personally I am interested in estate 
management and hotel business, please advise me.

And promise me and my younger sister to be our guardian considering our 
situation and not to betray us.


Please we waiting to hear from you.
thanks and God bless you.
Yours truly,
Richard AND JANET
