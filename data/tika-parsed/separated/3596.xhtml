<body><p>FROM THE DESK OF:MR . RAHA. ALI
dIRECTOR AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT,
BANK OF AFRICA, OUAGA-BURKINA-FASO.

ATTN: Please.

Greetings to you, I am Mr.Raha.Ali. the Account Manager of Late Mr.Morris 
Thompson in Bank of Africa, here in Burkina Faso.However I got your contact 
through the International web directory.I decided to contact you by email 
because I feel that it is more secured and private.

Recently i discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valued 
USD14,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million Dollars only)that belongs to one of our 
late Customer who died in a plane crash.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to Late Mr. Morris Thompson an 
American great industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately 
lost his life in the plane  crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which
crashed on January 31 2000,including his wife and only daughter.

You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I
got during my 
investigation;http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/
andttp://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html

The fund has been dormant in his account With this Bank without any claim of 
the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our 
discovery of this development.

The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for Six 
years, it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill.It is 
only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this 
discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull
out this dormant fund.

In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trusted 
colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to 
Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your 
account as the beneficiary´s next of kin now that the bank is still
expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr. Morris 
Thompson.

In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in 
this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the 
time of transfer since I still work in this bank, this is the actual
reason why I required a second party or fellow who will assist me forward 
claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account 
or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty 
a/c can also serve for this purpose.

On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as 
gratification for your assisting me, and the remaining 60% will be for me.

What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have 
in my possession, all the necessary informations to successfully accomplish 
this operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free.

Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive 
response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your
interest to enable us proceed.
I await your Urgent Response

Regrads,
MR .RAHA. ALI
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)
