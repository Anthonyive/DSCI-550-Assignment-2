<body><p>Good Day,



With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings,
and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will
be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me
since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this
transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a
person of integrity.

My name is Wolny Olkusz, the first son of Paul Olkusz,
of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered
in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict,
I decided to contact you through email, after searching
for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with
Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.

However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The
purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed
assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and
political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President
Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly
affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my
father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.



Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business
foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in
major companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit
the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred
thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This
money was deposited with this Private Security company for
safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the
purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment
of new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent
Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the
murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.

I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from
my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but
when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the
Holland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my
decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security
company from South Africa, has a branch holland and they
have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.

I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part
of the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved
in any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a
genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can
be transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to
understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future
and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is
to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the
security company from their office in Netherlands,
as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa
to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you
representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you.

Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your
assistance, and helping me open an account for the money
to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with
me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.
Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I
have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of
expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
($580,000,00) for Charity donation.

If you prefer to accept the 10ï¿½or assisting with opening an
account,
then 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want
you
maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you
in
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my
direct line which is  31-630-854-650 or via email,
wolny_olkusz@latinmail.com




Sincerely,

Wolny Olkusz.
