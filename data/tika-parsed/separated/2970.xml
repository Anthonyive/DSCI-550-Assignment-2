Dear Friend,
I am Mr. T. Smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB 
Commercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential 
business proposition for you. 
On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit 
for forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, 
(forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we 
discovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami 
on his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further 
investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all 
attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry 
Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official 
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum 
of US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security 
company for safekeeping.
No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, 
at the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the 
ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the 
fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the 
owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk 
boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the 
boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am 
writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I 
cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than 
$1m.
I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security 
company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. 
This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names 
and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents 
which will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.
The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me 
and 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this 
transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the 
successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address 
upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and 
relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this 
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall 
require your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties 
like houses, hotels and doing charity works etc)
Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we 
can have a smooth communication.
Awaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email ( 
ttss7520062006@mixmail.com )
Thanks and regards.
TONY SMITH
