<body><p>Goodday,

    I need your help, i am Sarah Mutete the wife of a
Late minister during the reign of mobutu seseko,
   I came to know you in the course of my search for
   a reliable and God fearing partner and I decide
   to contact you because I believe you are a reputable

  person and I felt you can help us over this
   confidential
    matter. I count on your intergrity and honesty to be
   able
   to handle this business.
&gt;
   My Husband was a minister in Democratic Republic of
 Congo , then Zaire during the reign of Late
    President Mobutu.
  My Husbandr was killed during the rebel attack and
    our house was burnt. We manage to escape to Ghana
   with my son and two of my sisters
    my Husband he deposited US50 MILLION, with a
   security
   company in Europe.The money is kept in a trunk boxes

and was registered as precious substance. Thus there
    nobody that knows that it is money that is in the
    box.


  All the document with which the money was deposited
    is
   with us. I am looking for somebody to that is
     capable
   and willing to travel to any part of Europe to
     family from the security company.

   We need a trust worthy and experience person that
    will

    help us to invest this money in your country and
    take
     us as one family and will also buy a house for us
    over
   there where we can live safely.
   We are expecting to hear from you.Please contact me
     on

     Thanks for your anticipated cooperation.please
    include your telephone number and fax number in
    your reply
    Best Regards,
     Mrs Sarah Mutete
