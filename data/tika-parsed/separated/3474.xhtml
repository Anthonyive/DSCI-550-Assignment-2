<title>BLESSINGS.</title>

<body><p>Dear Beloved in Christ,
 
Please bear with me for sending you this just in case you are offended by it 
as I know we don't know each. It's my belief that I am doing the lord's 
bidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the 
courage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I 
will need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and 
unbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I 
trust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in 
my heart.
 
 
It is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth; I 
had no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for 
eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God &amp; His Mercies and 
glory upon my life.
 
 
I am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an 
expatriate Contractor with Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before 
he died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My 
Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before 
his death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I 
decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the 
Bible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the 
sum of US$7.5 Million (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in 
a 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, 
this money(with accrued interest) is still with the Bank and the management 
just wrote me as the next of Kin/beneficiary to the account that it has 
become DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the 
completion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not 
re-activate the account; the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a 
letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my 
condition(note that you need to activate this account) as I can not come 
over. Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya (I chose to remain here since I 
will die closer to nature and the lord) where I have been undergoing 
treatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my 
doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last 
wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the 
World that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth 
here in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an 
orphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  
Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my 
illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this 
responsibility to any one of them any more. 
 
 
I feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or 
you are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open 
your heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why 
would a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and 
be offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA 
except, that I know that the lord's way are not our ways. I have come to 
conclude that's it's divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by 
his breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty 
of his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become 
very clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you 
are chosen for this, you other than someone else. It's all part of the big 
picture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend 
forever............
 
 
Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary 
and collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who 
will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the 
word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible 
made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this 
decision because I don�t have any child that will inherit this money and my 
husbands� relatives are not Christians and I don�t want my husbands� hard 
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don�t want a situation where 
this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking 
this bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going 
to. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. {Exodus14 VS14} 
says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not 
communicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice 
and presence of my husbands� relatives around me always. I don�t want them 
to know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my 
husband's wealth and not my health.
 
 
With God all things are possible. 
 
Your Sister in Christ,
Mrs. Sandra White.
