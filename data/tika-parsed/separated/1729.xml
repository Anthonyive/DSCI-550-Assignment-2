We discovered an abandoned deposit of Six Million Five hundred thousand United States Dollars (US$ 6.5, 000.000.00). Which belongs to a late customer of the bank who died eight years ago in a plane crash in an island in Iran. The name of the island is, Kish Island located in Iran and it is about 45 minutes to UAE.

I will offer you 20% of the total money while 10% will be used to cover any expenses which we will both incure in the in the cost of securing the abandoned funds and 70% will be for me and my partner in the bank 35% each.
