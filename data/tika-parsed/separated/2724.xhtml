FROM MR ERIC KOSHY.
Email/erickoshy11@yahoo.fr

Dearest friend, 

Trust and Confidential Business Proposal.
In order to transfer out (USD 65 MILLION) United States Dollars.I have the 
courage to ask for your assistance to handle this important and confidential 
business believing that you will never let me down either now or in future. 


I am MR. ERIC KOSHY. the AUDITOR GENERAL in one of the prime banks in Benin 
republic. There is some fund left in this bank since 1999 and nobody has 
claimed it. After going through some old files in the records, I discovered 
that if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for 
nothing. The owner of this money is :MR Raymond Beck: a foreigner,and a 
business man by profession and he died since 1999. No other person knows about 
this money or any thing concerning it. The owner has no other beneficiary and 
my investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know anything 
about this money and the amount involved is(USD$65M)SIXTY FIVE million United 
States Dollars. 


I want us to claim and transfer the [USD65M]sixty five million United States 
Dollars from this account into a safe foreigners account abroad , but I don't 
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money 
cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any 
foreign account because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the 
account is Mr Raymond Beck is a foreigner too. I know that this message will 
come to you as a surprise as we dont know our selves before,but be sured that 
it is real and a genuine business. You are the only person that I have 
contacted in this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you 
the next step to take urgently.I would want us to conclude this transfer 
within few working days, In that regards kindly confirm to me your willing to 
receive this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where 
the fund will be safe. I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing 
and other investments as soon as you receive our fund and confirm to me. 


I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign 
account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this 
work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any 
foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to 
you upon your willingness immediately. If you are able and with capability to 
handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions 
and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come 
again in my life. I need truthful person in this business because I don't want 
to make mistake I need your strong assurance and trust.With my position now in 
the office I can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account after 
the proceedures and the necessary banking Mode of transfer, which you can 
provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical 
arrival in your country for sharing. I will destroy all documents of 
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any 
place.You can also come to discuss with me face to face here in Benin republic 
after which I will make this remittance in your presence and two of us will 
fly to your country so at least two days ahead of the money going into the 
account. 


I will apply for annual live to get visa immediately I hear from you that you 
are ready to act and receive this fund in your accountI will use my position 
and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to 
your account. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the 
total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for unforseen expenses both 
parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. 


Please email me at(erickoshy@yahoo.fr) for brief talk before we go into 
business. 
Please keep this business very confidential.
