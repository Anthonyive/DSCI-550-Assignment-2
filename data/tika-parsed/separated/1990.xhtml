Dear Friend,

Greetings to you.

I wish to accost you with a request that would be of immense benefit to both 
of us. Being an executor of wills, it is possible that we may be tempted to 
make fortune out of our client's situations, when we cannot help it, or left 
with no better option. The issue I am presenting to you is a case of my 
client who willed a fortune to his next-of-kin. It was most unfortunate that 
he and his next-of-kin died on the same day the 31st October 1999 in an 
Egyptian airline 990 with other passengers on board. You can confirm this 
from the website below which was published by BBC WORLD NEWS.

WEBSITE.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm.

I am now faced with confusion of who to pass the fortune to.
According to the English law, the fortune is supposed to be bequeathed to 
the government,if nobody comes forward as the next of kin within seven years 
of the demise of the benefactor of the will. My purpose of contacting you is 
to seek your acting as the beneficiary of the will, and lay claim to the 
legacy of $7million, which my deceased client  bequeathed to his 
next-of-kin. For now, I alone know about his will, as my client had great 
confidence in me.

Everything will be left between you and I. The share would be 25% for you 
and 75% for me. I would want to give a huge part of my share to the tsunami 
victims,
as this is my primary objective. All I have to do is amend the will or add a 
codicil to make you the beneficiary to the $7million legacy.

Again, I feel that you may apprehensive and consider this amount too big for 
you to defend. It does not matter, as there are documents to back it up.
This is a legacy being passed on to a next-of-kin. As I am not very sure of 
getting your consent on the issue I prefer not to divulge my full identity 
so as not to risk being disbarred. The English Bar considers it a breach of 
the oath of the English Bar. I need not emphasize to you that the 
sensitivity of this issue need not be toyed with by neglecting its 
confidentiality. I therefore appeal to you not discuss this request with 
anybody, even if you decline my request.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours truly

Stephen Ayling.
