<title>PRAISE ALLAH, THE MOST BENEVOLENT</title>

<body><p>FROM : MRS ASHIA HASSAN

 PRAISE ALLAH, THE MOST BENEVOLENT

I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Late
herina bana of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in
Sudan for nine years before he died in the year 2002. We were
married for eleven years without a child.He died after a brief
illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were
both very devoted muslims.

Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and
fibroid problems.When my late husband was alive he deposited
the sum of $20 Million (Twenty  Million U.S. Dollars) with an
oversea private security and holding firm .

Presently, this money is still with the private security and
holding firm in Malaysia ,Asia. Recently, my Doctor told me that
I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem.
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my

 condition I decided to donate this fund to either a moslem organisation or
devoted muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to
 instruct here- in. I want this muslim organisation or individual to use this
 money in all sincererity to fund mosques, orphanages,widows and also propagating
the word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of

the holy Quran.

The holy Quran emphasized so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encouraged
me to take this bold step. I took this decision because I don・t have any child


that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are new Christians
 converts and I don・t want my husband・s hard earned money to be misused
 by people I call unbelievers.

I don・t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I know that after death
I will be with ALLAH the most beneficient and the most merciful. I don・t
need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and
the presence of my
husband・s relatives around me always. I don・t want them to know about
this development.

With ALLAH all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply
I shall give you the contact of the Security Company. I will also
issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original-

beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the Muslim community where
you reside to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life
of a true devoted muslim worthy of emulation. Whoever that wants to
serve the ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness.

Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your
reply will give me room in sourcing For a muslim organisation or a
devoted muslim for this same purpose. Until I hear from you, my dreams
 will rest squarely on your shoulders. May the almighty ALLAH continue
to guide and protect you.
