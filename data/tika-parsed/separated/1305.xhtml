DEAR FRIEND, 

URGENTLY AND EXTREMELY CONFIDENTIAL. 

I am an Accountant and the chairman of the tender committee which 
awards contract in the department of the petroleum Resources of Nigeria 
. I sent you a letter by post office sometime ago informing you of our 
plan to transfer the sum of US$20.5million (Twenty
million, Five hundred thousand US Dollars only) to your account.

 I have been waiting to hear from you,but up till now, nothing has been 
heard from you hence this particular message. In any case, I guess that 
you may not have received the letter after all due to the shortcomings 
of our postal system. I want you to know that this fund originated from 
an Over-invoiced contract sum which was awarded to a foreign firm in 
1999.

 I and my three (3)other colleagues in the tender Board purposely 
inflated the actual cost of the contract to the tune of US$20.5Million. 
However, the original contractor has fully executed the contract, the 
project commissioned and the contractor paid his actual contract worth, 
leaving behind the over-invoiced sum. So, itis based on this that we 
now want you / your company to come forward to claim this sum on our 
behalf. We are Civil Servants, and we are not allowed to operate 
foreign account while still in office, so you are therefore to act as 
one who had executed a contract worth the sum of US$20.5million for my 
Department and you now want your payment.This deal is 100% risk free. 
We 
are perfectly in charged and had worked out modalities that would 
guarantee a hitch free transfer of this fund to your account. 

We have also mapped out 30% of the total sum for you for your help and 
assistance while the remaining is for me and my colleagues. If you are 
interested in the proposal, and you are a trustworthy person who would 
not sit on this money if it is transferred to your account,kindly 
indicate by contacting me through my private telephone/fax numbers,or 
via my E-mail.You can as well send your bank account details for this 
transfer. This deal must be kept absolutely confidential till we 
succeed. 

Thank you as we look forward to your anticipated co-operation. NOTE 
=After a successful transfer, 30% for you, 60% for us, 10% mapped out 
to settle expenses incurred by both parties in the process oftransfer.

We will also visit you immedaitely we conclude this transaction to 
collect and invest our shares of the total sum into any viable business 
you may advise us in your country. Contact me urgently through my email 
address  philipsss@noolhar.com 
 

Best regards 

PAUL P. UCHECHI 

pls call me on my phone number 234-1-7212507 now for more discussion.
