Hello,

It may come to you as a surprise hearing from me, but
to be precise I got your data from the your e-mail
site member directory in my search for a competent
business manager/hard working person who is willing
and able to be my friend and partner, to liaise with
me in order to
execute a project which I am convinced that you are
capable and trusted to do this business with me.

I am Mark Luke, 32 years old and good looking man, and
I am from  River State of Nigeria. I have B.SC in
Public Administration and I work with GLOBAL SECURITY
&amp; FINANCE LTD. I  have now developed the interest in
having a business investment outside Nigeria without
my employers knowing about it. Hence I contacted you
for friendship and business relationship.

The fund in question proposed for this project is
US$14.8million(Fourteen Million, Eight Hundred
Thousand Dollars Only), which I will like you to
receive it on my behalf and to invest it in your
business or in any business that you think will be
profitable in your country.

Please Note: This fund have been under a suspense
account pending the time it will be claimed by the
owner. It came as a result of a multi-natinal company
that we helped to secure an oil drilling contract some
years ago and after the contract, the company got paid
and went back to their country leaving behind this
over-inflated sum for me and my colleagues to claim.

Now the time has come for me to process and move the
fund out for investment, but I can not do it on my own
since I am still working with the Global Security &amp;
Finanace Ltd. This is why I need your help so that I
can use you or your company to process the release of
the fund as if you are reciving a payment of an
executed contract.

Please let me know about yourself/company and also let
me know if you can be able to receive the money on my
behalf and invest it in your company or any good and
profitable business in your country without exposing
me, so as to give you all the details needed to make
the money transferred to you. 

Your share will be 40% for your assistance, while I
will take 55% and 5% will take care of any expenses
that will be incurred in the cause of transfer.

Please write back if only you know you are capable
enough to execute this project with me.

Please this transaction requires utmost
confidentiality. My alternative Private email address
is: markluke2@bareed.com           
  
Looking forward to your cooperation.

Yours faithfully,
Mark Luke
