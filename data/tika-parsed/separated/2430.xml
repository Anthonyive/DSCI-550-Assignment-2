Dear friend, 

I regret any inconvenience I could 
have caused by contacting you with my business proposal.


However,  
this is something that I need the assistance of a foreign partner to 
carry out successfully, hence this communication with you.I would like 
you to  providing advisory assistance and services, you are also going 
to assist in receiving by bank transfer to your account the funds to be 
utilized for the proposed investments.  The total amount involved is 
eighteen million five hundred thousand Dollars (US), which, after we 
reached recessary agreement, shall be transferred through the overseas 
banking agent of Central Bank of my country (The Gambia).
 

The fund 
is presently waiting to be transferred to any foreign beneficiary 
confirmed by us to them as our overseas associate.  Our proposal is 
that after you receive the funds,  you will receive a one-off 
commission of 20% of the total amount transferred.  


The remaining 
80% for me and my partners will be used for various forms of 
legitimateinvestments in your country.  However, this is optional, and 
should it not beconvenient for you to further assist us with investing 
the money, we can end our cooperation after you make available to me 
our 80% of the money.

 
Our proposed venture with you is absolutely 
legitimate, with approval of regulatory authorities in my country,  and 
the money will be transferred to your account with all necessary back-
up documents showing legitimate source/origin of fund. The transfer 
will be effected to your account within seven (7) working day as soon 
as we reach an agreement and you furnish me with a suitable bank 
account for receiving the money.


Please, get back to me asap with 
your confirmation that you are ready to co-operate and work with us as 
outlined above.  Any suggestions which you may have for facilitating 
the transaction successfully from your side are welcome.

regards,

Azeez Cumoo.
