<body><p>&gt;From :Kennedy Bright.

Dear, 

It is a sincere gratitude to acquaint you with this
proposal for the purpose of investment in your
country. 

I know this letter may come to you as a surprise since
we have not met before. I am writing based on the
information I gathered from  the internet concerning
you.

My name is Kennedy Bright, the Son of late Chief 
Bright . Until his death was the director of DIAMOND
Mining field of Kalangba District in SierraLeone.
Before his death in a private hospital in Freetown, he
disclosed to me the reason he was poisoned by his
business associates. He revealed to me that he made a
deposit of US$ 5,500,000 ( Five Million Five hundred
Thousand United States Dollars).The money is deposited
in a Security Company company.in Europe 

He also directed me where he kept the deposit
certificate and agreement reached with the trust and
finance company. He advised that I should leave for
abroad after his death immediately to facilitate the
claiming and transfer of this money to any country of
my choice for proper investment. 

I am now in Abidjan, cote dIâ€™Ivoire since one month as
he has been buried. Besides,I strongly want to
continue my education in your country and you would
stand as my guardian and overseer of investment of
this money. As soon as the money is transfered into
your account , you will be compensated immensely out
of the total sum.

If you are willing to assist me in respect of this
transaction, kindly contact me on my email address
stated above, I will furnish you with more
information.FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME THROUGH THE MAIL
ADDRESS IS SAFE FOR THE TRANSACTION.

Thanks and yours truly,
Kennedy Bright
