<title>HELLO</title>

<body><p>Dear beloved,

My name is Abdul Manoni, A Bahrain national,I have been diagnosed with
Oesophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment,
and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to
medical experts. I have not particularly  lived my life so well,
as I never really cared for anyone(not even myself) but my business.
Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always
hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only
thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there
ismore to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the
world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this
world I wouldlive my life a different way from how I have lived it.
Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property
and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a
few close friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul
so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want
this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have
Distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia
and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do
this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of
my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity
organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be
contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no
one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Eighteen Million
dollars($18,000,000,00) that I have with a finance House
abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and despatch it
to charity organizations.

N/B:KINDLY NOTE THAT 20% of this funds must go to the tsunami
victims and another 10% for your effort and time.

Regards.

Abdul Manoni
