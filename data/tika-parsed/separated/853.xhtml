<body><p>                     MR WILLIAM DRALLO
                     BANQUE TOGOLAISE DE
                     DEVELOPPEMENT.
                     LOME-TOGO

I AM THE MANAGER BILL AND EXCHANGE OF THE FOREIGN
REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF BANQUE TOGOLAISE DE
DEVELOPPEMENT.

I am writing you, following the impressive information
about your profile through the website. Therefore, I
believed that you shall posess the capability and
reliability to champion this opportunity with me.

In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of 14
million US dollars (Fourteen million US dollars), in
an account that belongs to one of our foreign
customers who died along with his entire family in
December,2002 in a plane crash. Since we got the urgly
information about his death, we have been expecting
his next of Kin to come over and claim his money
because we can not release it unless somebody applies
for it as next of Kin or relation to the deceased as
indicated in our banking and financial policies but
unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin
or relation died along side with him in the accident
leaving no body behind to claim the money.It is
therefore upon this discovery that I and other
officials in my department now decided to make
this business proposal to you and release the money to
you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is
coming for it and we donï¿½t want this money to go into
the Bank treasury as unclaimed bills. The Banking law
and guideline here stipulates that if such money
remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be
transferred  into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer
was a foreigner and an indigene cannot stand as next
of kin to the deceased family.

We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as
foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a
foreign account, 5% will be set aside for expenses
incurred during this transaction and 75 % would be for
me and my colleagues. Thereafter, I and my colleagues
will visit your country for disbursement according to
the percentages indicated.

To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you
as arranged above, you must apply first to the Bank as
the relation or next of kin to the deceased indicating
your private telephone and fax numbers for easy and
effective communication and location where
the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax
or e-mail the text of the application. I will not fail
to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch
free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for
the transfer.

You should contact me on my E-MAIL as soon as you
receive this letter. I decided to contact you as we
have products of interest in your part of the world
where we can invest our own percentage to avoid
peoples awareness as we are civil servants. With your
acceptance and cooperation, we can conclude this
operation within ten working days. Please keep this
very confidential.

May God be with you.

Yours faithfully,

William Drallo.
