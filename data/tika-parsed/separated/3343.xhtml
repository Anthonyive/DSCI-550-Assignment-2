<body><p>Greetings

TRANSFER OF US$18,000,000.00(EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS) INTO YOUR ACCOUNT

I am Mr. Charles Brown, a Canadian attorney 
based in Manchester, United Kingdom and the personal attorney to Late 
Mr. Mark Michelle, a French National. Late Mr. Mark Michelle until his 
untimely death was a private oil consultant/contractor with the Shell 
Petroleum Development Company In Saudi Arabia, hereinafter shall be 
referred to as my client.
 
On 21st April 2000, my client and his wife 
with their three children were involved in a ghastly auto crash; all 
occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then, I 
have made several 
enquiries with his countryâ€™s' embassies to locate 
any of my clients extended relatives.  After several unsuccessful 
attempts, I decided to personally contact you with this business 
partnership proposal.
 
 The deceased had a deposit valued presently at 
Eighteen Million United states dollars and the company has issued me a 
notice to provide his next of kin or beneficiary. Having been 
unsuccessful in locating any of my late client relatives for over two 
(2) years now. I am now seeking your consent to present you as the next 
of kin/beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account 
can be paid to you.
 
 I have worked out modalities for achieving my 
aim of appointing a next of kin as well as transferring the money 
abroad for us to share in the ratio of 50% for me and 35% for you, and 
we shall collectively donate 10% to the Tsunami relief course while 5% 
will be set aside for any incurable expenses both local and 
international.
 
The money transfer paperwork itself will include a 
certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does not ask 
questions. Also the paperwork will include proper certificate that the 
fund being transferred is from non-criminal sources. In short this will 
be a proper and legal money transfer with no risk involved. The 
transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any problem. All I need is 
your trust and confidence. Provide me with these information:
 1. Your 
contact phone and fax numbers.
 2. Location address
 
As soon as I hear 
from you, I shall provide you with further clarification that you may 
need to know.
 
Faithfully yours,
 
Mr. Charles Brown
