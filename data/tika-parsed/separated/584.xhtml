<body><p>
Dear Sir, </p>





<p>I am DR KABO HAMMED</p>





<p>I have urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American oil
consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered
time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months,
valued at US$41,500,000.00 (Forty-one Million, five
hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity,
I sent a routine notification to his forwarding
address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a
reminder and finally we discovered from his contract 
employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident 
with his family along Benin/Shagamu Express Way. On 
further investigation, I found out that he did not 
leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin 
were fruitless. </p>





<p>I therefore made further investigation and discovered 
that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin n
all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit
paperwork. This sum of US$41,500,000.00 is still
sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled
over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
No one will come forward to claim it. 
According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5
(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim
the funds. </p>





<p>Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry
Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will
not get into the hands of some corrupt officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide me
immediately with your full names and address so that
the attorney will prepare the necessary documents 
and affidavits, which will put you in place as the
next of kin.
 
We shall employ the services of two attorneys for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A
bank account in any part of the world, which you
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. </p>





<p>There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via
email. Upon your response, I shall then provide you
with more details and relevant documents that will
help you Understand. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable
for both of us because I shall require your assistance
to invest my share in your country. </p>





<p>Awaiting your urgent reply via <a shape="rect" href="mailto:email:dr_kabortsb@yahoo.com">email:dr_kabortsb@yahoo.com</a></p>





<p>Thanks and regards
