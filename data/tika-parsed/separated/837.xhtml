 FROM:MRS.MCKNIGHT LUCY,

THE WIFE OF LATE CHIEF FREDRICK MCKNIGHT,

FORMER POPULAR BLACK FARMER IN ZIMBABWE.


Dear Friend.

With due respect, trust and humility I write this
Letter to you seeking your help and assistance though
It�s difficult since we have not met before. 

I got your good contact from the Zimbabwean
Information Exchange(ZIE) regarding your business
profile and Sincerity, I believe that you are capable
and reliable in assisting this my urgent request. I am
Mrs. BUSISIWE LUCY MCKNIGHT, the wife of LATE FREDRICK
MCKNIGHT, the former popular black farmer in Zimbabwe
who is also a Famous politician, in the Zimbabwe
political arena. My husband was assonated by president
Mugabe and his men because he (my husband)refusal to
agree with the so called president to take the lands/farms 
of the whites who contribute to make the country what it is today.
Because of my husbands sincerity he was constantly briefing the press 
on what is going wrong in the country and the autocratic government of
Mugabe.He was assassinated on 23 November 2001 being Sunday by 8.45 in Harare, 
in Western  province of Zimbabwe, the planners of the assassination are well
know by the masses. 

My dear when this incident occurred at about 8.45 in Zimbabwe time, my husband 
did not die on the spotrather he was rushed to Harare hospital where he later died. 
Before the death of my husband, he had taken me and our son to South Africa to 
deposit the sum of US$32.5 million {Thirty two million five hundred thousand dollars} in a
security company . And now I am in Zimbabwe but my son is in South Africa 
with the money deposited in asecurity company with the documents intact. Because of
the country existing law, which bears asylum seekers/refugee like him 
(my son) and also hisage not to operate an account that exceed US$2000.00
and the fear of the South African government not raising  eyebrows about the
money therein South Africa, I decided to write to you seek for your help 
for this money tobe transferred into your private bank account as all
arrangements for a hitch free transfer have been fully taken care off.
And also due to my presentcondition here in Zimbabwe, Mugabe and his allied have
deride me the right of traveling outside the country, I am having a deadly 
cancer ofthe breast which make me to be worried to see that
this money is in a safe hand before anything happened to me, it is the 
only thing left for the upbringing of my children whom are still young before my
husband left me. I want to assure you also that this 
transaction is 100% risk free as no other person knows this 
apart from my first Son Samuel and I. Dear, as for your rewarding kind 
assistance I have resolved to give you 20% of the total amount, while 5% have 
been mapped out for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this
transaction. We planned to invest the rest of the money in your country under 
your guidance.If you are willing to assist us try as much as possible to write 
me so I also inform my son about my negotiations with you.

Dear, bear in mind that our lives and future of my
children depend on this fund and we do hope that this
money will be safe, when finally transferred into your account. I do hope of 
establishing a rewarding and good relationship with you and your
family after this transaction. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible. 
Please I would likeyou to keep this transaction highly confidential and secret 
considering my son�s position in South Africa. I have already brief my son 
immediately you,if  you  receive this mail kindly contact him.

This is his phone number +27-835266638,I am waiting to
hear from you soon.



Thanks for your understanding and God bless you.

Best regards,

MRS. LUCY MCKNIGHT.
