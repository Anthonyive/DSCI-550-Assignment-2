Dear Sir/Madam

RE: TRANSFER OF (USD 30, MILLION)

  I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance 
department of BANK OF AFRICA.

  I am writting to seek your coperation over this business deal. In 
my 
department, I discovered an abandoned sumof$30.millionUSD
(THIRTYmillion US )dollars)only , in an account that belongs to one of 
our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in a plane 
crash that took place in Kenya,East Africa,the Late DR. GEORGE BRUMLEY,
a citizen of Atlanta,United States of America, contractor with ECOWAS,
(ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES) .

  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting 
his 
next of kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be 
released unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to 
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately , 
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon 
this discovery that I now decided to make this businness proposal to 
you and release the money to you via your foreign bank account as the 
next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent 
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money Could go into 
the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

   The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money 
remained unclamed after four years, the money will be transfered into 
the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for your assistance and 
maximum co-operation as a foreign citizen to stand as the next of kinin 
this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was 
a foreigner and a Senegaleise cannot stand as next of kin to a 
foreigner. 40 % of this money will be for you as my foreign partner, 
inrespect to the provision of a foreign account. 10 %will be set aside 
for expences incured during the business and 50 % would be for me.There 
after I will come over to your country for disbursement accoding to the 
percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of 
this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the bank as the 
relation or next of kin to the deceased,indicating your claims and 
wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will 
send to you by fax or email the text of application which you will fill 
and submit to the office of the foreign remittance director of the bank 
of africa. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is stricly confidential and i will use my position in this 
Bank to effect a hitch free transfer of the fund. You should contact me 
immediately as soon as you receive this letter.

Trusting to hear from you immediately.

 

Your’s faithfully,
Dr. Jerry Montteiro 
Bill AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICA.
