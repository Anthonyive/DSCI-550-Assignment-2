Attention,
Thank you for giving me your time, I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc. here in Hong Kong attached in Private Banking Services, I amcontacting you concerning a customer and an investment placed under our banksmanagement; as a matter of fact it was 3 years ago. In 2004, the subjectmatter; Ref: FI/TSB/958/042/0500 came to our bank to engage inbusiness discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 14.37 million United
 StatesDollars, I was the officer assigned to his case;  In line with instructions,the money was deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around February 25th 2004. I made
 futile efforts to locate him I immediately  Four days later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead, a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France. it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. There isUSD$13,991,674(Thirteen million, nine hundred and ninety one thousand, six hundred and seventy four united states dollars) deposited, I alone have thedeposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless Iinstruct them to do so. My proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction is given to the finance firm to officially release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation/associate,and all etiquette shall be done in accordance with the rule of law, Iwillsimply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the proceeds 50/50. I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit, If you
findyourself interested to work with me,please contact me specifically,through this email account sirqinwang@netscape.net. It is necessarytoinform you thatunder no condition should you contact me via official channels
I await your response.
Yours Sincerely,
Qin Li Wang
