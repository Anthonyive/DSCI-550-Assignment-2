GROUP AUDIT FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 
DIVISION
ALPHA BANK LONDON
66 Cannon Street, London EC4N.
Attn!
RE:
TRANSFER OF £20,000,000.00 MILLION POUNDS TO YOUR
ACCOUNT.
I feel quite 
safe dealing with you in this important business.Though, this medium 
(Internet) has been
greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it 
because it still remains the fastest medium of
communication. However, 
this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be treated 
as
such. At first I will like to assure you that this transaction is 
100% risk and trouble free to both
parties. IN ORDER TO TRANSFER OUT 
(TWENTY MILLION POUNDS STERLINGS)£20,000 000.00 FROM
OUR BANK HERE IN 
LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS 
ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader who was believed to acquire 
the fund through his secret Crude Oil deal with the Former
IRAQI 
Government.The deceased died with all the members of his family in an 
auto-accident in JUNE 23,
1999 without a WILL. The amount involved is 
[£20, 000,000.00 POUNDS STERLINGS].

I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO 
A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER WHOM I CAN 
TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A SURPRISE AS WE 
DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE 
BUSINESS. I CONTACTED YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE 
THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

Let me hear from you, URGENTLY EQUIRY

Regards,
MR.CHAD
