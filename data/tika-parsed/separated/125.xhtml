I am DR. MOSES O. EKWONWA.the Auditor General of prime Banks, during the course of our auditing I Discovered a floating fund in an account opened In the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has Operated on this account again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner of this account is Mr. Allan P.Seaman, a foreigner, and an industrialist, and he died since 1993. And no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other Beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Allan P. Seaman until his death was the manager Diamond Safari [pty]. SA.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
