Attention: Dear friend,
   REQUEST FOR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP OF GREAT PROFITS
I am HON. (DR.)OKON PHILIP, the Director of Procurement and Contract Award at the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/ business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. It is with trust that I wish to contact you on this matter concerning the transfer of US$35Million Dollars.
Sometime ago, a contract was awarded by my Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to an International Oil Firm, to Service, Turn Around Maintenance and Rehabilitation Work on Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company (KRPC) Plant in Nigeria. This contract was over-invoiced by us (myself and two junior colleagues) to the tune of (US$35 Million United State Dollars). Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key Tested
Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide. It is based on this that some officials in my department and I have decided to establish a cordial business relationship with you, hence my contacting you. We want you to present yourself as the Beneficiary to this fund, so that we can release the fund into your account for safety and subsequent disbursement. We have all modalities set.
We have been disappointed some years ago by a British, Mr. Rick Williams whom we trusted with a transaction of this nature up to the tune of US$50Million U.S. Dollars. He is sitting on our money for no apparent reason and refused to give us our share but we believe that for his act of wickedness to us, he will never go unpunished by God. Mr. Rick Williams still resides in London and enjoying our collective money.Because of this we are afraid and we need your total trust and assurance that you must be an honest and straight-forward person.
As, we are willing to try again with you believing in your good
cooperation and Faithfullness.
We have agreed to share the money thus:
1. 30% for the account owner (you).
2. 60% for me and my partners
3. 10% to be used in offsetting taxes and all local &amp; foreign expenses.
Please, note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free and we will commence the transaction from the date of receipt of the following information from you via e-mail.
Please if you accept this proposal, send to me by e-mail.
1. Your  personal telephone and fax numbers.
2. Your Bank name, address, telephone, fax as well as your Bank Account
numbers. Or you open a new account for this business.
With these information, we are going to put in application for the release of this funds (US$35M) into your account for us all. Due to our sensitive position, we can not afford a slip in this transaction so contact me immediately through my e-email address for further information on the requirements and procedure for this transaction. It will only take four working days to conclude this business because once you send the your full name and address with your direct phone and fax number, we shall credit your account through our Reserved Account in Europe or Asia.
Remember that my present situation will not allow me to search for another person, I absolutely HOLD YOU ON TRUST. Therefore we urge you to respond immediately to this my email address to enable me commence with the modalities of this transfer as we are well prepared to do this promising transaction with you and hope to continue with you in future.
Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and utmost urgency.
Yours faithfully,
HON. (DR.)okon philip
