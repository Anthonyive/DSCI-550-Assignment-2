<body><p>Mr.Charles Greene
Senior Audit Officer
Natwest Bank Group
UK.

Dear Friend,

I am Mr.Charles Greene Senior Audit Officer of Natwest Bank Group UK.
Natwest Bank London. I am writing following an opportunity in my office
that will be of immense benefit to both of us.In my department we
discovered an abandoned sum ofÂ£20.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twenty
million five hundred thousand British Pounds) in an account that belongs
to one of our  foreign customers Late Mr.Morris Thompson an American  who
unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight
261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only
daughter.

You shall read more  about the crash on visiting this site.

http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/


Since we got information about  his death, we have been expecting his next
of kin or relatves to come over and claim his money because we cannot
release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only
daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the
knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this
discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to
make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or
beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement
since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into
Government treasury as unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained
after eight years the money will be transferred into banking treasury as
unclaimed funds.

We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while
the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country
for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once
this money gets into your account.Please be honest to me and trust is our
watchword in this transaction.

Note this transaction is confidential and risk free.As soon as you receive
this mail you should contact me by return mail.Please note that all
necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has
been finalised. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your
response.

Please if you are interested in this project contact me for further
directives.

Best regards

Mr.Charles Greene
