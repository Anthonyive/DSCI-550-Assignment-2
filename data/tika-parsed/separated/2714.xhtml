<title>BUSINESS PROPOSAL (ASSISTANCE REQUIRED)</title>
</head>
<body><p>BANK OF AMERICA (ASIA)LTD.
17/F DEVCON HOUSE
979 KING'S ROAD
HONG KONG.

Dear Friend,


I am Joseph Wong, credit officer of Bank of America (Asia) Ltd, Hong Kong.


I  have an urgent and  very confidential business proposition for you.


On october 6, 2001, an American Engineer/Consultant with  the Chinese
Solid  Minerals Corporation,Mr. Steinmetz Horst made a (Fixed) Deposit for
twelve calendar months, valued at US$40,500,000.00 (Forty Million  Five
Hundred thousand United State Dollars only) in my branch.


Upon maturity,I sent a routine  notification to his forwarding address but
got no reply. After a month, we  sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the  Hong Kong Solid Minerals Corporation
that Mr. Steinmetz Horst died from a recurrent heart disease.


On further investigation,I found out that he died  without making  a will,
and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless.


I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  Mr. Steinmetz
Horst did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his  official
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.


This sum of US$40,500,000.00 is still lingering in my Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.


According to the Hong Kong Law,under china's foreign and defense
affairs,at the expiration of 5 (five) years,such funds will revert to the
ownership of the chinese Government for financing military operations,such
as purchasing of arms and ammunitions for the military.


In order to avert this negative development,i will like to seek for your
permission as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Steinmetz
Horst so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not be use for
financing weapons which will further enhance the courses of war in the
world in general.


The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of
60% for me and 30% for you and 10% for Expenses Incurred in the course of
the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork  for this
project will be done by my attorney and with my position as the credit
officer guarantees the successful execution of this project. If you are
interested,please reply immediately.


Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more  details and that
will help you understand the transaction.


You should observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured  that this 
project would be most profitable for both parties because I shall require
your assistance to invest my share in your country.


Awaiting your urgent reply.


Thanks and regards.


Mr. Joseph Wong.
