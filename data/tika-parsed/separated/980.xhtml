<body><p>FROM:MR JOHN DICKSON


 Dear Sir,

 I am MR JOHN DICKSON a Banker in one of the leading
 Commercial Banks here in Nigeria.I contacted you based
 on a mutual busiess transaction that I would want us
 to handle in confidence and hope you can understand
 the need for us to do this and for you to stand in for
 it. One MR STUARK WOLK  and his wife. died in
 a ghastly motor accident while on a business trip on
 the 24th of August 2002.


  The said couple had no children and was about 63years
 old before their death. He never identified
 with anybody as his relative and investigation made
 could not trace any relative to the late couple.

  Before his death, he has the sum of Sixteen Million Five
 Hundred &amp; Forty Five Thousand ,Six &amp; Fifty Two Dollars.
 made from contracts he executed with Oil Companies
 here in Nigeria and the proceeds are with our
 Commercial Bank .

 Few weeks ago, the Bank tried requesting that the next
 of KIN to the deceased should come up to claim his
 fund deposited with our Bank.I am the Manager in
 charge of unclaimed funds hence my contacting you to
 stand in as the next of Kin.

 After much effort hasbeen made ,I decided to contact you
 as to  have you stand in as the next of KIN to claim the
 fund so thatthe bank will not declare the account dormant ,
freeze or confiscate the amount as they stated in the letter
 sent to my Department.

 If you can stand in,I assure you that this is risk
 free as I will advise you on  what to do to have this
 fund moved to your account and we can agree on terms
 of sharing. All you have to do is to conscent to this
 by giving me the go ahead to have you presented to the
 Bank as the next of kin through a lawyer.I will tell
 you how to get a lawyer but it has to be confidential
 who will apply and present you as the next of KIN.

 AS soon as we make application, obtain the necessary
 approval, the money will be paid through here or any
 of the banks payment  centre Overseas.This will take
 us about 10 working days to conclude  depending on how
 you respond to our correspondence. If you are  willing
 to stand in as the next of Kin ,send to me your full
 names ,address,telephone and fax numbers.
 As soon as I get these information requested,I will then
 brief you on the procedure that has to be taken to have this
 transaction concluded within a short period of time.

 Note that we will have to reach an agreement on the
 shearing of the fund as you have to agree to give me
 my own share as soon as you receive the money to your
 account.



 I look forward to hearing from you

MR JOHN DICKSON
