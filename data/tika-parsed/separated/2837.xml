Rivers State of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of 
US 45,000,000.00, which I inherited, from my late father. This funds 
was accumulated from royalties paid to my father as compensation by the 
oil firms located in our area as a result of oil presence on our land 
which hamper agriculture which is our major source of livelihood. 
Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But before his 
he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some funds with a 
security firm and Security Code Number was also revealed to me, he then 
advised me to look for a reliable business partner abroad, who will 
assist me in investing the funds in a lucrative business as a result of 
economic instability in Nigeria. 
I and my family have unanimously 
decided to give you 20% of the total funds, 2% for charity homes and 3% 
for expenses, which may arise during the transaction, fax and phone 
bills inclusive. The balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my 
family. I hereby guarantee you that this is not government funds, it is 
not drug funds and it is not funds√Ç  from arms deal.I will give you all 
proof of deposit and existence of funds once urgedand fully satisfied 
with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the beginning of 
a prosperous relationship between my family and 
your family. 
Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform 
me 
immediately so that I will look for another contact.
