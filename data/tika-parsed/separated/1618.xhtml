<title>INVESTMENT PROPOSAL</title>
</head>
<body>FROM: MR: HENRI MOYO. Email:henrimoyo12@rediffmail.com
 
Good day! My name is MR.HENRI MOYO, eldest son of MR.
CHARLES MOYO of Zimbabwe. This might be a surprise to
you where I got your contact address. I got your
address from South African Information Exchange in
Johannesburg. 
 
During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe
from the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to
claim all the white-owned farms to his party members
and his followers, he ordered all the white-owned
farmers to surrender all their farms to his party
members and his followers. My father was one of the
best farmers in our country and because he did not
support his idea, supporters invaded my father’s farm
and burnt everything in the farm, killing my father
and made away with a lot of items in my father’s farm.
 
 
After the death of my father, my mother and I and my
younger sister decided to move out from Zimbabwe
because our lives were in danger with the money my
father kept in his hidden safe in my mother’s house.
The amount contained in the safe is US$20m (Twenty
million, US dollars) and we decided to move to the
Republic of South Africa where we deposited the money
in a Security Company as valuables. So, I decided to
contact overseas Firm that will assist me to move this
money out of South Africa, because we are asylum
seekers here in South Africa which disqualifies us
from operating an account or getting involved in any
Financial transaction here in South Africa. We have
agreed to give you from the total sum 20% for helping
us to move this money to your country while 80% will
be for me and my family to invest in your country. 
 
If you are interested please kindly furnish me with
Your personal phone and fax numbers for easy
Communication. You can contact me on the above
 Email address, Note that this transaction is 100%
Risk-free and it requires mutual trust and absolute
Confidentiality and I have taken care of all
Formalities regarding it. Your urgent response will be
Highly appreciated in this regard. 
 
Thanks and God bless.
Best regards,
Henri
