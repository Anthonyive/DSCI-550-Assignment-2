LIBERIAN
Dearest Beloved one,
Based on your profile, l am happy to request for your assistance and
also to go into business partnership with you, i believe that you will
not betaryed my trust which i am going to lay on you.
I am Mr Mcuty Udoa,19years old and the only Son of my late parents
MR.and MRS MUSTAPHA UDOA. My father was a highly reputable busnness
magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of LIBERIAN during
his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France
during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2004.Though
his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been
masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.
But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old, and
since then my father took me so special. Before his death on Febuary
12th 2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital
and told him that he has the sum of Ten Million United State
Dollars.(USD$10 000 000) left in a security company in a mettalic trunk
box, but the security company didn't know the content because it was
registered as family valuables personal for security reasons.
I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't
know what to do. This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a
result of incessant political crisis here in LIBERIAN . The death of my
father actually brought sorrow to my life. Sir,I am in a sincere desire
of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas
will be highly regarded. Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
1. Can I completely trust you?
2. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you?
Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
Thank you so much.
My sincere regards,
Mr Macuty Udo
