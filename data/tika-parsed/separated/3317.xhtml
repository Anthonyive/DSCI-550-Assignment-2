FONDAZION DI VITTORIO

Foundation's Officer,
Fondazion Di Vittorio,
ITALY
http://www.fondazionedivittorio.it

Concern.

The Foundazion di Vittorio, would like to notify you that you have been
chosen by the board of trustees as one of the final recipients of a cash
Grant/Donation for your own personal, educational, and business
development. The Fondazione Di Vittorio, established 1977 by the
Multi-Million groups and now supported by the Economic Community for West
African States (ECOWAS), United Nations Organization (UNO) and the
European Union (EU) was conceived with the objective of human growth,
educational, and community development.

To celebrate the 28th anniversary program, The Vittorio Foundation in
conjunction with the Economic Community for West African States (ECOWAS),
United Nations Organization (UNO) and the European Union (EU) is giving
out a yearly donation of US$1,000,000.00, (One Million  United States
Dollars) to 100 lucky recipients. These specific Donations/Grants will be
awarded to 100 lucky international recipients worldwide; in different
categories for their personal business development and enhancement of
their educational plans. At least 15% of the awarded funds should be used
by you to develop a part of your environment. This is a
yearly program, which is a measure of universal development strategy.

The objective is to make a notable change in the standard of living of
people all around the Universe (From America to Europe, Asia to Africa and
all around). The Vittorio Foundation has been assured of highest
organization standard courtesy of the United Nations. It is our belief
that we can achieve a great positive change in the general welfare of the
universe through this program. That is why the foundation is doing
everything possible to get all recipients notified of their donation.

Note that your country is not the only country that is benefiting from
this donation. Beneficiaries have been chosen from countries from all
continents. The idea of this donation is that within ten years from now,
there will be notable richness among many unusual people around the world.
This will give many people the opportunity to get their lives to a stage
where they had always wanted.

Kindly note that you will only be chosen to receive the donation once,
which means that subsequent yearly donation will not get to you again.
Take time and thought in spending the donation wisely on something that
will last you a long time. Recipients are only eligible to be awarded this
donation once.

Based on the random selection exercise of internet websites and millions
of supermarket cash invoices worldwide, you were selected among the lucky
recipients to receive the award sum of $2,500,000.00 (Two Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) as charity donations/aid from the
Vittorio Foundation, ECOWAS, EU and the UNO in accordance with the
enabling act of Parliament. (Note that all beneficiaries email addresses
were selected randomly from over 100,000 internet websites or a shop's
cash invoice around your area in which you might have purchased something
from).

You are required to fill the form below and email it to our Executive
Secretary below for qualification documentation and processing of your
claims. After contacting our office with the requested data, you will be
given your donation pin number, which you will use in collecting the
funds. Please endeavor to quote your Qualification numbers (N-222-6747,
E-900-56) in all discussions.

===========================================
Executive Secretary- Mr. Riccardo Varanini.
Email:  riccardovaranini_09@yahoo.it

All information is strictly confidential and will only be used for the
purpose to which it is been requested.

Please note that these donations/Grants are strictly administered by
Economic community for West African States (ECOWAS), European Union (EU),
under delegated powers from the United Nations Organization (UNO). This
means that your qualification number will be reffled to know the
organisation (ECOWAS or EU) that will handle your payment. You are to keep
this whole information confidential until you have been able to collect
your donation, as there have been many cases of double and unqualified
claim, due to beneficiaries informing third parties about his/her donation.

Finally, all funds should be claimed by their respective beneficiaries, no
later than 15 days after notification. Failure to do so will mean
cancellation of that beneficiary and its donation will then be reserved
for next year?s recipients. On behalf of the Board kindly, accept our
warmest congratulations.

Regards.
Mr. Gianni Mattioli
(Foundation officer)
