<body><p>Goodday,

I am Joseph vaye,the son of late Issac Nuhan Vaye, deputy minister of public

works under President charles taylor of Liberia.

Before the political upheaval in liberia my late father was a good and
close 
friend of president
charles taylor and a member of his inner caucus.But of late when liberia

crisis came up again,with the rebels trying to oust charles taylor out
of 
government and liberia,president charles taylor became very uncomfortable

with some of his loyalists which my late father happened to be one of them

because he had the believe that at the rate at which the rebel group was
 
closing in on him in Monrovia(which is the seat of power)was as a result
of 
the leakage of some vital security information  from his cabinet and he

decided to eliminate some of his cabinet members which my father happened
to 
be a victim.

It started in the name of an uncovered coup and he ordered the arrest of

some of his cabinet ministers
and the Vice President Moses Blah on the 5th of june which my father was

included and some days later we learnt about my father's death alongside

with John Winpoe Yormie, deputy minister of national security.

My mother and i actually knew why my father was murdered because before
the 
political mayhem in
liberia,my late father  and President charles taylor have maintained a
good 
relationship and he has
assisted him in lodging funds from the sales of diamond in different banks

and security companies which my late father also benefited from it until
at 
the wake of rebellious war in liberia my father was not getting along with

President Charles taylor because of his tyranic law which created a breach

in their relationship and with the alarming rate at which the rebels are

advancing into Monrovia to unseat President charles taylor he was no longer

sure of  some of his cabinet members and decided to eliminate
them under the disguise that they were coup plotters

Before the death of my father, at the peak of his relationship with 
president charles taylor,he was able
to accumulate some funds $31,600,000.00 (US$31.6million)which he deposited

with a security company in Ghana from the deals he did for the president.

Basically my mother and i require a trustworthy person that can assist
us to 
retrieve our funds from the
security company in Ghana.Life has been very unstable for us(my mum,my

youngers ones and i) and i would not want to bore you with all we went

through but for the sake of my late fathers death. All the necessary 
documents for the deposit are in my possession I am now a refugee in 
neigbouring african country Ghana due to the fear of been killed by 
president charles taylor and the unrest in Liberia.

Ironically the president of Nigeria  has agreed to grant  president charles

taylor assylum in Nigeria in
order to restore peace in liberia so we are trying to do all  we can at

earnest to retrieve the funds from
the security company and leave West Africa before he eventually comes to

Nigeria.

Upon your response to this mail,i will intimate you on how we can proceed
to 
get the funds from the security company.

Best regards,

Joseph
