 URGENT BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP

 ATTENTION:PRESIDENT/C.E.O

      Dear Sir, My name is MR TUNDA USENI the eldest son of Rtd General
 JEREMAIAH. J. T. USENI who was the est. while Minister of the Federal
 Capital territory Abuja in the late General Sani Abacha\\\'s Regime of
 1993-
 1998. I am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost confidence and
 trust to enable us provide a solution to a money transfer of $60M that is
 presently putting my entire family into great disarray. You may be quite
 surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not despair, I got your
 contact from a business site on the internet and following the
 information I gathered about you, I was convinced that you could be of
 assistance to me. So, decided to contact you at once due to the urgency
 required for us to immediately transfer the said funds out of the
 country. During the time my father was in the government with the late
 General Sani Abacha as the head of state, they were both involved in
 several deals that yielded Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the
 deals was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the importation
 of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the Nigerian Defense, funds set to
 embark on an oversea campaign to counter the United States action to put
 a stop to the self succession bid of the Abacha\\\\\\\'s government to
 retain
 power, and monies set aside to rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum
 Refineries and the National Electric Power Authority which supplies
 Electricity to the entire nation. If you are conversant with world news,
 you would understand better. During this period my father was able to
 make some good money for himself and kept in his private bank accounts.
 The then head of state General Sani Abacha transferred his share of the
 money through a Lebanese businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman,
 Mark Rissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all the secrets
 were revealed by the investigation agencies set up by the successive
 governments and most of the Abacha\\\\\\\'s loots were traced and
 repatriated
 from the various accounts to the Federal Government Treasury. Out of the
 money my father made, he left the sum of N50 Million (Fifty Million
 Naira) in the CBN escrow account for further transfer into a foreign
 account and a sum of $60M (Sixty Million Dollars) was kept in a Private
 security firm here in Nigeria. Through the confessions made by the
 Abacha\\\'s Family, the N50 Million was recovered by the investigating
 agency from the CBN escrow account. But were unable to discover the $60M,
 which he kept in the vaults. The reason is because no names were used to
 lodge in the funds. Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS
 (PIN) and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills. Also
 the firm issued him with a certificate of deposit of the consignments.
 Note that I have these information in my custody. Right now, my father
 has been arrested and detained for interrogation. As the eldest son of my
 Father, I believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to ensure
 that the $60M is successfully transferred abroad for investment purposes.
 With the present situation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is based on
 this that I am making this contact with you. I have done a thorough
 homework and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to
 the funds and effect the transfer accordingly. Is rest assured that the
 modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our
 safety and the successful transfer of the funds. So, you will be
 absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable.
 If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email
 for more details. Believe me, there is no one else we can trust again.
 All my fathers\\\' friends have deserted us after exploiting us on the
 pretence of trying to help my father. As it is said, \\\"it is at the time
 of problems that you know your true friends\\\". So long as you keep
 everything to yourself, we would definitely have no problems. For your
 assistance, I am ready to give you as much as 20% of the total funds
 after transfer and invest a reasonable percentage into any viable
 business you may suggest. Please, I need your assistance to make this
 happen and please; do not undermine it because it will also be a source
 of up liftment to you also. You have absolutely nothing to loose in
 assisting us instead, you have so much to gain. Awaiting your urgent and
 positive response.

 BEST REGARDS,


 MR TUNDA USENI
