<body><p>Dear Sir,
I Hope This Mail Meets You In Good Health And Spirit, I Am, TURKIN EZE,
A Sierra Leonia. Presently, I Live As A Refugee In republic of senegal
dakar , With My Younger Sister, MONICA.I Am A Victim Of War And The Son
Of Late Chief Dr.O.ONUORAH The Assassinated Former Assistant Director Of
Sierra Leone Gold And Diamond Mining Corporation.
My Father Was Killed With Other Government Officials During Official
Hours When The Rebel Troops Stormed And Raided The Mining Corporation
Office At The Heat Of The Crisis In My Country. A Few Weeks Later, The
Rebels Also Invaded Our Residential Building In Which My Mother And Two
Of Our Security Men Were Killed In The Compound While I Was Out For A
Special Research Program And My Younger Sister Was In School.
I Had A Singular Shock And Trauma, Which Compelled Us To Flee From The
Country To republic of senegal dakar By The Help Of An Army Colonel, Who
Is A Close Friend Of My Late Father,We Would Like To Further Our Education If
Not For The Death Of My Parents. I Have Never Worked To Earn My Living
Since My Late Parents Had Enough Wealth For Us.
I Am Contacting You Now Because Of The Present Difficulty I Am Facing.
Unfortunately My Father's Two Accounts In West Africa Have Recently Been
Frozen.However This Did Not Affect The Twenty Million And Six Hundred
Thousand Dollars(Us$ 20,600,000), Which He Kept In a Foreign Finance Fairm
Banking On My Name As The Next Of Kin.
For Now, I Am Having Every Information And Document Needed For The
Clearance Of The Money In The Foreign Finance Firm Banking Here With Me And
I Want You To Act As The Beneficiary Of The Fund For Easy And Smooth
Transfer To Your Account Abroad For Investment Purposes.
You Will No Doubt Be Adequately Compensated With As Well As A Percentage
Of The Profit From Investment Of The Fund. Also You Will See To It That
My Sister And I Come Over To Your Country At The Earliest Possible Time.
I Am Making This Request To You With Tears In My Eyes And I Feel That God
Almighty Will Touch You With His Spirit To Listen To My Cry For Help And
Answer Me Without Delay.
Since Our Breadwinner Is No More And This Is The Only Hope For Life.
You Positive Response Will Give Me The Greatest Joy And Relief. God Bless
You For Your Kind Assistance We Have Agreed To Offer You
35% Of The Total Sum.Seriously Waiting For Your Urgent Reply Below Email.
