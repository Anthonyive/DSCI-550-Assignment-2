<body><p>Dear sir/madam,

I am Kimaeva Lioudmila, a personal secretary to Mikhail Khodorkovsky
the richest man in Russia and owner of the following companies: Chairman/
CEO: YUKOS OIL (Russian Largest Oil Company) Chairman CEO: Menatep SBP
Bank (A well reputable financial institution with its branches all over
the world).
I seek your partnership to accommodate the sum US$423M for us. My Boss
got arrested for his involvement on politics in financing the leading
and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris
Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor
Yavlinsky) which posed treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure
as Russian
president before he was reelected On March 14, 2004. You can catch more
of the story on this
&lt;http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2003/11/13/51215.html&gt;

the fund (US$423M) in question was approved by the Government of Russia
for payment of various YUKOS OIL contractors/suppliers to prevent them
from loosing the money they invested in the numerous contracts they
executed for the above firm. The Government had already
concluded plans to frozen all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail
Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal before I connived with the
Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who is also my partner in this transaction)
to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe contractors the above amount
which was finally approved for payment after some deliberations.
Actually, we have paid all our contractors both local and foreign because
they agitated for their payment when they had that my boss was arrested.

YOUR ROLE:

I will present you / your company as one of the contractors we are
owing so that you can stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum or
PART of the fund according to your financial strength or the strength of
your company. I will arrange for the documentation, which the payee
bank will need to transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this sum
to relocate to American continent and never to be connected to any of
Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates. The transaction has
to be concluded as soon as possible. You will be rewarded with 10% of
the total sum for your
partnership. Can you be our partner on this transaction?

As soon as I get your willingness to assist us in this
deal, I will give you more details. Thank you very much.

Ms. Kimaeva Lioudmila
