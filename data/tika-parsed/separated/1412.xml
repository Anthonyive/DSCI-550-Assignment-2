FROM MR. SHAKIR ABDUL
DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS UNIT,
FOREIGN REMIITANCE DEPT.
OF AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK(ADB)
EAST AFRICA.


                     STRICTLY PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL.



With due respect, I am Mr. SHAKIR ABDUL,the director in charge of audit
and accounts unit,foreign remittance dept.of the AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK (ADB),TANZANIA IN EAST AFRICA. I decided to contact
you for a beneficial and risk-free business transaction.

During our auditing and investigations in this bank,my department came

across the sum of (US$35,000,000.00) THIRTY-FIVE-MILLION UNITED STATES
DOLLARS ONLY, belonging to an international business man who
died along with his family on the 31st October 1999 in a plane crash,
in an Egyptian airline ( Egypt- Air) 990 - with other passengers on board.
You can confirm this from the website below which was published by
CNN.WEBSITE.http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/03/21/ntsb.egypt.air/index.html
OR www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200111/langewiesche .

Before our discovery of this development, there was no trace of claim
from
any person as the fund remains dormant in his account with this bank.
Although
I keep this information secret whitin my jurisdiction to enable us put
claims
and transfer the said amount through a trustworthy friend overseas whom
we shall indirectly present to the bank as the bonafide next-of-kin to
the deceased for a profitable and successful transaction - Because
after five
years the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account
as unclaimed
bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it is
on this note that i decided to seek for a foreign assistance whom his
name shall be
used as the next of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to
share this money amongst them at the end of the year.

Meanwhile, all the arrangments/documents to put claims as the bonafide
next-of-kin to the deceased,to get the required approval and transfer
of
this money to a foreign account has been put in place.The directives
and
the needed informations will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate
your
interest and willingness to cooperate fully.Infact, we could have done
this alone but because as civil servants we are not legally allowed to
operate foreign account in our country and it would eventually raise
an eyebrow on our side during the time of transfer because we are
staffs of the bank.These are the actual reasons why it requires a
second-fellow who will forward claims by our indirect support
as the bonafide next-of-kin.And also present a foreign bank account
(Old or New account)where the money will be transfered into.

On conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the
total sum as gratification, 5% of the total sum will be set aside for
contingency,while 70% will be for me and my partners here.
Please you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in
service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this with
you.I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until
you confirm the money in your account,We then come down to your country
for subsequent sharing of the fund according to the percentages
indicated above, and for investment purpose like in any country you
may as well advise us professionally on how to invest the money.
All other necessary informations will be sent to you when i receive
an email response from you or a telephone call.

Pls. You can mail me anytime via the above email address for
confidential purpose.

Expecting your urgent response.

Yours Sincerely,

SHAKIR ABDUL.
