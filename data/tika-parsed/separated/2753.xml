                 WE NEED YOUR URGENT HELP

Attn: Sir/ Madam,

It was a shock that has not left my memories till date how my late father
Mr. Armengol Obiang the brother of Mr. Teodora Obiang the President of
Equatorial Guinea was arrested and detained by the present government of
Equatorial Guinea for being mentioned as a major sponsor in the fail coup
plot led by a South African Mercenary Nick du Toit on march 2004.

On the 25th October 2005 at about 5am my father a prominent businessman
was taken away from us by a group of uniformed men. During our visit to
him in his detention, he told us that he knew about the alleged coup plan
but did not pledged his sponsorship yet until the day of his arrest. All
the detainees were ill treated and are still undergoing such even now. The
President Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang has done nothing about it.

On the 20th of October 2005, We was refused of seeing my father. At this
point we had to consult the attention of our family lawyer who intervened
and further revealed that my father has died, the government suppressed
the news and our query about the cause of his death was never answered. At
this point it was not safe for us to keep residing in the country
graciously with the help of our family lawyer most of our family
properties and business were retrieved back from the government. They were
as followings: [milling company, Maswan Royal estate, Guinea printing
press, mechanized farm, franchise and landed properties] my family agreed
on selling them before our departure. A sum of US$9.6 million was
realized.

A high government official who was a good family friend to us arranged an
emergency exit to South Africa where we presently reside as asylum
seekers. The fund was in a diplomatic suitcase. And due to the fact that
as refugees, we are restricted to many facilities in the country of South
Africa like banking and financing. I had to keep the consignment under the
custody of a security company here in South Africa.

My dear, I need an honest person who would help me transfer the fund into
a foreign account, as I am not allowed to operate a bank account as
refugee. After the fund is transferred into your bank account my family
shall come over to where ever  the transfer is done to begin a new life.

I am residing here in South Africa with my mother, Mrs. Stella Maria
Obiang and My name is Charles Obiang.

We have agreed that 30% of the total sum shall be given to anyone who
would help us in this transaction and 5% will be used to settle every
expense that was incurred during the course of the transfer.

The following conditions must be noted:

The person needed:

a. Must not be a minor

b. Legal in the country he/she resides

c. He/ She must have a prove of his / her legality.

NB: All the parties must keep a prove of their expenditures for
reimbursement immediately the fund is transferred. We would like you to do
feasibility studies on how and which area in your country we could invest
our part of fund as soon as we arrive into your country.

Please call me +27-78-267-1213 if you can be able to assist my family, and
do send me your phone number.

PLEASE REPLY TO MY PRIVATE EMAIL: (charlesobiang@tsamail.co.za)

Yours faithfully,
Charles Obiang
(For the Family)
