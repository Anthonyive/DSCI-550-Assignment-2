Kindest Attention, I am MR.Glas philip director of operations with 



favovr Bank in London, my late customer an expatriate was killed in an 



unknown circumstances and before his death he had some unclaimed 



treasury bills (Bonds) with volks Bank in London. I decided to search 



for any of my late customer's relative which have been very difficult 



for me before those treasury bills(Bonds) get confisticated or declared 



unserviceable by the bank. In 2002 he invested in treasury bill bonds 



here in London in my bank totalling 15.3 million pound sterlings which 



was due to be collected in 2005 with acrued dividends.On my yearly 



appraisal of my customer at the turn of every year, I discovered that 



his investment is overdue for retrieval.I put up series of mail to Mr 



George Reid which were sent back uncollected.I later discovered that He 



passed on in february 2004.I tried to contact any of his relatives but 



to no avail, hence I decided to contact you to come in as his next of 



kin. I will prepare every operation that will assist your claim, The 



treasury bills(Bonds) will be released to you within 10 working days 



after you have filed in for claims.For your assistance you shall have 



30% of the entire sum.This transaction is 100% risk free and any risks 



will be on me as the director of operations so be rest assured. I would 



want you to send me your full names your phone number and your mailing 



address to enable me talk to you before I send you the certificate of 



deposit.As soon as I hear from you, I will send you the documents and 



other relevant information relating to this transaction.I believe in 



confidentiality and openess with regard to this transaction. I will 



like you to acknowledge the receipt of this e-mail as soon as possible  



and treat with absolute confidentiality and sincerity.I look forward to 



your quick reply. Sincerely, MR.Glas Philip
