<body><div class="email-entry"><p><p>FROM: DR. OBOH LUIS (alternative email
address:rimomoh1@hknetmail.com).

Compliments of the season. I would like to firstly send to
you the best wishes of good health and success in your
pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in
this letter. Before going into details of my proposal to
you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost
confidentiality, as this is required for its success.
My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal
Government of Nigeria,s Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who
are interested in diverting some funds that are presently
floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria.
In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your
assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated
account the said floating funds. We are determined to
conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of
2003. The source of the funds is as follows: During the
last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set
up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were
grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and
parastatals. The present civilian government set up the
contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the
instruments of payments made available to it by the decree
setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if
necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.
My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of
these funds which are presently floating in the Central
Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to
divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue
of our positions as civil servants and members of this
panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the
names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have
therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my
colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas
partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of
U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred
thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this
letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into
your account, if you agree with our proposition as
follows; (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for
us (the panel officials (iii)10% to be used in settling
all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the
actualization of this project.
We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project
in foreign stock markets and other business till we are
ready and able to have access to them without raising any
eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is
100% safe and risk-free. We
Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking
days from the date of receipt of the following information
through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name,
Company’s name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the
account number into which the funds should be paid. The
above information will enable us write letters of claim and
job description respectively. This way, we will use your
company’s name to apply for the payment and backdate the
award of the contract to your company. We are looking
forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit
for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction.

Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my
direct Telephone number 234 8033064962 and my America
Internet Fax number 1 92896 27169

It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will
bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction
when I hear from you.

Best regards,

OBOH LUIS
