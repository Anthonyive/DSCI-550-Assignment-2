<body><p>BANK OF CHINA
100 CHI LIN ROAD
TAIPEI 104 TAIPEI
TAIWAN

ATTENTION:

I am Mr. Tao Sung, Bank Manager of
International Commercial Bank of China,100 Chi Lin Rd.
Taipei 104 Taipei Taiwan . I have urgent and very 
confidential  business proposition for you.A British
Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid
Minerals Corporation,Mr Raymond  Beck made a numbered
time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,
valued at US$18,000,000.00 (Eighteen Million Dollars) in
my branch. Upon  maturity,I sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no 
reply. 

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally
we discovered from his  caontract employers, the
Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr.Raymond 
Beck  died in a plane crash along with his wife Mr and
Mrs Raymond &amp; Dorene  Beck in EgyptAir Flight 990,1999
air crash(for more information about this  crash and
person you can contact this website: 
http://www.s-t.com/daily/11-99/11-02-99/d08ho174.htm
Since we got this  information about his death.

On further investigation, I found out that he  died
without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his
next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that  Mr.Raymond Beck did
not declare any kin or relations in all his official 
documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my
Bank. 

This sum of  US$18,000,000.00 is still sitting
in my Bank and the interest is being  rolled over with
the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
ever  come forward to claim it.     According to Laws
of Republic of China, at the expiration of 5 (five)
years, the money will revert to the ownership of  the
Chinese Government if nobody applies to claim the
fund. The Senior  Executive Vice President
Mr.Sheng-Yih Hu  willing to give it to the 
government to have is own cut too, You can check the
site ://www.icbc.com.tw/  Quick Menu About ICBC Senior
Management Profiles so that you know this person.
Consequently.

My proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in  as the next of kin to
Mr.Raymond Beck so that the fruits of this old man's 
labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt
government officials. This  is simple, I will like you
to provide immediately your full names and  address so
that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and  affidavits that will put you in place as the next
of kin.

We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and
notarization of the WILL and to  obtain the necessary
documents and letter of probate/administration in your
favor for the transfer A bank account in any part of
the world that you will  provide will then facilitate
the transfer of this money to you as the 
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into
your account for us to  share in the ratio of 80% for
me and 20% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be  done by the attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager Guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. 

If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private
email address below. Upon your response, I  shall then
provide you with more details and relevant documents
that will  help you understand the transaction.Please
send me your confidential  telephone and fax numbers
for easy communication. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured  that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us
because I shall require your assistance to invest my
share in your country. 

Awaiting your urgent 
 
Best Regards,

Tao Sung
