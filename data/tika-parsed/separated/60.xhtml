OVER INVOICED CONTRACT AWARDED IN 1999 BY INEC TO A
FOREIGN COMPANY FOR THE SUPPLY OF ELECTORAL MATERIALS

ACTUAL CONTRACT AMOUNT MADE TO THE FOREIGN CONTRACTOR;
THEREBY LEAVING THE BALANCE OF US$20.5M IN DORMANT
ACCOUNT WHICH MY COLLEAGUE AND I NOW WANT TO TRANSFER

OUR PERSONAL USE.

AS CIVIL SERVANTS WE DO NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY FOREIGN
ACCOUNT MACHINERY TO SUCCESSFULLY HANDLE THIS
TRANSACTION. THEREFORE IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO SOURCE

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS PROPOSAL KINDLY GET BACK
TO ME BY SENDING A LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE ALONG WITH
YOUR DIRECT TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.

MEANWHILE, MY COLLEAGUE AND I HAVE DECIDED TO SHARE
THE MONEY IN THE FOLLOWING RATIO: 65% FOR MY
COLLEAGUES AND I, THEN 30% FOR YOU THE ACCOUNT OWNER
And 5% for contingencies that might arise or we incure during the
course
of this transactions.

FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE
DISCUSSED IN THE SUBSEQUENT CORRESPONDENCE. THIS
TRANSACTION IS STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND 100% RISK
FREE. NOTE ALSO THAT THE NATURE OF YOUR BUSINESS IS
IRRELEVANT TO THIS TRANSACTION AND THIS
TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE CO! NCLUDED WITHIN 15
WORKING DAYS SINCE ALL LOCAL CONTACTS AND ARRANGEMENTS

SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION.

WE WOULD REQUIRE AS A MATTER OF URGENCY THE FOLLOWING
