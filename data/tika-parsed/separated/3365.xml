<title>WORK WITH ME.</title>
</head>
<body><p>My dear prospective partner,

I am Mr Joseph Awaye, am the former Managing Director of Nigeria Ports  
Authority [NPA] Calabar Branch, Nigeria. I am from Liverpool UK and I  
have lived and worked here in Nigeria with [NPA] for about 35 years,  
so I have been in this country all my life. My purpose of contacting  
you, is that I need your urgent assistance. I have been retired in my  
company [NPA] and I have been paid my retirement benefit which is  
about N368,000,000 {three hundred and sixty eight million naira} of  
which i have coverted to US$5.7 million. After I converted the money,  
I went straight to the Western Union
Money Transter [WUMT] to pay the money, but to my surpise they told   
me that I cannot pay such money throught [WUMT], so I have to look for  
other means of which I can send the money out of the country and also  
travel out to meet the person that will help me.

Now I have found a way of sending the money out of the country Nigeria  
through a courier service which I have met with one of the official  
that promise to help me out if only i will give him some money of  
which I have agreed to give him $5,000 out of  the money and I have  
made necessary arangement concening the money and I have packaged the  
remaining of the money in a box which is US$2.6 million and I have  
arranged for my flight ticket back to my country to invest in a  
lucrative business.

More so, I have conclunded with all arrangement so what I need now is  
a trust worthy person that I can trust to help me out so the money  
will be delivered to the person, then I will travel to meet with  you,  
if you are God fearing and willing to help, then all I need from you  
is just the following  information about you:

1. Your Full Name  {Which is the receiver name}.
2. Contact Address {where the consignment will be delivered}.
3. Natinality.
4. Occupation.
5. Sex.
6  Marital Status.
7. Phone Number for easy communication.

Furthermore, you are going to have  20% of the total money and 80%  
will be for me also you have to note that this transaction is between   
both of us and there will be no third party. These transaction will  
take only five [5] working days as the consignment will get to you in  
four [4] days.Please if you are willing to help, please send the above  
information to my private email box (mrjawaye@voila.fr)

PLEASE NOTE:  A CERTAIN MAN FROM INDIA CALLED VANDIRAJ B. DESHPANDE   
OF THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS (Flat No.202,Ashraya Apartment, Vivekanand  
colony,Near State bank of India colony, Keshawapur) AGREED TO WORK  
WITH ME AND I MADE EVERY ARRANGEMENT AS I SAID AND SHIPPED THE  
CONSIGNMENT TO HIM IN INDIA. BUT UPON THE ARRIVAL OF THE CONSIGNMENT  
IN INDIA, HE WAS TOLD TO PAY THE SUM OF US$600 TO CLEAR THE  
SONSIGNMENT AT THE AIRPORT AND HE COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY IT. HE TOLD  
ME TO SEND THE MONEY TO HIM THROUGH THE WESTER UNION MONEY TRANSFER TO  
ENABLE HIM CLEAR THE CONSIGNMENT, BUT I COULD NOT SEND HIM THE MONEY  
AS WESTERN UNION MONEY TRANSFER DOES NOT SEND OUT MONEY IN THIS  
COUNTRY. SO THE CONSIGNMENT HAD TO BE SENT BACK FROM INDIA. THIS TIME  
ARROUND, I DO NOT WANT SUCH A THING TO HAPPEN AGAIN AS IT COST ME MUCH  
MONEY TO RECEIVE THE CONSIGNMENT BACK HOME. IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL  
NOT BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE CLEARING OF THE CONSIGNMENT AT YOUR END,  
PLEASE DO NOT WRITE BACK. AS I DO NOT WISH TO LOOSE MORE MONEY.

Counting on your co-operation
Yours Faithfully,
Mr Joseph Awaye.
