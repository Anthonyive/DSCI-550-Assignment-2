<body><p>Dear Friend
This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I 
believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and 
business partners. 

I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of 
Corporate affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write 
you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with 
the information I am about to reveal to you.

I have an urgent and very 
confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an 
Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM 
CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 
calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five 
hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his 
account officer before I was moved to my present position recently.

 
Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank 
manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a 
routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was 
returned undelivered. 

After sometime, I tried sending back the 
letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his 
contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al 
Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein 
(former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, 
as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further 
investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasserâ€™s family wife and two 
sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not 
declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, 
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any 
WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under 
dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have 
heard from the owner since 2003.

 I wish to let you know that all the 
investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of 
it, I am the only one that have the information.
With the recent change 
of government in my country and with their efforts to support the 
United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of 
this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which 
will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of 
above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it 
is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the 
country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely 
confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner 
to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this 
money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting 
you for an assistance.

 As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser, 
coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of 
Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of the 
funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, 
with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give 
you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully 
worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction 
will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you 
from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.

If 
you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to 
share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. 
If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message 
so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God 
bless you. 

Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send 
you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the 
deposit was made for your perusal. 
I wait your urgent reply through my 
private emailaddress:

Regards, 
Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.
